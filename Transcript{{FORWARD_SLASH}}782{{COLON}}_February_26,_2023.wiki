Now, in major polls around the world, the most unpopular groups are the globalist Hollywood and all the major corporations they control. And then Woody Harrelson guaranteed because I know people that work at Saturday Night Live, one would have worked Saturday Night Live, and all about the inner workings of Saturday Night Live. And everything they say is heavily scripted, heavily controlled by Dave Chappelle, when he kept on talking about Kanye West and said some things they didn't like, went off script. And they got very, very upset while he talked about going off script, Woody Harrelson who I know personally been friends with a long time. I talked to him two years, we've done some work together, but quite a bit the past I know is basically daily Lester. And what are you smart, smart cookie is dad obviously very, very interesting fella. Leave it at that. But he knows all about the deep state. And he came out on Saturday live last night, I'm gonna play the full monologue before monologues on infowars.com. And said, Man, I'm thinking of a fictional movie, where drug dealers drug cartels be talking about Big Pharma here, make you buy a drug and make you stay locked in your house to take it. So again, these are direct attacks. These are glitches in the matrix. These are people across the board, knowing that the new owner is going to destroy them and their families and they don't fight back against it. And we're seeing this intense fight all the time.

That I said, studying the typography of the media landscape, not here in the US but worldwide. And the numbers I'm seeing and the different talk show hosts I see coming out against COVID and lie in the poisoned shots and Big Pharma and the lock downs that they're going to lose not just their current push for force injections, and worldwide ID cards and cashless societies. They're not just going to lose on their force injections, they're going to lose on the whole thing. And we just keep pushing. It's kind of like you get in a fight, the guy starts fighting punches you, you're getting really hard break his nose knocking down. And you kind of wait and see if he gets back up. But if we start back up and go and kick him in the face couple times, and maybe break couple ribs, and what do you do with your family. And that's the analogy I'm using a non violent way for the new world order, what about 13 months ago, broke their nose really bad, and knock them down. And they are getting back up. So politically, non violently, we got to move in, get a good kick into the under the jaw, they keep getting up, gotta go ahead and start stomping the ribs. And it's just what you got to do. So that's where we are ladies and gentlemen, we got to press the attack. 110%. So let me make the new announcement. Like the big announcement here, the new annuity, it's 100% that on. The chain reaction has been achieved, not just on the poisoned shots, not just in the lockdowns, it was their big gamble to use that to get full control of us, but only in places like China, where they're able to get a lot of it done. But you know, Gigi ping is a test that a whole suite again last year, and it caused an explosion across the country and the back off. So he's been basically told and working with the globalists, that channel with the leader of the New World Order if he can successfully get his population out of their control but notice he failed that test.

And that is that if Alex is sincere in this in any way, he has an indisputable moral obligation to reveal who these people are and exactly what happened. Alex is lying. But if we pretend that he's not, then he knows the names of people who've run an elaborate psyop on the American public that has led to tons of death, the storming of the Capitol and the formation of essentially a leaderless doomsday cult, even if you believe that they met well, and someone else took it over after a few months. These people need to be held responsible for their actions. Presumably, they were public employees when they did this, and they are accountable to us the public. Alex not identifying them makes him complicit in their actions. And that should be a criminal act. This is all made up. So it doesn't matter. But just consider how if Alex weren't lying, he's still a gigantic piece of shit for actively covering up what would be one of the largest abuses of public trust in decades.
