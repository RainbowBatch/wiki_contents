'''Robert F. Kennedy Jr.''' is an [[InfoWars]] guest, and doomed 2024 presidential candidate. Kennedy, a member of the prominent Kennedy family (son of senator Robert F. Kennedy), has gained attention for his controversial views on vaccines, particularly his belief that vaccines are linked to autism, a position widely discredited by scientific research.

He primarily finds common cause with InfoWars over his bizarre antivax conspiracies, but has branched out into a number of politically adjacent conspiracies.
