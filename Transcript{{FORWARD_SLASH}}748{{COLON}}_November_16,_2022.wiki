    | text      = This is such a bullshit like these assholes pat themselves on the back so hard every time one of the random denials they make accidentally happens to end up being accurate. Alex did say that he thought the missile that he had Poland was a surface to air missile from Ukraine and it's now appearing that that is the case, but it's so dishonest for him to pretend he was the only person talking about this. A Newsweek article from a day before this episode was recorded said quote, The Associated Press initially cited an unnamed senior US intelligence confirming that Russia was indeed behind the cross border strike. hours later, the same outlets cited three US officials who said preliminary assessment suggests the missile was fired by Ukrainian forces in an attempt to to intercept an incoming Russian missile. On the same day as this episode Business Insider published an article including quote, a statement from the Office of Poland's president said it was highly probable that Ukraine had launched the surface to air missile in response to the Russian barrage and that quote, we have no evidence at the moment that the Russian made s 300 missile was fired by Russian forces. Sure. There were a lot of people, some random people on Twitter and some in official positions, who were jumping the gun to blame Russia, that is fair enough. But what Alex and Roger are doing is just as bad as any of those people. They're manufacturing a fake consensus that they stand in opposition to. They're pretending that everybody in the media, everyone in government, all the power establishment, we're pushing the message that Russia did this on purpose, and that Article Five should be invoked, and that it was only Infowars. The wrongly maligned, but always write truth tellers, who had the courage to stand up and say that it looks like it could be a surface to air missile. This is an illusion. They weren't the only ones to voice this kind of concern. And this possibility, this is a white supremacist outlet, and they're constantly wrong about almost everything. Alex didn't think Putin was going to try and invade past the dawn boss and said that Zelinsky was a double agent working for Putin. He said that Russia had paid off the Ukrainian army. So the war was only going to last a few days. He said that Putin was going to pump up probably nuke us tomorrow for like the last two months. Alex is full of shit. But every now and again, one of the things that he says out of a knee jerk defiance accidentally happens to end up looking accurate. And you can tell how rare it is by how excited he gets and how often he needs to bring these things up. Yeah, he's played this clip of him saying The missile was a surface to air missile three times on this episode, I believe. And I think and think about every time he has to answer for how he's constantly wrong about everything. He just yells Jussie Smollett, and things like Okay, great. Yeah, Alex makes a gigantic deal out of these rare instances and pretends the 1000s of times he's been wrong never happened, because this has the effect of subtly tricking the audience into thinking that he's right way more frequently than he actually is. It's a pretty simple and very intentional manipulation tactic. And I guess it works.

Either way, you know, like if you're saying to me, the conspiracy theory is all the government's involved in this, except for the Ukrainian government have kind of correctly realized that if it is Russians have missiles, they did fire them. And even if it was an accident, it did cross over into Poland. That's a real big problem. Right? And that maybe, if it's an accident, maybe we all Just say, oh, Russia, Ukraine made the accident and then it's less of a problem. It's still a problem. But it's not the same problem. Now is it?

    | text      = So these are the two stories that Alex is operating off of, and I guess they prove that the government is trying to force people into being euthanized. Sure. The first headline that he read is, it's about this Canadian law. It's just the title of a Greg Reese video that was cribbing, mostly from a Tucker Carlson segment. And that segment itself is reporting on an article that was posted on Barry Weiss's substack. All of this just boils down to the Canadian Parliament passing a revision to their medical assistance in dying legislation, also known as their made mid legislation share about who is eligible to receive that care. And this revision was passed in March 2021. But it doesn't take effect until next year. In that revision, they repealed the requirement that the patient's natural death was, quote, reasonably foreseeable, which is to say that they opened up this kind of care to patients who are not immediately terminal, but might be living a terrible amount of pain that is untreatable, right. The revision also specified, quote, that persons whose sole underlying medical conditions as mental illness are not eligible for medical assistance and dying. That is something that is obscured by Tucker's coverage. And then now Alex is just completely lying about right even if you take everything that Tucker says in his report as truth, the person who he's basing his entire story on is 23 years old. So this is not a child. Yeah, the headline, quote, globalist push mass suicide is just a video that was posted on banned dog video. It's a John Bowden report. Just a lot of it is covering similar territory. And some of Alex, you know, talking about the globalist want to kill everyone. Yeah, yeah, the second headline is even worth paying attention to but the first one does bring up a fairly important conversation, which is the sticky issues around assisted end of life care. Obviously, I do support access to this kind of care. But there are cases where things can be a little bit complicated. I do think that these are things that people should be talking about. But the perspectives of folks like Tucker and Alex are worthless, they aren't dealing with the issues as they actually exist. They're creating a fake version of the issue to use as a prop to attack their political enemies and keep their audiences in fear about how they're going to force your kids to be euthanized, or whatever. And in reality, when we get to this, there is going to be I'm going to play a little bit of the Greg Reese report. There. It is kind of a weird situation, that actually I have a suggested solution to Alex and his whole crew dolt. So anyway, here's the intro. Alex, give us to the Greg Reese report. All right.

    | text      = There is no answer in Alex's world for this problem other than to let fursuit die on the street. Yeah, they would be opposed to the government paying for his housing, they would be opposed to the government providing me with free health care. So what's the actual answer here? I'm not saying that fursuit should go to assisted suicide because of the circumstances like this. But I think that this situation does highlight a really sticky issue where the reality of what he's living through brings into focus how cruel the system itself actually is. This video from the Canadian news is about a month old. And by the point Reese is making this video for sued had actually launched a successful GoFundMe, and he'd raised $60,000 to secure his housing, and he'd gone public that he no longer is considering medically assisted death, right. Varzuga has a really good perspective on the ethical issue about how his poverty was driving his thinking. From a Toronto City News article, quote, he said government should be focusing on fixing the issues causing poverty rather than the moral ramifications of those in poverty seeking made, quote, I think the proper solution is to not have that problem is to alleviate what's causing the problem. If society is concerned about people like me, and like the half million other people on ODSP in poverty, then bring them out of poverty. That's the obvious solution. If they were out of poverty, and they had a roof over their head and food in their mouths, I guarantee you made wouldn't be a consideration, the whole debate would become superfluous. I'm certain that Infowars will not follow up on the story and cover this comment from fursuit. Because they aren't interested in this perspective. They want to use him as a prop to build up a fraudulent argument that the government is trying to force people to kill themselves. But they'd honestly be pretty fine with letting him die on the street, especially if they knew like that they could call him a communist for his ideas. Yeah, or whatever, you know, like this. But this is a little bit of a difficult kind of thing. Like he has an underlying chronic health condition that is miserable for him to live with without proper care and a place to live. Yeah. And his poverty is threatening access to that medical care and the place to live. It. Obviously the solution isn't well, medically assisted suicide, it but it highlights how someone in that situation would look at that as like, well, I'm going to die on the street anyway. Yeah. You know, like that's, that's Stark

You know, and if you're saying that I can't have easy access to food, water or shelter, consistently or guaranteed, if I can't have guaranteed access to those, then death is borderline a lateral move, or at the very least, I'm living right next to it every single day of my life.

And because of that he's considering end of life, medical assisted death, right. That is the story. It's about the poverty driving this. Yeah. With the underlying medical condition. Of course, it's not just his poverty, right. It's being reported on Infowars as an instance of the government wanting to kill you. Yeah, and that's not cool. Correct, no, that is exploiting this person's pain.

    | text      = It should really concern any of Reese's viewers that he seems to be citing the Canadian government, but also saying that posts on social media seemed to indicate that this is true. Like, that's not good. And it should tell you that Greg did zero research on this subject past looking at some social media posts, he saw some posts on social media, and maybe one of them mentioned the government who so here's some things you need to keep in mind. assisted dying for children has been legal in the Netherlands since 2002. And in the intervening 13 years, seven children APPRISE themselves of that care, Belgium made this kind of medical care legal in 2014, and three children sought that care between 2016 and 2017. It's something that has a precedent and other countries experience tells us that it's something that's used by people, including children who have severe medical conditions that are not treatable and cause a great deal of suffering. Mature minor is a term that exists in Canadian and American law already, it's not something that's being used specifically in this case, which is how Greg is definitely trying to make it South shear. The Council of Canadian academies did a study and their conclusion was that the law already exists that mature minors can make medical decisions for themselves that involve informed consent, and that there isn't really a compelling reason that this should be any different when it comes to medically assisted death. There isn't something that makes this a different case from other informed consent requirements surrounding mature minors. Right.

I think it was anyway, the only evidence that's being provided here that the Government of Canada is motivated by saving money is Harrison Smith, another Infowars. Employee saying so this is not good reporting. In reality, the number that Harrison is citing comes from an October 2020 report titled quote, cost estimate for Bill C seven medical assistance in dying. It was conducted by the parliamentary budget officer and it was prompted by the request of an unnamed senator. They looked at numbers from the Netherlands and Belgium as guides and found that it would be about 90 million in medical expenses would be saved by this bill. Well, basically what they're both citing Greg and Harrison. Okay. However, it's very clear this report when it says, quote, many studies have shown that health care costs in the last year of life are disproportionately high, representing between 10 and 20% of total healthcare costs, despite these patients representing about 1% of the population. Nevertheless, this report should in no way be interpreted as suggesting that made can be used to reduce health care costs. Yes, of course. This is how Harrison is interpreting the report. And then Greg is using Harrison's fraudulent interpretation to suggest that the Canadian government is motivated by financial considerations to offer a assisted dying care says bullshit. Yeah, the actual report that Harrison is citing includes this part that he conveniently ignored. Quote, to conclude expanding access to made will result in a net reduction in healthcare costs for the provincial governments. However, this reduction represents a negligible portion of the health care budgets of the provinces. Dr. Tanu Sutro, wrote in 2017, we should strive to save on suffering and invest more in its reduction, which may in turn reduce requests for medical aid and dying, Info Wars and everyone who worked, there are a raft of liars, their arguments suck, they just make most of what they're saying up and the rest is based on them abusing primary sources and misrepresenting them. And the solution to the problem they're pretending to be so upset about is the thing that they entirely don't support, which is more government spending on social welfare programs. This is just a dead end of them complaining about something they don't care about to begin with. Yeah,
