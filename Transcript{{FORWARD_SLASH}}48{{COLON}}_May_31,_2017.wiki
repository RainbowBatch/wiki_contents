Jerome Corsi came on the show and talked about how he wanted to start a propaganda campaign. Yes, you wanted a new meme in order to fight the fallout, the quote, false Russian narrative or the Russia collusion? Yeah. That he called a meme as well. Propaganda on propaganda action, from their perspective. Right. So the first propaganda game that they played was this Jerome Corsi is going to get killed this weekend because we have such big news. Then Alex isn't even in studio, they do this horseshit on the Tuesday show pretend that they never said the stuff that they said on Thursday. They just rely on people forgetting that they pretend to Jerome Corsi his life was in danger yeah they know

Okay, because last week, he was talking about how he was losing tons of affiliates. Yeah, he's now marked all his products down even further than their Memorial Day sales. He's extended the Memorial Day sales chopped off like 10% from other things. Oh, and he's now saying I don't know if it's always been the case, but he's never said it. If you get on auto ship, right so you get your subscript to his pills, yes. And they just keep coming. whatever price you get it at you lock in that price, no shit.

Last time we hit 100,000 in like a few weeks. You're showing people did it successfully and then still other folks were doing it so I still pay it out to some other folks.

Because they're preparing riots this summer. They want to pull back now and have the media act like they're not for the violence because they're getting ready to actually trigger it. They've got it built up and ready. Now they want to start crying it a month out from July, before they trigger it. We're almost exactly a month out from the July 3 riots. They're publicly planning nationwide. Like they're all for peace, so they can act like they repudiated those calling for violence ahead of it, and ahead of them launching false flags on patriots.
