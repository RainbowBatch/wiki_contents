Yes, Dan, for a long time, I've been of the mind that there is a type of right wing figure that I feel drawn to cover and a type that I don't want to use my limited amount of time focusing on. Some of the folks in that second category are there because I feel like other people are competently covering them. And there may be little more that I could add to the conversation if we did engage. For example, I think that Dave Rubin is a subject that I don't really want to cover because he gets some good mockery from Sam cedar and timber on toast Baden incredible in depth takedown of his rhetorical techniques, and the show itself, which you can find on YouTube, covering his actual show would likely just involve me repeating critiques that are already well articulated. And man cares

    | text      = I know. I know what I can and can't do. I don't think there's more to end there. Yeah, others are in that category, because I feel like their primary game involves comedy. Joe Rogan generally falls into this category. And I could probably cover any episode of his show for our podcast, but it would end up drifting into territory where we would just be overanalyzing idiots making edgy offensive jokes. These are the sort of figures that I might cover but it's kind of a case by case situation.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 08:07
    | text      = figures that I don't cover because they're basically troll attention chasers without any real merit past that point. Steven Crowder is one of these folks. Tim Poole is also someone who I would include in that category. And I've had a number of people suggest that we cover pool in the past and I've never wanted to because he sucks really hard and I don't even feel like taking him seriously is worth the time. I feel like he is a cloud chaser is an overused term.

But I feel a calling to branch out a little bit more at some trends appear to be growing in our country. And other people who are Alex adjacent could probably use a bit more of the focused attention that we use to to help bring the larger understanding of what they're all about and how they miss inform audiences for similar purposes that Infowars does.

    | text      = It's pretty cute that Tim is pretending to not understand why it's a completely fucked up thing for the former president and candidate to to be president again, is having a meeting with these kinds of fucked up figures. I guess he's been away from the spotlight for long enough to people to forget what an embarrassing loser Milo is. But here he is. I wonder how he feels about his book's title now that his brand is that he's a former homosexual, probably not thrilled about that choice. Leaving that nonsense aside, even when he was a trolling gay Maga scam guy, Milo was a Catholic fascist. He said as much in an interview with Nick Fuentes years back and his views haven't gotten better over time. Nick Fuentes is in the most generous description, a literal white identity extremist who has a history of Holocaust denial and spreading anti semitic conspiracy theories. He attended the unite the right rally in 2017, when he was just 18, marching side by side with Nazis chanting blood and soil and Jews won't replace us. Yeah. And then we've seen what's happened with EA lately. He's having a very intense but public meltdown. And he's fallen in with Ventus and Milo, which I guess is forming the brain trust for his 2024 presidential campaign slash publicity stunt. There may be a mental health component to this, but ultimately, I'm not in the business of infantilizing yay. And he's entered a space where manic episode or not he what he's doing is gonna get people killed. Yang is one of the biggest rappers of the past couple decades and as a gigantic fan base. When he does something like endorse Nick Quintessa or Milo and publicly associate with them and take them along to meet with Trump, that sends a message to his fans. It's really depressing to imagine the number of people who would never have heard of Nick last for this association. And it's a real impact.

But I mean, it just doesn't make sense. They're all white nationalists. The only people who like yay now are conservatives. And it's not like yeah, it was already selling shit tons of albums to conservatives and all of his fans were there.

Um, maybe a lot of people think that it's slipped off a little bit, but I don't think that, you know, there is the exodus of all of his fans in the way that you're imagining. Okay, second, I think even if there is a evolution of the fan base, let's say sure, there is still a massive celebrity here, right. And that's something that needs to be factored in. Sure is a star quality and beyond that there is a piece of it that is just people won't not pay attention to this, right because of a super famous brush. Now that's true. So I've said this many times, and I'm gonna say it again, Nick is a little bit of a scam type character, but he's not like the other people that we cover. He is an idealogue. He is a gifted speaker. He's an attractive young man. And he studied debate in high school, which has developed in him the ability to sound convincing to people who aren't listening to him critically, even if what he's saying is complete bullshit. He understands the optical value of appearance over substance. By the time someone can realize he's wrong about something he's already on to the next point. And that's pretty typical.

Milo has that experience and connections, but he's become a bit of a laughingstock that nobody is really going to take seriously.

And the thing they all have in common is Christian fascist ideology. Yeah, it does seem that way.

We Are Change was a group that was formed for 911 conspiracy shit and to push Ron Paul's candidacy which is pretty centrist stuff. Yeah, I know that some somewhat left leaning people were suckered into supporting Ron Paul because of his opposition to war and support for weed but people who were starting organizations to promote him weren't that naive about how extremely far to the right his actual politics were. Yeah, I find that to be level of naivety that I'm not willing to accept. Yeah, if he isn't some kind of a bit player in the history of conspiracy bullshit either. Like he's prominently featured in the 2009 documentary New World Order alongside Alex Jones, and his drunk Bilderberg obsessed Holocaust denying friend Jim Tucker. Honestly, there's a bad look for pool with his whole game we're trying to play like he's in the center. And he's a really critical thinking type media figure.

    | text      = Okay. Yeah. So you might notice that Yeah, isn't a big fan of finishing thoughts. Yeah. It's cute that he's trying to play a game where he has some definition he's decided to use for anti semitism, so we can pretend it's absurd for him to be labeled as such a thing that's dumb, and I don't really want to take the time to humor that shit. But this clip is important because I think you can see Tim's uselessness here. He's trying to ask a question about the dinner and very much doesn't want the anti semitism talk to come this early. It's too volatile a topic and that's gonna if that's going to come at all it needs to be eased into a little bit. Yay, on the other hand, is all too eager to talk about his feelings about Jewish people at any time when someone puts a mic in front of him. And because Tim can't control the conversation at all. This is where we are. In fairness to Tim there's no way to control this conversation. Yeah, he isn't interested in playing Tim pools games because he's super famous and he doesn't give a shit about Tim's crypto extremist audience. Yeah, he's already past that. He's already extreme. He's hanging out with Nick and Milo. And if anything, they were doing Tim a favor by showing up. I know that pool shows big and all but it's not yay level. There's no way to control this conversation because he doesn't give a shit. And even if he kind of gave a shit, he has to beget friends there to embolden him and egg him on. So honestly, if I were Tim, I never would have done a show like this. It's great for getting attention. But the consequences are really bad. Even leaving aside how bad it is for the public discourse to have this guest lineup on the show. It's really bad for Tim. He comes off looking like a really limp noodle. And because they left with yay, Nick and Milo kind of have achieved something of an elevated status over Tim. Because get this without Milo there's no way Yeah, it was showing up on pool show. From the perspective of Milo and presumably Nick and yay to Tim fucked this up. Yeah, he fucked up an opportunity for himself. Yep. And when gay gets into this anti semitism, defense of himself, all Tim can really muster is what library as if his goal was to challenge the source of yays definition. It's ridiculous. And it's a rebuttal that isn't designed to go anywhere. It's designed to just like it's it's performative pushback more than it is actual engagement with anything that's being said. Yeah. And that's kind of the game.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | text      = this pool is empty. Yes. So Tim really wants to call yeas, anti semitic ideas, anything but anti semitic. So he's trying to go with, quote, localization issue. Rahm Emanuel is Jewish and worked for Obama and Jared Kushner is Jewish, and he worked for Trump done on that isn't a localization issue that's grasping at anti semitic straws. That's what you're doing. Yeah. How does this theory even work? If you're gonna take it seriously, no one wanted Jared to have any official role that he wouldn't have if he wasn't Trump's son in law. That wasn't a Jewishness issue. It was a nepotism hire. And what about the fact that Rahm was Obama's Chief of Staff from the time of his election until October 2010, when he ran for Chicago Mayor, he was only in that position for like a year and a half, and then was replaced by Bill Daley relative of a former Chicago Mayor, Richard Daley, who isn't Jewish, but then oh, no, Daly was replaced by Jack Lew who is Jewish and was the Chief of Staff for about a year. And then he was replaced by Dennis Montague, who was a Irish Catholic. This is a localization issue. That's a euphemism that Poole is using. So he doesn't have to call this is what it is. This is a person who has an anti semitic conclusion that he's justifying, by pointing at various Jewish people and then pretending a point is being made. This shit is paper thin, and Poole can't even handle that. And because he's tried to frame this as a localization issue, he's walked into a trap that he can't get out of. Yet, he's able to respond back to him that people talk about the black vote, which actually doesn't even relate to what Tim was saying. But Tim's point is so weak that I don't think he even has the energy or to think it's worth standing on it. Now. If Tim had pushed back on the right thing and called this shit what it was then this judo move that yay, and my lower polling wouldn't work. It would be transparent how much of an evasion it is. But Tim can't do that, because that would place him in a really hostile situation. First thing he would land in a super confrontational argument against gay Milo and Nick Fuentes, which is a bad matchup for Tim. I know he has Luke radowsky there but that's not really going to help it still Three on two. Nope. And Milo and Nick are great talkers. Secondly, and even more difficultly Tim would need needs to win that argument or else he would be airing a live stream where he gets out argued by anti Semites. Yeah, he would lose that battle of ideas. And that is a real risk. So the reality is that Tim wants nothing more than to not really push back on this issue and definitely not call it what it is. Because I don't think he wants the consequences that come along with that.

Was that was that what he needed to intervene here? Apparently, so yeah. Okay, so this has been legitimately like five minutes straight of yea rambling about entirely, like almost entirely uninterrupted about a wide selection of topics with only the thinnest connective tissue existing between them. And now he's getting defensive about the whole thing about how he's anti semitic when he was the one who brought it up. To begin with. Tim would have loved to save that for the A part of the show that's behind a paywall, or at very least the end of the show, but yay, did not let that happen. Harley Pasternak is a personal trainer for celebrities, but one of his previous gigs was working with the Canadian Department of National Defense. One of the things there that he did was running studies on drugs and how they affected various aspects of soldiers performance, like things that could keep people up for a long period of time, stimulants cheer, etc. There's no indication that he's MK Ultra, but he's Jewish. So that explains the A's preoccupation with him. You posted a couple of alleged screenshots of messages Pasternack sent him where Pasternak was threatening to quote Have you institutionalized again, where they medicate the crap out of you and you go back to zombie land forever? I have no idea if these are real texts. And honestly, if this guy is some big time Hollywood celebrity handler, there's no way he would make a threat like that in texts. If the evil cabal was that sloppy, they'd be getting busted all over the place. It would fall apart so fast. Anyway, larger point, Tim is doing nothing here. He's not been able to come up with any decent rebuttals to this shit and the things that he does say end up getting him in traps. And now he's just let you a monologue for what feels like a lifetime. And that's not even good enough. Yay, still managed to somehow feel like he's being put on trial for rambling about a topic that he brought up himself. For pool I just wouldn't have done this interview.

If anything, yeh entered this interview, having just said a bunch of comically anti semitic stuff proceeded to say anti semitic nonsense, and Tim did his best to sanitize it so the audience could see it as something other than anti semitism. It was a localization issue or an instance of identitarian ism, but it wasn't the thing that it obviously was. This wasn't an episode of Tim given pushback TAS ideas and gay not being able to handle it. It was a case of Tim failing in an effort to whitewash the things he was saying, whether or not that was his conscious intent. That's exactly what Tim achieved or failed to achieve. And no shade on Tim for failing on that effort. Yeah, he clearly had no interest in participating in the sensitization of his shit. Yeah, that's like, it wasn't going to be able to pull that off. The problem as I see it, is that this happened in the first place, as you said, basically, the way it went down and all that is pretty much what you'd expect considering the players involved.

    | text      = Unfortunately, there are some things here that can't be ignored. The fact is that Trump has announced that he's running in 2024. The fact is that yay is claimed that he's running in 2024, in the middle of a series of public appearances, where he seems to be becoming increasingly comfortable. In his place as a public anti Semite admits that he's attached himself to Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulos, who are only going to push him further down that road to serve their own purposes. And Trump had dinner with yay, who brought his crew along. I don't think that dinner is something that should be ignored. But I think that the least meaningful way to cover it is to have a freewheeling interview with yea, Milo and Nick, like Tim Poole decided he was going to do if you're trying to get to the bottom of what happened, do some reporting on it, maybe tried to find a source in the staff at Mar a Lago who was there and maybe could tell you an unbiased outsider opinion, Nick and Milo are not reliable sources, particularly about things that have to do with themselves. And I think Tim knew full well what he was getting with EA. As we've said, a number of times about people like Rogen, booking guests is an editorial decision in and of itself. When you're inviting on people like this, and you're not fully prepared to have a very confrontational interview, you're having them on to promote them. Think about this. One of the only things that Tim even said about Quintus was defending him from accusations of being a white supremacist because he's working with EA. There was no acknowledgement that within the like the last month, Nick has called for the expulsion of Jews from the country. And that wasn't a like, what he was doing was like, Hey, how could you be racist? If you have a black friend level defensive Nic, that gets ridiculous. Yeah, that is a choice. And it's Tim showing deference to these creeps, because his goal never was to provide meaningful pushback to the toxic ideas that they're responsible for, for spreading. We do have to acknowledge that that this is happening. Whether we like it or not, it very well, well may end up being the case that gay doesn't actually make it to running for president. And even if he does, seems like you'd have to run as a third party candidate, so he may not even have to appear in debates. So the idea of him not being able to stand up to a debate might even be fucking irrelevant. But even if he doesn't make it to primary season, there is a reason to take this seriously. Many of them are matters for experts and other fields to discuss but from My standpoint, many of these roads lead back to Nick Fuentes being involved in this will give him a higher profile campaign experience, and bring him into even closer contact with whatever political figures end up supporting. Yea, in the same way that vanity candidates use campaigns to sell books, Nick can use this to network and raise his stature within other right wing spaces. This is the campaign that's destined or even intended to succeed. This is a design of pure accelerationism, where a gigantic star that the media can't ignore is used to bullhorn the talking points of people who are easy to ignore. The goal isn't to win. It isn't even to help a conservative or republican win, it's to take over the right wing. Anyone paying attention saw how easy it was to get the entirety of the GOP power structure to fall in line with Trump. And they have to have realized that that wasn't like an isolated event that wasn't going to happen again. If someone were able to command a similar amount of cult of personality and promise these GOP leaders the things they want, they will become yea Republicans overnight. Yeah, it's, it was dramatic how quickly that

And as such, I think it's now time that we need to step up to the plate and take on some of this stuff. I've shied away from covering some folks like this for various reasons that I mentioned at the top of the episode, but I'm going to reconsider that in terms of broadening our wacky Wednesday crew to include some of these other characters. And one of the highest priorities, I believe is Nick Quintus. It's very easy just to call Nick a racist and anti Semite, and that's all good. And well, and I don't think I would disagree, but for my taste, I want a fuller picture. So today, what we're going to do is we're going to jump in and cover an episode of Nick's show America first from just before he made his big splash into the Nazi adjacent big leagues on August 11 2017. This is just before he would attend the unite the right rally, after which he dropped out of college and really committed himself to streaming racist shit from his parents basement, right? So at this point, he's on era, his show is being aired on the right side Broadcasting Network. And, you know, these are 18 year old boy, that is a real shithead. But even in this nascent state, you can hear basically, very much the underpinnings of the ideas that I believe he's still carrying out. And some of it I think, applies to his behavior. visa vie gay, so I'm sorry, Jordan.

They don't play by the rules, they pick the ball up with their hands, and they throw it in the net, and they only pass to each other. And they, they run into the middle of the field, they pick up the ball, and then they throw it in the net. And then they take it out, and they throw it in the net. And they take it out. And then they throw it in the net. And they're winning. They're just running up the scoreboard one two, you know, you don't see high scores in soccer, because it's a ridiculous sport. But you're seeing 100 105 200 Because they're just picking it up and throwing it in the net. They're not playing by the rules. They're not playing ethically, they're not playing fairly. They're not playing by the rules, they pick it up, they throw it in the net. And let's just say hypothetically, the other team, the white team, they're wearing white jerseys. They're just getting mad about it. They're just sitting on the sidelines, with their hands on their hips, saying, Hey, that's not fair. That's not playing by the rules Black Team, you can't pick it up with your hands and throw it in the net. That's not by the rules. Look at our rulebook. It goes against article, one section, whatever of the rulebook, and you're not playing by the rules. And we're not going to let this happen. And they sit there with their hands on their hips. And black team just keeps throwing it in the net. And they're running up the scoreboard and white team saying, Hey, I don't like that so much. Except here's the difference in the real world. It doesn't matter how you get the points, it just matters that you get the points and the loser dies. The loser is exterminated. Once they get to a point where the black team gets a huge lead 's last tech sales white team. And that's basically the world we're living in. I don't have to spell out the analogy. But that's basically it. Which is you have people on white team that are saying, Let's do whatever it takes to win. And then everyone else on the white team is saying, No, that's not fair. We have to play by the rules. We will not play until everyone plays by the rules. And you understand what happens. White Team may have the rulebook, white team may have played ethically they were so fair, they were so moral. They were so virtuous.

The free speech part isn't important to them at all on the basis of it being a principle, they would gladly crushed the speech rights of people they didn't like were they in charge, but they know that they can cry free speech in order to mask what their rallies and ideologies are actually about. This trend is really consistent on the right wing, like think about how all the anti lockdown protests that happened over the last few years were really more or less just radicalization points for anti vaxxers to spread their ideology. The far right has an internal awareness that their ideas are things that most people hate.

He might not I haven't checked in a while. But what do what do just about every single one of the results that come up and Google have in common Gee, weird. Was it their miraculous? Was it their miraculous influential inventions? No, that's not quite it. They have. They have George Washington Carver before they have Thomas Edison. So you know, that can't be it. Gee, what could it be? Who are they deliberately excluding from that search result? Who are they deliberately revising history to exclude?

Oh, finally, Thomas Edison. Of course. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, like 100 other things. Probably one of the greatest inventors of all time. Number six. All right, number six. He's Elijah McCoy. Madam Walker. Garrett Morgan Lewis Latimer, George Washington Carver. After Edison, you have Lonnie Johnson. Oh, good old Lonnie Johnson.

He doesn't know who any of these people are, which makes the opposite argument than what I think Nick is intending when that yeah, no one knows about these people. But what did they invent? Garrett Morgan invented the traffic light and a smoke hood which allowed firefighters to withstand smoke exposure and still be able to breathe. Louis Latimer worked for Edison and actually holds the patent for electric lamps. He also invented one of the early forms of air conditioning. Elijah McCoy invented the automatic lubricator for steam engines essentially revolutionising railroad travel both in terms of civilian use, as well as for commercial purposes. Madam Walker is remembered as the first female self made millionaire in US history and developed haircare systems for black women. Lonnie Johnson invented the Supersoaker, one of the best selling toys of all time, and has worked developing tech while working at NASA as an engineer on spaceships. Granville Woods, invented automatic brakes, the steam boiler, furnace, and a raft of other railroad related things. He is often called the Black Edison, but I guess Nick hasn't heard of him. Patricia Bath invented things that improve cataract surgeries, Jan Ernst invented the lasting machine, which allowed for greater and easier production of shoes, which previous to that was a severely complicated process that had to be done by hand. Sure. And it basically allowed for, I mean, all sorts of development of footwear,

I don't know, I'm alive for me to lay low and infiltrate, without going full Red Pill only because you really can't make the argument without the truth. And in order to lay low, you can't tell the truth. So you argue with people about immigration. And at a certain point, you can't argue about culture, right? At a certain point, it becomes very difficult to say, well, we don't want immigration, because of downward pressure on low wage work, low skilled work and their wages gets very difficult at a certain point to not make the whole case not make the full case with everything that you know what the truth is that you can't talk about.

    | text      = Navicat asks Nick, do you think it is wise to go full white nationalism, rather than to take it slowly infiltrate the system from within and then promote nationalism when You actually have power? No, I think. I think it's ill advised. And I say that with experience, I'll tell you a little eight total fucking tags weren't here. Last week when I went to the job training in DC, I went to a job training to work for a do tank is certain to tank, a think tank, and I was in the job training for it. And I was disqualified on my first day, disqualified on my first day, it was like a two week job training to be a field representative, pretty benign, pretty simple position. And this was a think tank that's pretty much like an umbrella group. It's a big tent group where they have a lot of people in there. I know people in there that agree with me on a lot of things. I know people that agree with me on a lot of things. It's a big tent group, they have people, libertarians, conservatives, Paleo cons, all kinds of people. Now I go there to get the job to be a field representative in Wisconsin. And I was disqualified on day one by this dopey girl named Ivy from Lebanon, because I said I wanted to protect my people, because I was against immigration. Now immigration is a conservative issue to be against illegal and to some extent illegal immigration. That's the policy of our president. That's the policy of our party so subtle. And yet I get disqualified from even getting an entry level job at this conservative big 10 think tank because I said I was against immigration because I wanted to protect my people. And you realize two things. Number one, it's very difficult to hide, you have to basically go completely dark completely normally. And at that point, I think you're doing a lot of harm rather than good. At the same time, you think you're getting big, you think you're infiltrating, you think you're growing your base or growing independent. But the minute that you go a little bit further to the right, the minute that you go off your script, the minute that you go away from what your character that they built you up to be, you lose everything, you lose your money, you lose your funding, you lose your connections, you lose a lot of your audience. Like imagine, for example, imagine if Bill O'Reilly if he was still on television, and he said, I don't know, some kind of white nationalist talking point, he would be fired, he would be fired. And a lot of people would stop watching him and following him. And he would stop making money. And they would make sure he never had a voice who would be blacklisted he would be they would smear his name, run his name through the mud everywhere. And he would be he'd be like the new David Duke. Right? If you're doing it from the beginning as sort of controversial as sort of, you know, on the fringe, and not totally fitting in the mainstream, that's expected and it grows a little bit more organically. It's not that much of a shock. You build your own connections, you build your own infrastructure. Beyond that. I think the time is right. I think the time is right. The money is there, the support is there, the infrastructure is there, where we can really give it a shot. And I'm definitely not a white nationalist. Because if you're a white nationalist, that's the same thing as a white supremacist. So do not ever call me Don't lump me in with the actual Nazis.

You know, the time is right in the United Kingdom and Germany, in Poland and Italy, when you see the European Union, that's suing Italy to take in more migrants, like, certain things become definitely more viable for your everyday person. Whereas in America where people aren't seeing it, where you have 300 million people, and you're not seeing the same kind of culture shock that you are in Europe, I don't think people are as susceptible to that sort of Far, far right message. So you may have your extremely far right progenitors of ideas and culture and propaganda. But you have to have people that can sort of be palatable to the mainstream, to focus those ideas to make them to make them viable, on a mass market scale to make them appealing for the mass market. And that's the nature of politics. I'm sorry, but it's not 1917. Okay, we can't be the Bolsheviks and take over the capital. By accident, basically, with a few 1000 people, it's not going to happen. And they happen, I don't know. Fair. Let me collapse and they happen. Fair point. I think to a large extent, it's dependent on how can we make this viable for more people
