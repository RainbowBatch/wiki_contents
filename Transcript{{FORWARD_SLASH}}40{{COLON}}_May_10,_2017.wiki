Yeah, that's sort of what he keeps going back to, which means he doesn't really know all that much. Oh, you need the uranium deal brought up again. And then he says that people were complicit in selling our technology to China. And it's actually kind of interesting, because when I was researching the uranium deal, basically what it boils down to is that Hillary Clinton because she was Secretary of State, all the heads of departments, like all the secretaries, essentially in the cabinet, are part of a nine member organization called the Council on Foreign investment in the United States. And anytime a foreign company tries to buy something that may or may not be relevant to our national security, the deal gets reviewed by the Cepheus. Oh, that's how you say that. I don't know how to pronounce a C and an F right at the beginning of a word Cepheus. Who knows? Who cares? But anyway, there's Oregon, that's actually a really good idea, this organization. So when this uranium company was being bought out by a Russian company, right, it was something that got reviewed by the Cepheus because it is in our and Hillary Clinton as one of the members of this nine member committee could not have any personal involvement in the outcome of the decision. She couldn't have swayed that decision and the outcome of the the Cepheus is that they make a recommendation. And then the President can let the deal go through or he can put the kibosh on the deal. Gotcha. They don't choose what happens. So even if she had said, Don't let this go through, it's not her choice to make. So the idea that she sold this uranium is number one factually inaccurate, and then logistically inaccurate. But while I was doing the research into that uranium deal, one of the interesting things that I found out was that in 2016, Barack Obama did stop a company from being bought, because he felt it was relevant to our national interests, really, and it had to do with a recommendation that the Cepheus had made. And it was involving a Chinese company from buying a Dutch company that produced microchips out of concern that they were doing so for nefarious reasons, and would have too much of the microchip market. So Alex Jones, saying that the liberals and the Democrats are way too interested in giving, letting China have all our technology. There's a concrete example from a year ago of Barack Obama stepping in and being like, well, we've got to be careful about the Chinese consolidation of technology. So

But the rationalized that clean coal is coal that's presented differently, and you do different things with it. And that makes it clean. The biggest version of this and the only one that's really relevant to any national conversation, is the idea of carbon capture technology. You're aware of this, but for those who aren't. It's a technology that's designed to collect and dispose of coal plants, carbon dioxide emissions, before they escape into the atmosphere, because once they get into the atmosphere, they trap heat and cause warming and they focus up yeah. So according to this article in Bloomberg, that technology may be on the drawing board and an abuse of scale demonstration project, but it's not close to being ready for widespread use at an affordable price. No, the one us plant that's being designed to use carbon capture. Now under construction in Kemper County, Mississippi, is two years behind schedule and $4 billion over budget. Wow, a similar heavily subsidized project in Saskatchewan his demo demonstrated that outfitting the world's power stations with the technology could cost upwards of $17 trillion. So basically, some of the technology does exist. And it has worked somewhat. It doesn't work all that well yet, but it may in the future, right, eventually. But when it's too late, right. But at the same time, that $17 trillion number of outfitting all of our coal burning plants with it is substantially higher than all sorts of renewable resources that we can use. Right? That's why it's a stupid reason to go down the coal path.

Its anti free market and anti American fundamentally, because it wants to mount our head on the wall. It had to struggle for decades to get control. And it doesn't like real competition.

No. So the number is actually off. So I think I've started to engage in a little bit of research going through the top radio markets, right, trying to find out where the actual radio stations are, and find it. Every radio station has a website, and they have their schedules on it. Right. Of course, it just is kind of a complicated process of figuring out the stations in each city. Yeah, and it takes forever and so I started with Chicago, and I found that the station that supposedly caters to Chicago, the third largest radio market in the United States, is based out of the suburbs and barely gets to the city, right.

We know the theory of relativity is true because it has to account for that otherwise it won't work your your the clock on your phone because it is right means that Einstein was right.
