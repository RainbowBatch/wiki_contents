I mentioned, I think on Monday's episode that I had a speaking engagement which led to a little bit of, you know, tension, a little bit of push and pull with the schedule. Yeah, I was talking to my dad about this. Yeah. And I'm overwhelmed kind of Yeah, but it's not for any good reason. It's just because I have two things that I needed to, you know, basically, live shows at the beginning of the month. And obviously that was a lot of like prep and write and all that stuff. And then my bright spot for today was a was invited to go to Florida Southern College, in Lakeland and lovely, lovely Lakeland. And give a little talk there for the students. So cool. And it was just a blast. So I'd like to thank all the folks who were instrumental in bringing me down, I guess it was just one guy. But he was cool as hell is cool. He was great. The class was great. The talk was a lot of fun took me back in many ways to my college experience. Yeah, yeah. Being because look, the number of the students were engaged and they were had questions and it was great, but them were looking at me with dead eyes. Yeah. And I remember that I was like, You guys are my people. I remember that. When it was someone was given a talk and and maybe you get extra credit to go in. Do you just go years waiting to maybe go get high later? Or really high

    | text      = there's an adjustment. And we talked about it a little bit. I think even on the show that when you come from stand up, there's a muscle memory and like an expectation that your body has, that people will laugh at the things you say when you're in front of a crowd. Yep. And you don't get that from a college class. Often it's a class Yeah. you automatically have to like repeat your body to not think you're failing and like you're drowning up there. Yeah. This time was not such a big issue with that, because i i opened by making fun of my own speech. Sure. I'm saying that I didn't want to give it so you opened with a joke. But it was there was a little bit of sincerity? Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I was basically told folks, you know, you can interrupt me at any time. If you have any questions immediately, a hand went up.

    | text      = work. Sure, there has to be a receptive party, as it were. And that's a huge problem that I have with the idea of even giving these speeches is like, I don't know What is going to be useful to these people? Sure, I know a ton about Alex Jones and I could tell them all kinds of things about Alex Jones. But to what level? Is that useful to a freshman or a sophomore in college? Sure. I'm not sure. But if they have questions around various topics, sure. Maybe there's something that I can draw from my experience that would be helpful to them. And so I found that to be a lot more fulfilling and I think useful for them. Yeah,

    | text      = do? Yeah, there were two big moments that really stuck out like that. One was like we're aways into the talk. Somebody had just asked us a question. And I, I brought I explained Alex's changing story about the his view of the Ukraine. Invasion. Sure. And then the next question, somebody raised their hand and they're like, I don't really know who Alex is. All right. Start from one. That was fun. The second moment that stuck out was there was a guy who I couldn't tell if he was he wanted to fight or not sure. Sure. There was a little bit of like, maybe I'm gonna fight conflict is there it was, but it was just in the eyes. Sure. Sure. Sure. Nothing else threatening. Okay. So you have two questions. And the second one was about Bohemian Grove. And as soon as he said that, I was like, I gotta tell everybody. Story of Bohemian Grove, because these people have no idea.

    | text      = Was it Reagan? I can't remember it. I think it was Nixon. But it was Nixon. Yeah. Yeah. So good times, I wanted to also say, I don't really necessarily want to go through like formal channels for anything. But if anybody out there is listening who, you know, has a class or something they want me to speak at. Yeah, I'm more than willing to do it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think that people are afraid to approach me or anything like that. But if anybody has any reluctance about like, Dan probably wouldn't do this. Yeah, I think highly of the academic setting. And it's valuable. And so I'm always thrilled and honored to know excited to take part in that stuff.

Yeah, nobody wanted us. Right. And then maybe right from rightfully so. Agreed. Yeah. And then there is a point where people sometimes wanted us, and then we skipped over the part where people want us and went straight to the people being like, Oh, well, we can't get them. Like I don't know what happened. I don't think we have given off the idea of you can't get us ever. No, we don't have an agent. We don't have a man. We barely have a website.

    | timestamp = 00:08:47.000
    | text      = Yeah, that's true. Baby. That's the problem. It's definitely the problem. I think it's because we ended up being on like CNN and stuff. And we were like, involved with the lawsuits and stuff. So maybe, maybe people think like, oh, that's rare. Stelter canceled?

It's it's really frustrating because you have to try and parse out like, what are they saying for comedic effect? What are they saying as if they actually mean it? Who cares? Also is another thing you got to parse out? Sure. And then there's another thing that just bothered me to no end and that was like Steven Crowder kept saying that, like we have our sources up so you know that all the information that we've got is fully correct. That's like, well, you have some you have some sources here, but you're not sourcing Alex's claims, that's for sure. No. So that really infuriated me. I went through preparing an episode about it. And then I threw my hands up and said, Fuck this. I don't even want to talk. Yeah, no point. So we're back in 2004. Gut. Yeah. Good. So we're talking about January 26 2004, which is the Monday so we have a little bit jump in days. Yeah. Still, no conversation about the scream.

But we start here with Alex finding a new weapons inspector who has some things to say okay. And you we know from going back over this time, Alex made a really big deal out of the death of David Kelly. Yes, the weapons inspector who took his who died from suicide, and Alex made a gigantic disgraceful conspiracy out of that he was killed to silence him but concerns about weapons of mass destruction slaps, just a bunch of nonsense and we went over but it turns out there's another weapons inspector also named David.

Now, Dr. David Kelly, he was also the former head of the bio weapons lab bio board. He was also the chief British Inspector, he said he was lied to, and that it was a fraud. And then he was saying, According to the Times of London, other publications with five guys and black uniforms standing around him, as the police arrived, they disappeared and there was his body with the risk slit and the undigested pills in his belly, and no blood at the scene.

And that's because if he had to operate just on the fact his gaze would fall apart almost immediately. As for David Kay, this is an interesting situation. But Alex is also full of shit, Jeff, around this time, in January 2004, David Kay, a weapons inspector and member of the Iraq survey group was coming out publicly and saying he did not believe that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, and that they did not believe they would be found correctly, he would go on to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on January 28. And say, quote, I believe that it is time to begin with the fundamental analysis of how we got here, what led us here and what we need to do in order to ensure that we are equipped with the best possible intelligence, as we face these issues in the future. Let me begin by saying we were almost all wrong. And I certainly include myself here. Can you believe there was a fundamental intelligence failure, but not a direct effort to lie? Or exert specific political pressure? Sure, you can disagree with that or not. But what I'm talking about here is Kay's state of mind because that's what Alex is making claims about. Right? You know, so whether or not you believe that there was a lie, that's a different conversation. And you may have a different point than what David Kay is coming at this from i What's

But in terms of being like the biggest cheerleader in the media, I'm not sure if that's a fair assessment. Yeah. One of the biggest exposures he had was likely after another former weapons inspector Scott Ritter returned from a trip to Iraq and declared that there, quote, is no hard evidence whatsoever that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. And that quote, I'm not saying Iraq doesn't pose a threat. I'm saying that it does. It is not been demonstrated to pose a threat worthy of war. So Scott Ritter came back from Iraq. And he was roundly criticized for these comments that he made. But but but but war is God ba K was one of the experts that media outlets would get comments from about Ritter whenever they were doing these stories, and generally they were mildly critical expressing that he didn't know where Reiter was getting his information from.

It's all just about this. Yeah. Larry Silverstein was interviewed in a PBS documentary called America rebuilds a year at Ground Zero. Unsurprisingly, given the name it came out in September 2002.

    | text      = nobody's telling them about right thinking people aren't going to prison plan. Exactly. Alex isn't watching prison planet is going to PBS? No. Also Silverstein didn't say that he decided to blow up the building. He said, quote, I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire and I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it and they made the decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse. His spokesperson has been very clear and statements that when Silverstein said pull, he was talking about pulling the firefighters out of the building and leaving it to burn, he was deeply concerned for the safety of the firefighters in there and given the two other skyscrapers had collapsed that day. And there was a whole lot of related chaos going on. His concerns were very understandable. Yeah, it's makes total sense. So Alex is taking this quote from PBS, which he didn't know about for like a year then misrepresented it into being Silverstein saying that they decided to take the building down. Now that this framework is established. Alex is further embellishing this to claim that Silverstein said that they were going to blow the building up. Once that idea is firmly established in the audience's mind Alex poses the question, when did they have time to plant the explosives after the attack? This line of questioning is entirely built on eliciting an answer in the listeners mind that it would be impossible to plant the explosives after the attack, so they must have planted them previously. If they planted them previously than they must have had foreknowledge. If they had foreknowledge then the whole attack was probably an inside job. You can see how this path is built by Alex for his audience to go down where he lays out a book Shit narrative based on lies and misrepresentations of primary sources. He's not capable of it at this point in the present day, but in 2004, it seems like he has the finesse to lay some of this stuff out. suggestively Yeah. Anyone can tell you that a conclusion that you reach on your own is more meaningful to you than one that someone just gives you just the foundation of a lot of teaching. Sure. So I really think that Alex is trying to get the listeners to reach the conclusion he's decided for them. But they want them to get there on their own. Who released make it feel like they've worked shift? Back? Haha, this is my conclusion not Alex's right? I don't see this kind of thing from him at all in the present day episodes. And I think it's because he's lazy. And he's spoiled by having a completely captured audience. But it's interesting to see here. Yeah, that's that that is almost, I don't know, almost Socratic.

Alex chimes in Manufacturing Consent. But then what does Alex do as soon as that clip is playing? He laughs boisterously and unconvincingly. It's something Bush says he's doing the exact same thing that he's calling Laura Ingram engaging in Manufacturing Consent. Yeah. This isn't really what Manufacturing Consent entails. It's a much bigger thing.

    | text      = Whatever it was. We'll call you. Yeah, you know, yeah, that's yeah, that's not getting booked. Yeah. So there's some problems with Alex's methodology with his poll here. Yeah, the first most glaring problem is that he absolutely is not keeping any records of the exact number of calls he takes, and how many are for or against him. He doesn't even know that number for his own show, let alone for these alleged 1400 interviews he's done. The numbers he's coming up with are based on anything except his memory and his mood, which makes them meaningless. The second problem is that Alex doesn't have access to the actual number of callers. It seems pretty clear to me that this Davis guy wasn't just not letting people on who swore on the air on the to the screen Earthship, it's pretty likely that he didn't want to have negative calls coming on when this relative celebrity was a guest on his show. I would suspect that a fair amount of the people who want to have Alex on as a guest are to put it bluntly bottom feeders who probably want to impress the much larger star who has made time for them, because maybe then he'll have them on his show. Oh, wow. Yeah. what a what a back scratcher.

    | timestamp = 01:01:38.000
    | text      = Alex assumes that the people who get on air are representative sample of the total group of callers. But that's not a safe assumption to make. The decision of who gets on air is not a randomized process. And there's a ton of variables at play there. There's a side point to this problem, which is that Alex's selection of shows he's going on are not representative of the wider population. The only invitations that are coming in are from weirdo Patriot leaning shows. And that's going to lean though heavy in the bias. So where the calls are coming from usually he's not going on C spans Washington journal, he's going on a show where the CO hosts may as well be a rifle in a wig. The third problem is that it's impossible to definitively quantify what is a pro or anti Alex call. This is a subjective notion. So it's kind of meaningless. Yeah. The fourth problem is that Alex is an asshole. It very well may or may be that his personality elicits a negative response in a caller who may otherwise entirely agree with him. Alex is a sanctimonious braggart, and he's super judgmental. So it's easy to imagine calls that he could see as being negative, actually just being someone not liking him. And that leads us to our fifth problem, which is that even if none of these problems existed, and Alex was clearly tabulating all of his guest appearances, and logging all of the Pro and anti callers and defined those things, and he was consulting with the board operators of these stations, so he can get phone numbers to do follow up calls with the people who didn't get through. Even if he did all of that. All he could possibly get a sense of is how people feel about him. I know that Alex thinks that he is synonymous with freedom, but he's not. And the only real poll he is doing is whether or not it feels like the bulk of callers on shows who have loose enough booking standards to have him on like him. Yeah, so worthless, meaningless poll, yet I do enjoy I do enjoy the way he thinks there's something to it.

I'm all for abstract ideas about freedom. And I think it's very clearly lucrative to yell vague platitudes about it on a radio show, but these guys on their conception of freedom is antithetical to a big tent. They want the freedom to live in an area where they never see trans people. They want the freedom to demand that movies not have gay characters in them, not just I'm not gonna see that movie and have a gay character. And they want the freedom to force people to carry unwanted pregnancies to term because that's what their religious beliefs tell them. It's right. So it has to be imposed on everybody else. For people like Alex freedom means his freedom and it comes at your expense. For fuck sake, Alex doesn't want to live in a world where Muslim women have the freedom to go to a pool supply shop, nope, and go fuck off with this big 10 Nonsense. When your ideology is based on restriction and exclusion, you cannot have a big tent. The best you can do is have an incredibly small tent and yell outside of it how big it is, which is basically what Alex does with his above the left, right paradigm nonsense. Yeah. And it worked for a bit. It was all for a lot longer than it should but it was all a charade. Yeah. Also a small point, this conversation is happening because the caller was asking Alex a meandering question about how someone who works at the American Free Press was saying that the Jews did 911. So Alex has to dance around not supporting that because it's anti semitic trash, right, but also not flat, like fully rejected because the people who sell that anti semitic trash at the American Free Press are some of his best friends and longtime sources like Big Jim Tucker, right?

No one of these ideas or feelings are really hashed out trying to put a brave face forward, much like Davis screening the calls that were negative against Alex because he knew it was better for his ability to use Alex as the next step and cheering for him or whatever. These people obscure these, these horrible views that they have and horrible associations and, and horrible group memberships even maybe, because otherwise, it's more difficult for them to pass off their extreme right wing bullshit. Now, they can't make it palatable to a normal audience. If you know that you also think that maybe the Holocaust didn't happen? Well, I

They'd be like, Hey, listen, we don't want to deal with, you know, all that stuff. Until the until their bullshit forces society to a point where it accepts them openly. And then they blow up and we do it all over again, it feels like we're not doing it all over again. This time. We're still going. Yeah, we're still going with the same stuff. We went through OKC.

I mean, I agree with you, because, at least in the sense that there is a feeling of a culminating event, January 6, the optics of that the I mean, not to say that no one died, but you know, it was it wasn't the same level of like, dramatic right tragedy, right? You can't you can say spiritually, it's a tragedy for our country and all this desecration of the capital.
