Knowledge Fight is a podcast dedicated to cataloging [[Alex Jones]], InfoWars, and other associated right-wing purveyors of misinformation and bigotry<ref>https://knowledgefight.com/</ref>. It is a clip show hosted by [[Dan Friesen]] and [[Jordan Holmes]]. This is an unofficial fan-run wiki for the [[Knowledge Fight]] podcast and associated cast of weirdos. We try to provide both a searchable repository of information about the show and its content, and a way to dig deeper into some of the claims and events related to the show but not directly covered.
