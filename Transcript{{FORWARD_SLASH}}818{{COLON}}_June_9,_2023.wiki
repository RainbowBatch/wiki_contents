This is the first time in US history in our 250 years roughly, that a former or current president has been indicted by a federal grand jury.

But maybe you can't, because you have to make a decision. And there was no good decision. Sure. Maybe that?

Each one of these is an incredible story illustrating these people. Each one of these is a whole show. A psychotic Islamic Arab running around stabbing eight people many of babies with a butcher knife and if you try to say he's a Muslim, you're banned off the internet. And these images really never Elon Musk arrested if he allows this video to be seen on Twitter ads a clip of him saying that the crime is established babies the crime is letting you know it's happening. And the crime is those women. I mean, what woman would go out anywhere without a handgun of their purse? Oh, sorry. Can't have it. Majan that was Texas. It's 21 at that park guaranteed to Umbria and have a gun. That guy tried that he'd be dead in seconds. She doesn't load that revolver that handgun right is filthy chest. He'd be gone gone. But steady can run around in our lock bar and stab a bunch of these French women. How many of those French women you think boat of robbing borders think it's cute? Fun. Not so fast. Now he stabs those babies in the head. I got some footage of him stabbing the baby in the stroller out here. And look how weak that guy is, man. What?
