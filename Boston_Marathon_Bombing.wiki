The Boston Marathon Bombing was a terrorist attack that took place on April 15, 2013, killing three people and injuring hundreds of others, some severely.

Alongside [[The Sandy Hook Elementary Massacre|Sandy Hook]] Denialism, denying the Boston Marathon Bombing (and falsely linking the two events) helped [[Alex Jones]] to make a lot of money and greatly raise his profile within the American far right. Alex sent [[Dan Bidondi]] to disrupt press conferences associated with both events, and falsely claimed "crisis actors" (some of which he claimed or implied were the same people) were present at both events.
