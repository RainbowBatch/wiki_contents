But it's interesting to hear Alex so interested in talking about the big important news and complaining about all the distractions. Generally speaking, I completely agree there are way too many distractions in the world, and particularly in the media, but where we split paths is that I can say with absolute certainty that at least 75% of Alex's content is meaningless distractions that he's just reporting based on a tweet or a meme or something. Almost nothing he covers means anything and more often than not, he's just making shit up. I would challenge anyone who loves Alex's show and thinks his content means anything to go back and listen to his episodes from earlier in this year, and marvel at how many things were emergencies that mysteriously resolved themselves. And were never mentioned again, Alex's business model relies on constant distraction, because if he doesn't keep the audience hyperstimulated there's a serious risk that they'll start questioning some of the basic details of the stories he covers, and realize that he's full of shit. And there aren't any climate lock downs, but that is probably important branding to look out for in the future, from the folks who are looking for a new place to put that anti COVID lockdown energy.

Or is it Russia on February 24, invading Ukraine, after eight years of the last proxy war, enticing Putin to take that dangerous plunge while being on the precipice of thermonuclear war on the ladder of the RAND corporations escalation chart.

Yeah, that sounds about right, who right share. Also, none of the stuff he's saying is true. And perhaps more importantly, these are instances of stories that Alex reported very differently at different points of the year. COVID is basically an evergreen narrative for him where every day some new blog post or substack article finally proves all his conspiracy is correct and vindicates him forever. It's a fascinating improv game where he finds new ways to be proven right every day, forcing his audience to pretend he hadn't already been proven right yesterday new

And then with Russia, Alex has had to modify his story about that invasion repeatedly over the course of the year because he kept being wrong. before the invasion, Alex was certain that it wasn't going to happen. And at most Putin was going to annex the dawn boss, which was actually Russia anyway, so he had the right to do that. Yeah, totally cool. No big deal. Then the war started and Alex has gotten solid intel that Zelinsky was a Putin double agent, and that Russia had paid off all the Ukrainian generals who would just submit and the war would be over in a day or two. Yeah, that one was close. As the war dragged on, and Alex was forced to come up with rationalizations for why he wasn't wrong and why Putin was right to invade. He bounced around to a bunch of different storylines, but the most popular definitely seems to be the notion that Putin got suckered into invading by the West. In order to distract listeners from questioning how wrong Alex has been about this at every step. He constantly talks about how nuclear war is just right around the corner, so he can heighten things to a ridiculous level and be able to fall back on something like you want to split hairs when nukes are right around the corner. It's just a silly game. I'm excited for a year in review type experience here though, you know it'd be fun to hear Alex lie about everything he's done in said this year.

He did his most influential work long before he had the supplement line and every major event that he's been involved in past that point has been a disaster.

    | text      = So this is a good clip to use as a little reminder that Alex is basically an idiot who can't even do his job anymore. He spent the first half hour of this show begging for money and complaining about how if you don't give him money, you'll have God to answer to. Then he spent the next half hour yelling by completely insane nonsense about tuning your brain to God or Satan frequencies and then rambling, grotesque fantasies about torturing and killing his imaginary enemies. After that, he throws it to reports produced by other people. The poll. This highlights perfectly what Alex is good for. He's a really effective con man in terms of sucking money out of people he's already convinced to enter his revenue stream. And he's better than most at improvising violence fantasies. He doesn't have the shame that most people have, which would stop them from descending into these disgusting diatribes about what they want to metaphorically do to their enemies. Most people would find that embarrassing, but Alex has cultivated a persona where he gets away with pretending that the mark of his passion chair, neither of these things rely on any work. No preparation is required to peel off improvised murder fantasies. And Alex basically has a working script for begging at this point. So he could do that more or less in his sleep. Anything that takes work is antithetical to his present day way of doing business, because Alex really doesn't give a shit about this stuff past what he can get out of it. He cares about the performance of trying and the performance of caring so deeply, but at the end of the day, it's crystal clear that he would rather spend his time off air doing anything else other than working on making a good show. Yeah, because this sucks.

The government's having their meeting with the aliens, but the aliens who actually want to meet with the people themselves, the aliens are sending a transmission out psychically come to this mountain, come here and meet with us, you know, this 40 year old movie to me.
