==Detailed Show Notes==

Dan and Jordan discuss Alex Jones' growing insistence that Trump declare war on China, and how the media played directly into Alex's hands with the "eating his neighbors" thing.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/research/2020/5/4/episode-428-may-1-2020 Episode 428: May 1, 2020]</ref>

Topics covered include:

*Alex doesn't understand [https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181002-how-long-did-ancient-people-live-life-span-versus-longevity the difference between lifespan and life-expectancy]. He also seems to think that people only lived to 30 back in the 1930's, [https://u.demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html which is not true].
*Alex pretends that his outburst about eating his neighbors was satire, not recognizing that satire requires a point. The most generous description of what he was doing is trolling, and honestly, it's most likely it was an outburst that he's turned into a PR opportunity.
*Alex and Owen discuss the doctors in CA who say the virus is all overblown, [https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/03/cue-the-debunking-two-bakersfield-doctors-go-viral-with-dubious-covid-test-conclusions-2/ who have been widely discredited].
*Alex pretends that a Facebook post by Jair Bolsonaro revealed real information that the WHO recommends doctors masturbate infants. [https://www.businessinsider.com/bolsonaro-says-who-sexualizing-young-children-deleted-post-2020-4 It's all nonsense], to the point where Bolsonaro even deleted the post.
*Leo Zagami shows up to talk to Alex about how these are the end times, and how in 2025 the saints will return and the inevitable Armageddon will be upon us. Leo has also declared himself Jesus, took credit for 9/11, and was big into 2012 conspiracies, so take his predictions with a grain of salt.
*Leo shows his racism by calling Mark Zuckerberg's wife Priscilla Chan, [https://qz.com/1402697/the-amazing-ascent-of-priscilla-chan/ who was born in Massachusetts], "a Chinese."
