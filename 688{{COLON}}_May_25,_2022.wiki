== Errata ==

At around 9:50 minutes in, Dan talks about the meaning of Ramos' name in Spanish and Portuguese. Dan says that in Spanish "ramos" means "branches", when in reality "ramos" means "bouquets". Two flower bouquets would be "dos ramos de flores". "Branches" would be "ramas" instead. Ancestry.com also seems to make this mistake.
