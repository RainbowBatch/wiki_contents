Today, Dan and Jordan convene an emergency episode of the podcast to discuss the fake bans that Alex Jones has been dealt by social media sites in the last few days. The gents discuss how the meaningless actions further Alex's interests, and how Facebook and Youtube have completely sabotaged their own ability to ever deal with Alex appropriately. Also, they talk about a horrible, monsterous preacher who comes on the show.
