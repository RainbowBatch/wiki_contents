There were a couple in that in that attack. And it's been pretty clearly established that they were behind the Jakarta bombing as well. One of the more persuasive pieces of evidence that was found was the head of the suicide bomber, which was identified by multiple sources as being a man named as Mar Lawton Sani, who was a member of JDI. I'm guessing Alex could just say that that was planted there or something because he's smart, and he loves facts.

This was seen as a form of Western degradation so they targeted thing is associated with the West like the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta and that largely tourist area in Bali, where the bombings happened. Right. The group had received funds from an organization called all Haramain, which is a charity that had clear ties to al Qaeda. Though al Haramain did engage in a bunch of legitimate charity work, some of the funds were dispersed to terrorist groups like Jemaah islamiah, which led to the charity being shut down in 2004. Yeah, yeah. Al Haramain is a charity organization that is based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The point is that Alex is legitimately just talking shit, he hasn't had time to come up with any conclusions or weigh the preponderance of evidence, but he can't resist the opportunity to blame this tragedy on his imagined enemies and incorporate that made up story into his larger conspiracy worldview. Right. And so he's saying that there's a preponderance of evidence. Right, right. Right, right. Just saying shit.

But so it appears that what Alex is going to do to try and make this conspiracy stick is work with the idea that there was some kind of advanced warning of the bombings and that they were Feds on the ground immediately. As always, this stuff is partially true. There were federal agents there but not us agents. There were two groups from the Australian Federal Police who were working with the Indonesian law enforcement one on a narcotics operation and one on an anti Human Trafficking Task Force. They were able to respond to the bombings in Bali, considering that they were already there in the country. But this isn't suspicious and it doesn't prove anything close to a conspiracy or a false flag. And again, this is related to the 2002 Bali bombings as opposed to the Jakarta bombing that just happened right? That Alex is covered and is a different In Scituate, he's playing fast and loose with these details a little bit and I think it's intentional. Yeah. So there was some advanced warning. But that's not necessarily a thing where it was specific enough to guarantee the ability to stop either the Bali bombings or the Jakarta bombings before they happened. In the case of the Bali attacks, the US have captured Omar Al Farouq who was understood to be a high level al Qaeda operative in the region. His contact information had been found in the possession of number of senior members of the group and after the US forces interrogated him in ways that almost certainly bordered on torture. He talked and explained his role in the Southeast Asians sell of al Qaeda. The US attempted to pass this intelligence on to the Indonesian government because part of it involved a reasonable suspicion that they were planning an attack somewhere near the anniversary of 911. One of the recommendations that the US made was that the government should arrest a prominent cleric named Abu Bakar Bashir who al Faruq had named as being someone who was involved in the organization and planning of attacks. The political situation in Indonesia at the time was very tense with a secular President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was vice president Hamza Havas was said to have close ties with many of the radicals who the US wanted to focus on, including Bashir. So you had this vice president right on sort of one side of things, as a president who was on the other side is it was like tension, it was

He didn't want to make any arrests, particularly of religious figures without evidence of their having committed a crime, which the US couldn't provide. The warning that the US had was too vague to be actionable, and the Indonesian government was somewhat in a bind. Ultimately, the Bali bombings could not be stopped, but afterwards, the Megawati government began to act. She arrested Bashir and charged him with a string of church bombings that he had been involved in that occurred on Christmas Eve. Year 2000. Gotcha. In the lead up to the Jakarta bombing, Australian Federal Police were still in the country because the government had asked for their assistance investigating the Bali bombings. In the course of that investigation, many members of Jemaah islamiah were arrested and questioned and a picture began to take shape. That another bombing was being planned, but no one provided a specific target that they were planning to hit, just that it was likely that the group would attack a soft target, right? If that's all you have to go on, you can be on guard somewhat, but you can't possibly deploy the resources necessary to protect every soft target in the country, or even all of them just in Jakarta.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 25:29
    | text      = gist of the story is this. In November 2000, a British citizen named Christopher rodeway, was killed in a car bombing. He was an engineer employed at the military hospital in Riyadh. And in the immediate aftermath, the Saudi government said that this was not terrorism, but it was actually more likely a personal matter. At the time, Saudi Arabia had a public stance that it was very insistent that they did not have any terrorist elements existing in the country. And this would contradict that narrative. So there was an attempt to find another explanation. When personal reasons didn't stick a bunch of employees at the British Embassy were accused of carrying out that bombing with the goal of blaming the Saudi Arabian government. Seven people were held in prison for long stretches treated quite poorly, and a couple of them were actually sentenced to death before ultimately being released. This is a story that Alex is completely wrong about. And if you would just go a little bit further down the story he's using as a source. The credibility of these accusations being made by the government of Saudi Arabia might seem a little shoddy or, quote, a guardian investigation this year discredited the case against the man and uncovered evidence of systematic torture by the Ministry of Internal interior officials. According to defense papers submitted by way of appeal to the Saudi Supreme Court last month and seen by the Guardian, the man was systematically tortured until they confessed, they were subjected to sleep deprivation for up to 10 days at a time suspended from chains hanging from hooks above their cell doors and repeatedly beaten. They were told their relatives would be harmed if they did not cooperate and were offered early release in exchange for confessions. At this point, I want to make totally clear that I'm opposed to this treatment of detainees in the same way that I'm against how the US treated Omar Al Farouq. In the latter case, it was interrogation tactics like sleep deprivation, whereas the allegations in this case are far more abusive and gruesome. The fact remains that these are abusive and unacceptable on both counts. And I'm not trying to minimize one compared to the other or anything. They're both unacceptable. Yeah. Beyond the moral issues, putting someone into distress is not a reliable way to gather information. You may end up getting Intel that's accurate, but you also might not so it's often it's best practice to not view the fruits of tortured interrogations as being trustworthy. So the reason that I gave this much more of a pass in the case of Al Faruq than then in the case of the this they with the Saudi government blaming these British citizens is because there were other corroborating details and pieces of supporting evidence in that case that didn't come from Al Faruq himself, right. And it appears that the things that he told the US forces were accurate,

    | text      = So this story actually makes total sense if you understand the larger context of what's going on. It's only suspicious if you're only given access to the sparse details that Alex covers on his show. The sparseness of the details is actually a strategic aspect of Alex's broadcast because he's not interested in giving his audience a better grasp of news events. He's just trying to find tiny slivers of information that he can use to make every event conform to his predetermined storyline. So everything fits neatly into the the globalists are behind everything box. This article that Alex is talking about is from late 2002. The context of this is that the US intelligence community had gotten information from Al Faruq and other sources that there was a plan in motion to carry out a bombing in Indonesia, areas or buildings that were seen as Western or prime targets for groups like Jemaah islamiah, so they had every reason to suspect that embassies or government buildings could be under threat. The US tried to relay this information to the Megawati government who found themselves unable to act in it act on it in a way that satisfied us concerns, which left few options on the table for how to proceed. evacuating staff temporarily is a completely justified and rational decision to make in this situation. And it's definitely not caused for any kind of suspicion. Alex is trying to use this sliver of information that the US had considered evacuating embassy staff prior to the bombing to insinuate that they had specific foreknowledge of the attack, but this doesn't stand up to scrutiny. It's also kind of dumb considering that if they did have foreknowledge of the attacks targets, they wouldn't have had to worry about officials at their offices. Yeah, the primary target of that attack in Bali was Paddy's Pub, a bar that was frequented by tourists, though there was a smaller bomb that was detonated at the US Consulate office as well. Sure sure one person there sustained minor injuries, and it happened around 11pm. So most people probably weren't even at that office. According to the Australian police report, the consulate bomb in Bali was packed with shit. So the thinking was that this was less aimed at killing people or causing destruction as much as it was a statement bombing. You know? Yeah, you

And it's nothing more than him writing his own little story about this tragic event so he can use it to further his own goals. One thing I want to draw special attention to is the part where he says that they were pulled out of the hotel because of threats. This is important because it's a synthesis of this flimsy source about the canceled hotel reservation and that article from 2002, about the lead up to the Bali bombing, Alex's taking the hotel detail from one story in mashing it up with the embassy being concerned about threats, that detail from the other story, and then serving it up for the audience as if it's something meaningful. And it's the same thing. If anything, this is an abuse of information. And it's kind of silly to pretend that what he's doing is questioning world events.
