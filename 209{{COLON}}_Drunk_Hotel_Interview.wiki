Today, Dan and Jordan discuss a recent interview [[Alex Jones]] recently engaged in that is, quite frankly, tragic. Between his rambling pronouncements that everyone is to blame for his position in life but himself, his implications that he is waiting for death, his willingness to endanger his family, and his legitimately deranged answers to a word-association game, this glimpse into Alex's mental state walks a razor's edge between hilarious and profoundly sad.
