When [[InfoWars]] and/or [[Alex Jones]] need money, and they need it fast, they fleece the listeners with one of these farcically named "'''Money Bomb'''" telethons.

Early on in Knowledge Fight history, Dan would get pretty excited to cover these, but he quickly learned that and InfoWars telethon is just as boring as any other telethon. Somehow, though, Money Bombs generally seem to work out well for InfoWars (at least if you believe the numbers they put on screen), so they'll probably keep doing them for as long as they're on air.
