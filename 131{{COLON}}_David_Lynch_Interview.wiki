Today, Dan and Jordan try to come back to the present after wrapping up their coverage of Alex Jones' "documentary" Endgame, but the water is just way too full of garbage to swim in. They dip a toe, then decide to time travel back to 2006, when for whatever reason, David Lynch agreed to call in and talk with Alex, and the big problem this illustrates about Alex's nonsense worldview.
