And, you know, I, I'm glad I'm on knowledge, because you guys know, the mix.

So a lot of your paragraphs do have a bit of knowledge fight to them insofar as it's like, look at this sad thing. And here's why it's funny. And this is a sad thing.

Like, could you talk a little bit about how many or how similar a lot of these stories are?

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Will Sommer
    | timestamp = 00:13:09.000
    | text      = Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of times when someone gets into Q Anon, or another conspiracy theory in a really hardcore enough way that I end up writing about them, you can kind of there's often sort of a key that unlocks it and you can, you can sort of see the path and often they identify it, they'll say, Well, this thing happened to me, and that's why Q anon appealed to me. You know, for example, one guy who ended up in the Austin Steinberg group, he had this kind of crazy disease, I think he had cancer, and ended up on disability and or couldn't get his disability approved, he couldn't work. So he's kind of angry at the world and the government, and then he discovers Q anon and says, Well, wait, you know, no wonder this world is so screwed up. It's because of this Cabal, or, you know, someone like I read about a woman who got into Q anon during the pandemic and she was sort of cut up cut off from everyone and you know, she was sort of shut in. And then as a result, you know, she was an easy mark for Q anon So, often there is kind of this or there's sort of an eccentricity this person is into really deep into bitcoin they have all these kind of internet enthusiasms and then some then q&a comes in and they you know, again really go off the deep end for that.

    | text      = And I mean, that's kind of the genius of Q anon. And so many of these other kinds of conspiracy theories we have going now is that they're really big tent movements. And in the case of q&a, the clues are so vague, that you can kind of make it about whatever you want, you can say, you know, well, this, this was predicting the pandemic, or, you know, this was predicting the Chinese balloons, really whatever you want, from people I talked to, and in particular with Q anon and the, the NASA aspect that's been built into it, you know, they have this kind of utopian vision for after the storm after Donald Trump kind of seizes power and, you know, imposes a fascist America, obviously, they don't see it that way. But that, you know, debts will be abolished, or if you rent a house, you'll own it. And so, you know, if you're just kept or, you know, if you have a ton of credit card debt, and you're you can't realize you'll never be able to afford a house.

So it's more active, and there's more of this kind of, climactic moment in the storm, then, you know, if you're just getting into, let's say, JFK assassinations, and you say, Okay, I spent 10 years on this, and I think I figured it out.

Because they want to, they want to believe that it isn't real, even though they're convinced for a while that it is and right there, they try to get in it by their own need to disprove it. They believe it. Exactly, exactly. And then they spend all this time saying, you know, oh, this this awful thing. This has to be fake, right. And for a while, they just can't disprove it.

And if you get one wrong, turn, your life is going to be ruined. And then they find that that is the case, it's not an unreasonable belief, you know, well, right, right, right, no, and then suddenly, they they hit this kind of skid, and then often, through no fault of their own, or, you know, they have a drug issue or a mental illness issue. And then suddenly, they find themselves abandoned, with the exception of the Q anon community, which is more than happy to welcome them and say, you know, this is not just the abysmal state of life, and you're just gonna have to deal with it. But they say, well, actually, there are these specific people to blame. And the good news is that let's say you have cancer, and you can't, you don't have insurance to get treatment.

Yeah, later on a bit near that nearing the end of the book, you start talking about the way that Republican politicians, and the like, all knew that this was bullshit, but still tried to ride the wave or CO opted or do whatever, you know, manipulated for their own benefits. And there's a question you ask of like, if they had intervened, if they had done something if they had led Republicans away? Maybe things could be different. I'm wondering, do you think that if that if the Republicans had done that they would have changed things? Or they would have just been eaten alive along with the rest of them?

And so you have all these kind of mini queues popping up. You know, these just various Q anon promoters who sort of take it in different directions. I mean, obviously, a very extreme example, or with a group of people who sort of camped out in Dallas looking for JFK Jr. To come back to life. And, you know, one thing that's close, right, and, you know, they would say, Oh, I think that guy's Tupac over there. That's Robin Williams.

You know, the ones that we still talk about now, like Wayfair. Right. Wayfarer is another great example, the idea that, you know, they're just going to latch on to these auto generated names on a furniture site. And it means they're rolling up kids in cabinets and stuff like that. No one except a Q and M person could ever have thought of that. But you know, at the same time, I think we're gonna see, you know, it's the same time if Kuhn on the downside of it, as an observer of this is that it sort of sucks up a lot of energy from the conspiratorial swamps, and sort of everything just becomes this vague, like, you know, that's what they want you to fake, you know, just kind of like, oh, that's a distraction. But, you know, people aren't really like putting in the work. And so that said, the one I'm seeing right now is, you know, this Vivec Ramaswamy guy that's sort of the anti woke CEO, who's declared his presidential run this. Never heard of this, dude,

I mean, in practice, his ideas are just, you know, destroy federal government. Exactly. And so but but the thing is, because he's a rich guy, he has these ties to the World Economic Forum. And so now all these Republicans are saying, you know, your people like Jack pisode Becker saying, you know, you're an agent of George Soros. And so now he has to say, no, no, no, I, the World Economic Forum's just obsessed with me. That's why they put me on their website, you know, and I said, Don't do it. And so I think they're really going to tie this guy in in a big way. And look, it doesn't have the pizzazz of pizza gate or Wayfair. Or, you know, Tom Hanks, you know, his various conspiracy theories, but, but I think this is one that's really gonna get cooking, as we as we sort of wait for for 2024 really to swing up.

And it is sort of different and unique from other times. And I was, I would wonder about your take on this. Well, it's like, there is so much that is similar to this about that to like, the Satanic Panic, right? How much do you think this would have been? What happened if the internet was as prevalent? That's a bad question.

It's so wild how and you know, I didn't live through it as a little kid but it must have been a crazy time to be alive because how everyone just got on board with it in a way that really they haven't with q&a. We don't have you know, TV stations, you know, nightly news saying, oh, yeah, you know, turns out they're a bunch of pedophiles in here. We don't have police arresting people because of accusations made in Q anon. Whereas in the Satanic Panic there's still a guy in prison who was arrested on some kind of trumped up Satanic Panic charge. So I mean, it really was and maybe not directly answering your question, but but I have to imagine susiana Panic would have been even worse was just absolutely crazy time to read up on.
