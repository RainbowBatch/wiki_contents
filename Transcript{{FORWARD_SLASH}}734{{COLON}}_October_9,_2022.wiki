Pay Pal came out on Friday in their terms of service officially. And said if we don't like what you say or what you believe we will find you $2,500 per infraction. There was a gigantic backlash and they were voted and said We're sorry. We're not going to do it. You mean for now? They've gotten away with so much for so long. I told you Nexus D banking.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 24:11
    | text      = so there was a bit of a misunderstanding about Pay Pal that's now being mis reported by Alex to claim a non existent victory share. Here's the condensed version of what's going on here. Pay Pal has certain rules about what their service cannot be used for. For instance, you can't use it to pay assassins or sell drugs. In a version of their acceptable use policy they included on their list of prohibited uses things that quote are fraudulent, promote misinformation or are harmful. This language was subsequently removed from the policy statement, which I guess Alex is taking credit for great. They never were going to find you $2,500 for spreading misinformation. This is a misreporting of their policy that relates to pay pals ability to charge you $2,500 If you're sued for doing any of the prohibited activities, when using their service, right this is essentially a flat rate per violation that they assess to protect themselves and recoup expenses that may come from you using PayPal to do things that they explicitly say you can't. Sure, sure. Anyway, the story is more useful to Alex the way he tells it. But ironically, that's Alex spreading misinformation, which luckily won't get him fined by PayPal and wouldn't have before either, because this is a full of shit narrative.

Right. Right. Because then it kind of implies that they were guilty about Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. And I don't know. I mean, I said it was a mistake that that was in there, which I'm not sure I fully buy that either way. The reality of it is, you know, you there is no fine that was going to be assessed for spreading disinformation. Yeah. And look, I mean, it even within the language that was removed, like, the you can't use it for things that are fraudulent, right, that's still true. Oh, okay. Well, that's good. Right. Yeah.

Yeah, that's why he thinks society would be perfect and polite if everyone was carrying a gun at all times, because to him you can't be a victim if you're armed, which is also bullshit, right? This is a disgusting mentality that Alex is espousing masquerading as a message of empowerment. Also to touch on that point that he makes about corporations teaching you to comply with criminals like robbers that's really important and good advice. I've worked at a couple of gas stations in my life and I was even robbed at gunpoint once at one of them. If you work in a setting like this, you will have your bosses tell you that if someone wants to rob you go along with everything they're saying, unless they want you to leave the store, then it becomes a completely different crime and if you're looking at being kidnapped, you shouldn't comply. We never go to a second location but in the overwhelming majority of cases the person robbing you doesn't want to hurt you. They just want money which is replaceable and the store is likely insured anyway. There's literally no point in fighting back and risking escalation to situation into one way where people get hurt or even killed. Yeah, the same is true in a lot of stores. Like for instance, I worked at an office depot. And they very clearly told us that if the alarm goes off that someone left without paying for something, don't chase them, just let them go, why their cameras up. And again, the stolen item is just a stolen item, you don't have to risk your well being over it. In reality, there's an issue here where your employer doesn't want to get sued by your family if you're killed on the job and taking a hit of whatever the robber gets away with from the tail is small potatoes. Yeah, but whatever the motivation, it's very weird that these bosses and corporations seem to care a lot more about your well being than Alex

While the data in the study does show an 84% increase in cardiac related deaths in people who got mRNA vaccines, but there's some gigantic red flags that should make you would never rely on this study to report that data.

This section of codes does include cardiac arrest, but the section doesn't cover a number of other heart related outcomes that didn't make sense for them to exclude, that it skews the data a bit right. Also, someone who has cardiac arrest on their death certificate may have died from something else that led to their heart stopping. It's not precise enough to be helpful in this context at all for what they're trying to assert right forth. The paper has some issues with who they included and did not include. They claim that they include excluded anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID. But in the limitation section, they say this, quote, this study cannot determine the causative nature of a participants death, we use death certificate data and not medical records. COVID testing status was unknown for those who did not die of or with COVID. This makes things very confusing. They had no knowledge of the testing status of anyone who didn't die of or with COVID.

It's stale, repetitive, and you're really preaching to the choir, the audience already thinks the vaccines a death shot. So proving that over and over again is just monotonous. However, with Alex Lee, Moyers dumb movie, and Glenn Greenwald's glowing review and the mileage that he's been able to get out of things like that Channel Five interview, and his book release, and the attention that he's getting from the trial, I wouldn't be surprised if Alex was seeing some new eyes on his product. And some of these folks probably got vaccinated. If you have a new initiate, and you make them scared of this death vaccine, that's killing millions that they've already taken, and there's no solution, it's gonna be hard to make money off them. Conversely, if you start to come up with cures on solutions to protect yourself, if you've been vaccinated, then you can create this intense fear about the vaccine and then sell people a placebo to alleviate those fears. That's the trick. Brilliant.

But I also think that there's a line, I still can feel for people who are acting out in manic outbursts, but when they're things that they're saying or doing are destructive, and they've had multiple opportunities to get help and have the resources to do so. The primary concern that I have shifts from their well being to the damage that their actions can have on others. Kanye is well past that line. But it isn't really too often that he comes up in our travels because Alex has a dicey history with Kanye. When he was first doing his I like Trump thing and hanging out with Candace Owens. Alex had Owens on the show as a guest from time to time and I think that Alex thought Kanye was gonna come on, and that never happened. But Kanye wore a maga hat. So Alex liked him right? And everything was well sure. Then in July 2020, Alex got mad at him because Kanye did an interview the publicly announced his split from Trump, which wasn't cool. So close to the election, particularly right. And like that Kanye was once again evil, which in Alex's world really just translates to someone I can't use to make a buck, right? But now Kanye is doing attention grabbing nonsense in public again and talking to Tucker about it. So it's a pretty safe bet that Alex is back to thinking that Kanye is pretty all right after all, yeah. For those who haven't been following the current timeline, here's a quick breakdown of what's happened. Kanye and Candace Owens were at a fashion show in Paris where they showed off Kanye is new T shirt that just said white lives matter. This was stupid on a number of levels. Obviously, the intention was to shock but if anyone was shocked by this, it was a shock without depth. There's no art to it. It's a banal, kind of shocking, lazy, shocking, if shocking at all.

And that's pretty much what happened. Yep. Kanye is now embattled by the woke mob according to outlets like Fox because he dared to wear this shirt is a brave and artistic statement. I'm not sure if this is true, or if any woke mobs are in battling him. I kind of think that most people's response to his thought was along the lines of oh, this is happening again. wearing a white lives matter shirt while hanging out with Candace Owens is going to be viewed as racist type behavior by some but at this point, we're four years past the point where he did an interview and said that slavery was a choice. Connie did get some negative feedback from his shirt coming from P Diddy of all people. The man who enters through the Diddy door texted Kanye, which we know we know about because Kanye posted a picture of the texts on Instagram. Kanye apparently wrote did a did he saying quote? I didn't like our Convo. I'm selling these teas. Nobody can get in between me and my money. never called me with no bullshit like that again, unless you're ready to greenlight me because anybody that got on that T is me. This brings up an important point and that is that Kanye is selling these shirts so at its core This is basically just a publicity stunt. Yeah, did he asks for an address to meet with Kanye because his actions are causing distress. Kanye responds quote, This ain't a game. I'm gonna use you to show the Jewish people that told you to call me that no one can threaten her influence me. I told you this is war. Not great. Okay. Riley people were pretty offended by this and his Instagram account ended up getting the boot. So he went to Twitter and posted quote, I'm a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up, I'm going DEF CON three on all caps Jewish people. Wow. The funny thing is that I actually can't be anti semitic because black people are actually Jew. Also, guys have toyed with me and tried to blackball anybody who opposes your agenda, right? He followed this with another tweet saying, quote, who you think created canceled culture. People really didn't enjoy this seeing as it's essentially swimming in anti semitic tropes. And this is really just a stone's throw away from Holocaust denial. Yeah. To recap, this was an episode that began with him wearing a racist trolling t shirt to a fashion show with racist troll Candace Owens, and ended up with him publicly declaring that he's going to war with the Jews. This is a mess.

It takes a certain level of scumbag to exploit somebody who's clearly unwell. And it turns out, Tucker is right at that level. You kind of expect that desperate Grifters like Owens would take any opportunity to attach themselves to Kanye, regardless of the context because it gets their name in the media. Absolutely. Someone like Tucker, you kind of hoped that he'd realized that he doesn't always need to press like he's a big enough star and he's effective enough at pushing his talking points that interviewing Kanye is more of a liability than it is an opportunity. For instance, what if like a day or two after your interview your interview subject to you spent two days of your show arguing as sane and an insightful person declares that he's gone to war with the Jews. What then? Or even worse? What if it comes out that he said that kind of stuff in your interview, but you cut it out of the finished product to make it all more palatable for your audience? Hmm, what if footage of leaks that shows that you had every reason to suspect that your interview subject was unwell and also clearly expressing anti semitic views to your face?

And as it turns out, Tucker censored quite a bit that didn't fit the narrative of the story that he wanted to tell. Like for instance, he cut out quote, numerous anti semitic sentiments. Here's one of the clips that Vice provided that seems weird the Tucker wouldn't let him say this on the show.

We don't have audio of this because vice chose to withdraw, withhold the footage to respect the privacy of the child and their family, which I think is probably very nice of them. Yes.

Kanye has hatred for the left and support of Trump, his aggressive anti abortion positions and his vocal Christianity are very useful for Tucker, so long as the audience doesn't actually get all the information. Tucker's whole game is that he's giving you this information so you can make up your own mind. They say that Kanye is crazy because he wears a white lives matter shirt and loves Jesus.

And even so it felt meandering. It felt overly edited, but yet still not concise. What I'm saying is that I don't recommend it. It's kind of a dumb interview, particularly the part where Kanye complains about how the Democrats and the Clintons wanted to get to his wife so they could take advantage of Kanye his fame to push their messaging when he's sitting next to a guy who's doing exactly that just without his wife's involvement yet, at the end of day two of the interview series Kanye briefly mentions Alex Jones.

And yeah, I would say he's on Alex Jones turf here, speculating that the gap had advanced knowledge of the shooting. And I'm sure what that means. Also, real quick, the reason that tons of news outlets sound the same in the immediate aftermath of a tragic event that's breaking news is because they're all reporting on the same a very limited information that's been released by the authorities or witnesses, and no one wants you to put ice on your head. But the fact that you're mad at the people less successful than you are concerned about your well being means you should probably put some meds in your head. I have a litany of thoughts about this interview. But most of it really isn't germane to the matter here. where it intersects with our show is that tiny little mention of Alex and the fact that he was part of an anti semitic breakdown that's still ongoing and that folks like Alex and Tucker are actively covering for and enabling right so beyond that, I don't know the interview is you know, take what you can from it I guess if you want to watch it the yeah two hours to throw away

What a real apple looks like what a real orange looks like, you know, it's fake. You walk over it's plastic and pick it up. Yeah, that's fake. That's all Kanye saying. And then it's coordinated.

From there. Alex has extrapolated this out into being an entirely fake Town Hall, which I guess is evidence that school shootings are faked. Now, if Alex wanted to really blow some minds with this conspiracy, the 15 year old girl at that town hall was named Brennan Leach. And if that name rings a bell, it's because she went on to be a Senate aide who was photographed transporting the electoral ballots on January 6, some folks Miss reported that she and other aides were protecting these votes during the rioting, but in reality, it was a photo from the morning Sure, this is perfect for Alex it proves the January 6 with the Clinton false flag and the planning has been going on since that town hall when this kid asked to stage question

    | text      = Given the things that Kanye has been saying, I don't think I would want to be taking credit for waking him up. Nor would I want to say that my audience is responsible for it. I understand the short term gains that you can get from Cloud chasing here, but considering what Alex is saying he should know what he's associating himself with. Alex is clearly running cover for Kanye is anti semitic Instagram post here by implying that the Tucker interview and the white lives matter shirt is the reason that he's kicked off the platform. Instead of Kanye posting private messages between him and Diddy, where he threatens to use him as an example to the Jewish people who told Diddy to contact him. Alex knows what he's doing. Kanye is useful in terms of giving the appearance of not being racist while simultaneously using his celebrity to push dumb extreme right wing politics to a different audience. And Alex knows that comes with the byproduct of spreading intense anti semitic ideas to that wide audience and promoting them to your own audience at least tacitly, and Alex doesn't care at all. This is probably at least partially due to the fact that Alex's ideology is underpinned by pretty similar anti semitic ideas. Now, as for Candace Owens, Alex can claim that he woke her up but she's been very public about her experience moving to the right and it's due to GamerGate. In high school, Candace received a settlement of over $37,000 When she sued the school board for failing to protect her from racist death threats and harassment. Coincidentally, Norm Panis, was her lawyer. In 2015 She started a website called degree one ad, where there was a blog full of anti Trump and anti Republican content. So, mom around that side. She followed this up in 2016 with a website called Social autopsy, which was supposed to be a site where online bullies would be unmasked and their anonymity was taken away. Everyone thought this was a terrible idea, and it would just lead to Daxing and targeted harassment. It's super easy to see the way that the site's concept could be used for evil, particularly when it's being run by someone with as flimsy principles as Owens. Zoe Quinn, the target of a lot of the GamerGate harassment apparently sent Oh into message warning her that this wasn't a good idea, and she was likely to become the target of harassment herself. If she followed through with this. Unsurprisingly, Owens did get start getting harassed and doxxed and she decided to create an evidence list conspiracy that Quinn wasn't warning her of the result of her terrible idea. She was actually threatening her that if she made this website Quinn would let loose team of online harassers. Wow. And just like that Candice Owens became a right wing con artist. She took on the name Red Pill black and then started working for turning point USA, which he continued to do until she made those comments back in 2018. About how Hitler would have been totally cool if you didn't have aspirations outside of Germany. So weird how these there's a high percentage of people Alex claims to have woken up who go on to do Nazi shit.

    | text      = So this is where Alex's stupid misreporting of stories becomes creating stories out of whole cloth. He doesn't understand the underlying story about Pay Pal and how this wasn't a fine, they were going to charge you it was related to fees that will be placed in your account if you're sued for crimes that involve the platform. Because Alex doesn't understand the underlying story here. And just as a loose grip on the headline, he's read on like a right wing blog, he thinks that Pay Pal is going to find you $2,500 If you write a post on your blog that says that climate change isn't real. Now this introduces a problem. How is PayPal going to know that you're blogging about unapproved things so they can find you. In order to accept the inaccurate and incorrect version of this story, there needs to be some mechanism in place for it to even work logistically. So Alex has written that part of the story for the audience pulled straight from his imagination. Consider how stupid all of this is, if you believe Alex's version, Pay Pal would have needed to set up a super expensive part AI Park manual system to monitor all of its users behavior off site to see if they're doing anything that they could get them find that would require spying on like 400 million people, which would be really expensive, it'd be expensive to operate but the infrastructure to do it would also take millions upon millions of dollars to set up. So the sink all that money in knowing that they're going to be able to recoup their losses with this fine system. You know, they're gonna start raking in that sense of censorship cash, but then oh, no, what's this? The right wing media is complaining about the terms of service. And just like that years of investment and implementation of a worldwide censorship AI system has to be thrown out and the terms of service just go back to normal. This is legitimately what's implied by Alex's narrative. This is what you have to accept whether you realize it or not, in order to take on Alex's version of the story, which is inaccurate because he didn't actually read the story or look into this at all, and he's just making shit up. On the fly to freak out the listeners
