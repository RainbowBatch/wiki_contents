I mean, one of the things that's really nice is like going through and, you know, addressing the envelopes and stuff. I see a lot of names that are like people from way back. Yeah, you know, and it's really nice to know that these people like a lot of people are still with us. You know, that's that's really exciting.

Bought a like zoo, second tier football club in Wrexham, in Wales, which is like the oldest it's i It's really cool story about the backstory of the town. And it's got the oldest International Stadium anywhere and all this cool stuff. And then they turn them into like the Mighty Ducks. Right, and that's really cool. But then because Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are rich as shit, and they can get all these sponsorship deals. Now they're in a league where they are getting a huge budget compared to everybody else. So they're like the bad guys. But at the same time, because of the way football works. They're in a lower league. So what they're really trying to do is get out of that league to be the underdog in the higher League. You know what I'm saying? So they're still an underdog, right? But there's they're an overdog underdog kind of situation. And it's really cool because it talks about the town, which is more interesting. That's

And then I've been needing another show because I you know, I've watched all the Survivors. So I need something to watch while I'm making the buttons and stuff. right, right. I sort of gravitate towards shows that are about people surviving. Because like, Survivor. well, yeah. And then I tried the Naked and Afraid but as I told you, yeah, there are plenty naked. Most of them are not that afraid. They're not that afraid. No, it kind of doesn't live up to the premise. So I found a show recently called Alone, and it's they are straight up alone.

Right, right. Alright. So I think that there's there's points that I want to make. And this is something I think, probably merits focus, okay. And we'll get to that in just a moment.

But it's crippling to Alex's argument. Yeah. A lot of that stuff is there. And then to the side of that all of the humanizing and the fleshing out of the people's experiences. They're the sort of discussion of their loved ones. Yep. Tough, tough. Tough To. To. Yeah, to wrestle with.

{{TranscriptBlock

Emotionally affecting powerful, and the way that they have all turned their lives into something. That is, I mean, just incredible. You know, it is it's something that's stronger than I think I could ever accomplish. You know, like it is that kind of thing.

    | text      = And God willing, you'll never have to find out. Absolutely. Yeah, it's just yeah, I words almost fail me in terms of the process of this. Last bit. Yep. And so we reached the end of the trial and the testimony and the closing arguments, and up with the plaintiff's lawyers laying out really concise argument about what they have discussed. There's, like the appeal to the emotions of the case scores, respect for that, but also the cause and effect of Alex's behavior and the grief that was caused to these people. And then norm Pattis, for the defense decides he's gonna play a 20 minute video of Alex from his own show. Yep. And I thought that was strange.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 14:22
    | text      = I mean, I heard him I mean, I watched the video and was like, focused on it, because for some reason, I thought there must be some sort of content reason that he would play this video. And when you watch it, you're like, I think he just didn't want to do 20 minutes of his closing argument.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 14:40
    | text      = I think it was Alex said, play this or your fired. Yeah, that could be That's my guess that could definitely be the case. So look, I understand that the whole argument that Alex and Norm have wanted to make this whole time is that the videos the plaintiffs are showing have been taken out of context and to understand what they're playing and what Alex says you need to watch the whole videos. So now in the closing statement, that's when Norm has this ability to do that. Yeah. But this is kind of bullshit because the exact same argument that they use applies here. This is just like a 19 minute video from a larger show. To understand the context of this video, shouldn't we insist that you have to watch the whole show. And to be honest, Alex's shows are generally emotional outbursts that are the result of some other stimulus. So in order to understand the whole show, you kind of need to watch the day before, you know the jury has got to see the day before show in order to put this in context, you can see how this argument spirals out of hand easily because it's meaningless. Alex defends himself by saying that things are out of context, and you need to see the whole clip because he wants to be able to set the arbitrary parameter for what you need to see in order to be qualified to judge him. It's bullshit. Yeah, also, there's at least one edit in the video that norm plays so even that doesn't even hold up.

    | text      = And and not just that, but what Norm did in his closing argument, I felt like was essentially flout every rule that had been made so far. Yep, up to that point. The video had like five claims that you could not make in that courtroom. We'll get to that it was insane. And Norm had at least six or seven out and out lies that I know he knows aren't true. Like physically speaking in the world we inhabit, I know Norm Pattis knows that this is not true. And he's saying it in front of a fucking judge. Yeah, you know,

Beyond sounding completely insane. rambling about how Meghan Kelly totally wanted to fuck him, and he could prove it if he was recording at the right time. Yep. Beyond that. Alex also touches on a number of fucked up claims. One, he says that it's proven that the WikiLeaks releases couldn't have been hacked, and were the result of someone on site downloading the files. This is part of his Seth Rich conspiracies, and it's based on comments made by his buddy William Binney. It was shown to Binney that he was totally wrong and that the documents could have easily been downloaded remotely, and Binney recanted his claim, but Alex has never corrected himself or updated his talking points. So just off the bat in this closing statement, Alex is reaffirming his belief that Hillary Clinton had Seth Rich killed for releasing the WikiLeaks, which Seth Rich's family has successfully sued people for claiming

In this clip, Alex says that he got a cease and desist slash retraction request about Sandy Hook that gave him a month to act. And he didn't because he felt like he hadn't done anything wrong.

He's playing this video, because the underlying point he's trying to make is that he's totally cool did nothing wrong, and the media is attacking him about Sandy Hook because he exposes things that the media doesn't want the public to know. Like how Assad is super cool, right? The thing is, though, that he makes no sense. Alex thinks that if people could just see him lay out his defense than they would get it and he'll be game over for the plaintiffs. But this video is uncompelling to anyone who doesn't already believe Alex's shit. It's particularly useless to show people who have already seen evidence that the things he's saying in this video are bullshit, as the jury already has. I get the impulse on Alex's part, I think but in this setting, it actually kind of makes his image look much worse.

    | text      = So you have to play this troubling clip full of bullshit well, so Alex is used to facing no consequences, being surrounded by losers on his payroll, who know they're unemployable anywhere else, interviewing con artists who are financially and professionally invested in maintaining the illusion that Alex is right, and being able to hang up on or bully any callers who disagree with him in any meaningful way. Yeah, he's used to his explanations for things working because the people he's explaining things to are already in his camp, to uninitiated ears or to people who've seen evidence to the contrary, this video just seems insane. He's a crazy person. What would have been useful for Norm to do would be to take the clips of Alex saying that Sandy Hook was fake with actors that were played in court and then show the full video that the clip claimed from which would then reveal that the original clip was taken out of context. And Alex was actually just asking questions or playing devil's advocate, right? He absolutely can't do that, though. Because those clips aren't out of context. That's a problem. All Norm can do is insinuate that the larger context completely absolves Alex, but it's bullshit. Yep. Norm's other arguments seem to be that Alex's actions were driven by a fear that the government was going to take the guns not by a desire to endanger grieving parents for money. But the reality is that Alex endangered grieving parents in order to push his narrative surrounding the fears about the government taking guns, which is something he embellishes, exaggerates and sensationalizes in order to make money. It's not one thing or the other is Norm is pretending it's all part of a dynamic system that Alex uses. Norm understands this. He's been a guest on Alex's show numerous times. If you watch this, you kind of get the sense that Norm doesn't believe a goddamn word he's saying. It's just that there's no other real way to argue this and the bravado that he had about the families exaggerating their grief in his opening statement, probably, that's that that sort of cockiness isn't gonna play too well with a jury after days of hearing from said family members about the pain they've endured. Yeah, he tried to bring that exaggeration point back up, but you heard how much more apologetic and careful he was about it. As opposed to the sort of cocky swinging dick he had in the opening. he was trying, Norm was desperate to try and make this political in his closing, trying to shoehorn in references to Trump and getting shut down with objections along the way. He also tried to make a mockery of the idea that the plaintiffs who testified and said that they didn't know what Alex's positions on guns, were. They, they didn't know what his position and tried to mock this. And I want to touch on this for a second. When you live by the sword, it's not a certainty that you're going to die by the sword. But if you do, you have an obligation to accept your death by the sword. Alex's most consistent defense of himself is that he's being taken out of context, and that you can't understand what he's saying from short clips. I think this is bullshit. But it's the foundation of Norm's defense and their position. So he has to accept this. It's all good fun for him when he wants to claim that Alex mocking Robbie Parker was out of context. But it's so weird how he doesn't realize that this cuts both ways. He can show the jury a clip of Alex saying they're coming for our guns or they're staging shootings to take our guns. And if he's being intellectually consistent, he should know that the jury can't possibly know what Alex's position on guns is without watching the whole video. In essence, Norm's underlying defense strategy precludes him from being able to expect that he's able to prove anything. This is also a corollary of one of Alex's other defenses. When he's accused of anything and then shown video of him doing or saying the thing he's accused of he'll say it's out of context, or it's satire. If that is what Alex is saying, and if the entirety of his on air career isn't allowed to be shown in his custody hearing, because he's putting on a performance, then why should the plaintiffs in this case take him at his word when he says something on air? He could lay out his entire philosophy on gun succinctly on his show, and the plaintiffs would have every right to say that well, he did say things on air, they have no way of knowing what Alex's sincere positions are. Alex gets a lot of mileage out of people knowing he's a fraud and a liar where he can wiggle out of trouble by disowning the things he says on air as being theatrical or satire. But the other side of this is this: if you want Norm to insist that the Sandy Hook families are suing them because of their opposition to his position on guns, you have no right to claim that they even know what those positions are. This is called being hoisted on your own petard. there is that. this is you know, oh, you got to oh, you can't understand what I'm saying on air. You can't expect that you get to use that as the opposite for your own purposes. And it's just sad it was a very bad closing statement, disgraceful all around. Yeah. And fuck Norm.

That's why he went to Connecticut. He had no intention of ever testifying. But. Since the bankruptcy court has taken over his business's finances, I bet he had to pretend that he was going to testify in order to rationalize the expense of his travel. It would probably not fly as a business expense for a company in bankruptcy to say, hey, I want to go across the country with my shithead lawyer friend so I can promote my book on the steps of the courthouse where I'm avoiding testifying, because I'm scared. I bet the bankruptcy court would be like, yeah, no, I'm gonna go with.  that's not going to be an expense for ya

Find out what the establishment so scared of why my book is number one in the world, The Great Reset and the war of the world, because that's what I really cover. That's what I really do. I make money off of films and books. I never made a movie about Sandy Hook. I barely covered it. That's a lie.

He's doing this because even he knows that his real actions are indefensible. But if he lies about what he actually did, it becomes a little bit more understandable how he could make these mistakes and such. He's doing this because he's a coward and a liar. Yep.

You know, a lot of folks that are pro gun didn't like those families being political. I understand what the families did it. And so yes, nobody should harass the families.
