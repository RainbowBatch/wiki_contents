'''<nowiki/>'Major' Solomon Berg''' is a [[Project Camelot]] Guest (and Knowledge Fight Listener) who seems to be trying to trick [[Kerry Cassidy]] and her audience into adopting a less bigoted worldview. This is definitely not his real name.

Berg first appears on Project Camelot in [[698: For Squatch, There Are No Heroes|Episode 698]] where he spun a yarn about escorting a Sasquatch Alien out of the US in a sort of Free-Willy escape story. During that appearance, he dropped a number of hints that he was a Knowledge fight listener, including referencing an assistant named "Major Daniel Jordan", and using a shibboleth previously placed by Dan and Jordan for if [[Mark Richards]] was a listener. Despite these references, Dan was unsure if Berg was a listener at the time of taping. 

Berg made another appearance (covered in [[721: September 2, 2022|Episode 721]]) where he tried to broaden his mythology and discuss the history of Mars. In this Episode, Dan stated that it was now clear to him that Berg was in fact a listener. He decided to continue to cover his appearances because he believes that Berg's project is not a mean-spirited prank and because Knowledge Fight is already "in too deep" after loving Squatch so much.
