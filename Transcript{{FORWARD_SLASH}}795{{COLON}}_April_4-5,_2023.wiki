Initially, when police arrived at the scene, they arrested and charged both of them with assault and attempted murder. However, upon review of the evidence and getting a handle on what the situation was, Alvin Bragg's da office dropped the charges against era. This was two days before the point where Alex is lying on air about this because he doesn't know or care about the real story. He's probably just seeing a stupid meme on some far right. shithead social media, right? Alex doesn't get doesn't need to get this story, right? Because his version of it feels right to the audience out this fake version of the story conforms to the picture they emotionally resonate with about how their enemies work, and how rigged everything is against them.

There aren't armies of mind controlled patsies and they're never worried. This is a pretty narrow case about whether or not the US can be sued in a Canadian court for things that were done between the 40s and 60s in the MK Ultra experiments. Normally, states have sovereign immunity. And so if these people wanted to sue the US government, the appropriate place to do that would be in US courts. But in 1982, Canada passed the state Immunity Act, which is being argued that it allows people to sue a foreign government when there are cases of bodily injury involved. The question is whether or not this act is retroactive, whether it applies, and other various legal technicalities. I know that Alex's version is more fun and all but it only exists in his imagination. In reality, the only reason he's even doing this whole presentation is because he's fairly sure that one of his compatriots is likely to want to try to blow up a building or commit some other act of horrific domestic terrorism. So this is just further pre emptive damage control for that. In case it happens.

The first thing to keep in mind is that when people are talking about these statistics, they are not talking about suicide rates. They're talking about attempted suicide rates. death records don't include sexual orientation or gender identity typically, so With that gathering that information is not something that most of these studies have been able to capture. They deal with attempted suicides or you know, desire to attempt, which is important because that means that studies and surveys can capture the influences that led to that decision. Yeah, a 2020 study in the Journal of interpersonal violence found that micro aggressions and familial emotional neglect are two of the highest contributing factors, generally speaking, mean murderous pimps strangely didn't make an appearance in that study at all, not even not even close. Yeah, the Trevor Project has also done a ton of work in this field. And this is one of the things that's very consistent. Their 2022 survey found that if LGBTQ youth have a high level of familial support, their risk of attempting was more than cut in half. In addition to that familial support acceptance and support in schools are also important variables that are associated with decreased suicidality. Right? We would be remiss if we didn't also mention that this Trevor Project survey found that 60% of respondents wanted mental health care but did not receive it. There's a certain amount of this statistic that has nothing to do with someone being trans or non binary, but just with everyday mental health problems, that end up not being able to to be something they seek help for, often due to financial inability, or concerns that parents won't give their permission to seek treatment, or even concerned that there'll be outed if they seek treatment. To the extent that trans folks are sex workers, some of them want to be in that field and good for them. Others feel they have no other viable options, which is not helped by the phenomenon of employment discrimination. Additionally, many LGBTQ folk resort to sex work because they're kicked out of their homes by unaccepting parents and find themselves on the street. In many ways, a lot of the roads go back to the impact that having supportive, accepting family members has and the negative impact that not having that has, I know that Alex has no idea what he's talking about, and he's just making shit up as he goes along. But I do think that he knows what he's doing, namely, preaching a gospel that's designed to make more parents less accepting of their LGBTQ children, thereby exacerbating the very problem he pretends that he's not making worse. Yeah,

    | text      = They make a good point. Yeah, so Alex is still lying about the parking attendant story. I say lying even though he probably has no idea what the reality is because I know that even if he heard that the charges had been dropped, he'd still tell his audience the same story. Yeah, it doesn't matter. It satisfies what it needs to satisfy. Yeah, which is the emotional needs of the audience. As for the sex fiend case, is a little bit more of a mess. The situation is this man named Justin Washington was offered a plea deal where he would get 30 days in jail and five years probation on a rape charge being pled down to a charge of coercion. A spokesperson for the DHS office said that they had consulted with sex crimes, prosecutors who had been in contact with the victim and their family, and that the plea deal was partially in service of finding a way to hold Washington responsible that make it so the victim would not have to testify. The amount of evidence prosecutors had forced them to reduce the charges from first degree rape and first degree sexual abuse to third degree which dropped Washington's bail to $12,000 which was he was able to meet Okay, he had no prior arrests and made all court appearances so it doesn't seem that outlandish that he would be offered to be able to be released on bail. However, just a few days before he was set to be sentenced he went on an assault spree. This is pretty awful. Like it's ridiculous it was like climbing up people's fire escape masturbating looking in their windows and stuff. It was a man what the fuck yeah, it's awful. And naturally, the TAs office has moved to retract the plea deal. Alex and his ilk are pretty obsessed at the moment with D legitimizing Alvin Bragg and the Manhattan DA 's office. So whatever appearance of wrongdoing will be naturally blown out of proportion. But it's important to keep in mind that Alex doesn't care about at all about this parking attendant or any of Washington's victims. This is literally only an issue for Alex because it helps them make Trump look less guilty. For instance, to my knowledge, Alex has never spoken about Steven Broderick Broderick was a Austin Travis County Sheriff's deputy who was charged in 2020 with sexually assaulting a child. While he was out on bond he committed a triple murder his victims, including his ex wife and his stepdaughter who was the victim in the sexual assault case. So I mean, like Da is offices, you know, right people, it's, it's not a situation that's unique to the Manhattan DA 's office. And it's definitely not just something that we should accept as an inevitability of life. But on the flip side, if people truly are innocent until proven guilty, it does not make sense to take someone with no prior convictions and deny them bail. The sweetheart deal that was offered to Washington wasn't related to as it wasn't related to the ability to commit further crimes. But that's the story how it needs to be told for Alex because he only needs the story to prompt to prop up the Trump as a victim narrative. Yeah, you don't I'm saying like he got out on bail. Yeah, it wasn't the sweetheart deal or whatever they that allowed that at the sweetheart deal wasn't what reduced his bail it was the lack of evidence. And and what

The only specific like I mentioned that Alex is even given is that Rachel Maddow said that she might not air it, which Alex has now turned into like a media blackout. Yeah, because Alex knows that he has no leg to stand on here. He pretends that the caller is denied that Trump was kicked off Facebook and Twitter, he has to put a position into the callers mouth that he can mock because he can't defend his own position. You notice that as soon as he pulled that maneuver, the next thing he did was does was hang up immediately and no more calls.

These people have campaigned on that. I guess the flip side could be like, yeah, in hindsight, it was bad for Trump to do that we should do a moral inventory on this check. Right? How we're doing right, right. That's either of those is one like, either get rid of your complaints about brag, or throw a complaint at Trump brand yourself for that. That's one way or the other way is to say, Yeah, with Hillary, it was real. Yeah, the crimes were real. In this case. It's not Yeah. And Alex, probably, I don't know why he wouldn't think to do that. It would be an easy because the crimes are real, who would be an easy dodge within his narratives, right and stuff, but it would open a second stage of like that now. Are you are you ready to defend that? Right. And somebody who may have a rebuttal, right? No, you are not? Nope. Nope.
