Today, Dan prepares Jordan for a discussion about Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones. He does this by discussing a very insane video Alex released on Friday, June 17, because it very clearly exposes Alex's mindset in the moments leading up to the release of the interview. Topics covered include:

*Are there "cows with human titties?"
*Does Alex think his ancestors literally talk to him?
*How long does Alex hope Megyn Kelly's kids live?
*Is Alex a professional impressionist?
