The thesis, insofar as the film has one, is that Obama is bad.  As might be expected, the documentary is a mess, both in terms of the content and the editing. Large portions are just recycled from [[Endgame]]. Knowledge Fight covered Endgame starting in Episode [[230A: Obama Deception, Part 1]].\"",
