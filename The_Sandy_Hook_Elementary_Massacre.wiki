'''Sandy Hook''' was a horrific mass shooting event that occurred on Friday December 14, 2012. It killed 26 people, 20 of whom were students aged 6-7, and 6 of whom were staff members of the school.

The specifics of the shooting are out of scope for this wiki. Please seek out reputable sources if you want details.

For our purposes, what matters is that the event absolutely did happen as generally reported, but [[Alex Jones]], his staff at [[InfoWars]], and a few other crackpots like [[Wolfgang Halbig]] and [[James Fetzer]]  decided that it was much more profitable to deny it ever happened and harass the parents of victims.

Jones in particular integrated a variety of beliefs about Sandy Hook into his mythology from 2012 until at least 2018 (when he was sued), and arguably has continued to deny Sandy Hook happened as reported until the present day.

At various times, Jones would claim various false and distressing things about the events. These ranged from assertions that the event either happened but was staged or perpetrated by government agents, all the way up to florid claims that Sandy Hook Elementary was not a school at the time, and no-one died there.

As of 2022, Mr. Jones has been found liable in [[Notable Legal Proceedings|numerous defamation cases]] brought by [[Sandy Hook Family Members|family members of Sandy Hook victims]].
