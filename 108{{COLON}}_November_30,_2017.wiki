Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened on the November 17th episode of The Alex Jones Show. This episode marks the first time we know of that Alex ends his show on a cliffhanger, but definitely not the first time he's spewed intensely ahistorical racist theories or used absurd arguments to defend horrible men.
