'''Mike Cernovich''' is a pile of garbage.

Mike found his first crumbs of success as a member of the Pick Up Artist community. As a self-styled Fuck Guru, Mike gave dudes incredibly fucked up advice, like "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160318163008/http://www.dangerandplay.com/2012/02/27/when-masturbation-leads-to-a-close/ when in doubt, whip it out]." He made a very smooth transition into being a figure in Gamergate, as it seemed like a novel new way for him to attack women and pretend it's politics. After this, Mike made his way to Trump and the Alt-Right because he was concerned about "[http://archive.is/JtEAY white genocide]".

After realizing that he was literally in bed with Nazis, he started pretending he wasn't "alt-right," but was "alt-light," as if there was a distinction.

Much like [[Paul Joseph Watson]], he's pretended to leave the [[Trump]] Train a few times, probably to cultivate the image of independence, only to come right back into the fold immediately. In Dec. 2017, Mike started trying to "report" on fraudulently created documents claiming to be sexual assault accusations against Chuck Schumer, indicating that he either was involved in the forgery or he was too bad a journalist to realize that they were terrible fakes and "reported" on them anyway.

He is literally too much of a monster to describe here, so check here if you want more of [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mike_Cernovich the Greatest Hits].
