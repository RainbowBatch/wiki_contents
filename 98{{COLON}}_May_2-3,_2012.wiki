Today, listener Alan has sent Dan and Jordan on a fact-finding mission going back to May 2012 to see what [[Alex Jones]] was up to back then. The goal was to learn about the spin on the death of [[Osama Bin Laden]], but instead what they find are so many lies about FEMA camps, using cash being illegal, and "the death of the Chicken Man"
