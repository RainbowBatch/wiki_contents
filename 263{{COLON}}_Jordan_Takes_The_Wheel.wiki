Today, Dan and Jordan switch roles on the show, to see how that feels. Jordan is very passionate about climate change, so for his episode he decided to find a particularly distasteful climate denier to go over. Also, Dan seems to have a lot of possibly inaccurate thoughts about music when he doesn't have to prepare for an episode.
