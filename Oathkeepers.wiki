The '''Oathkeepers''' are a gang closely involved with a number of domestic terrorism incidents in the US, including the Bundy Ranch standoff, Sugar Pine Mine standoff, Malheur Wildlife standoff (although national and local chapters have disagreed about their involvement in these events), and January 6th, where Oathkeepers infamously stashed weapons for a "Quick Reaction Force" and moved in formation into the Capitol Building<ref>https://apnews.com/article/oath-keepers-founder-jan-6-trial-4372b311695c401255c6881111ff4f41</ref><ref>https://rop.org/uia/section-i/appendix-response-malheur-occupation/</ref><ref>https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry/the-road-to-capitol-went-through-bundy-ranch/</ref>.
