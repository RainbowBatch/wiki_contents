Today, Dan and Jordan discuss the March 6-8, 2009 episodes of the Alex Jones Show. Alex is coming off the big reveal of his bogus Avian Flu narrative, and that absolutely continues. In these episodes, Alex seems preoccupied with really bad examples of gun people who have been arrested, as well as a deeply over-simplified take on a profoundly tragic piece of American history.
