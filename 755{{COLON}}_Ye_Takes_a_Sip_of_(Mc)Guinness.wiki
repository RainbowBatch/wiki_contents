Today, Dan and Jordan continue to track the ongoing political campaign of Ye, and how it relates to Alex Jones and his career.  In this installment, another right-wing fraud attempts to sanitize Ye's bigotry, Alex formally responds to the aftermath of his interview, and Nick Fuentes calls Alex out about how his formal response is nonsense.
