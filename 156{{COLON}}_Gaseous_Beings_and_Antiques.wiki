Today, Dan tells Jordan all about how Kerry Cassidy of Project Camelot just posted her newest discussion of an interview she conducted with Mark Richards. Depending on who you ask, Mark Richards either is a crazy person who orchestrated a murder in 1984, or he is a Secret Space Captain who was framed because his friendship with Raptor Aliens makes him too dangerous to the New World Order. Whatever you may believe, the new information we learn today is potentially earth-shaking.
