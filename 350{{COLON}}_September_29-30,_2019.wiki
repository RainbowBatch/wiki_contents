Today, Dan and Jordan check in with [[Alex Jones]] in the present day and see how he's taking the news that [[Donald Trump|Trump]] tweeted about a hypothetical civil war. How does Alex balance telling his audience that an actual civil war is inevitable with his calling his audience to "legal and lawful" action? Poorly, it turns out.
