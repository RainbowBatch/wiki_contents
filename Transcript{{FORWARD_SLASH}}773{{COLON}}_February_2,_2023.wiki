So something that's an element of my current life that I could never have predicted me or five years ago is that I'm frequently in a position where I know a lot more than I can reveal. I feel privileged that I've achieved some kind of a place in this world. And I always go out of my way to respect privacy and non disclosure. For example, I flew to Austin to sit in on the Alex and Daria depositions in early December 2021. And no one other than a few private friends knew that happened. It delayed January 2022. When we covered it on the depositions on the podcast wherever they were released, driving friends, and then me too sure, yeah, businesses. For two months, we gave no indication that I'd taken a trip across the country and was in the same room as Alex himself. At that time, I knew that Daria had said that spreading conspiracies that Sandy Hook victims are still alive might be a generous act and could provide the parents with some hope. I knew that you can't imagine how hard it was for me not to talk about

And, you know, still you didn't I say all this as an intro to explaining that I've known this SPLC article was gonna come out for past couple months. Yeah, I'd wrestled with how it was gonna address this when it did come out. And I feel like the only way to navigate this is to be as transparent as I can be, and give some sincere opinions. I've also reviewed all the texts, and I have a lot of thoughts about them, which we can start to get into now a little bit. When I first reviewed them, which I did as a part of my role as the consulting expert in the Heslin Lewis case, it really hurt. I approached the prospect of this level of access to Insight information to be a gold mine and I reveled in what I might learn about this con man that I've studied for years. And I would be lying if I said that there wasn't some level of giddiness. In me as I look, oh, my God. Yeah, as I read through them, so much of it is pretty personal stuff, and it really fucking bummed me out. For one, it validated a portrait of Alex that it's pretty obvious if you listen to his show critically at all. And it was a little deflating to realize that he's basically as much of a mope as he seems to be. But even beyond that, there's some real pathos and complicated feelings that come up when you peek into the inner workings of a monster's life. And that's the work for biographers, which I'm not at this point, not yet. After reviewing the text, it became difficult for me to do my normal work for a bit. I've always tried to make an exercise of practicing abstract empathy for Alex in as much as it's important to recognize his personhood.

Yeah, the feelings of I'm not gonna get into specifics or details. Sure. Nor could I really, at this point, even from memory, but when I was reviewing the texts, these are some of the emotions that I had. Yeah. That said, there are some pretty newsworthy things in this tranche of texts, just probably not the things that the public expects are going to be rare. There's a certain hype surrounding the specter of Alex's mysterious revealed text, like people think the Deathstar blueprint is going to be in there. And they're going to be disappointed if they think that

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:12:23.000
    | text      = is good news all over the place of Scooby Doo. However, there are things that I'm excited to be able to talk about, because they do directly intersect with our work. As a courtesy to everyone involved. I'm not going to talk about any of those things until the SPLC does or until their series is over, because I do think that they're going to get to them in later installments. So full disclosure, I was initially involved in that project as a third party along with Michael and Megan, yes, I was approached under the understanding that the project would not be about Alex's personal life, and would focus on some of the more important Though admittedly less attention grabbing aspects of information in the texts. Over the course of my time working on the project, it didn't feel like this was the direction that things were going, and I decided to quit on January 4. There are many aspects of this that I'm not going to discuss and will remain private. But I ultimately didn't feel like this was something I cannot disclose right in good conscience. Of course, this is a gigantic story about Alex Jones, the person who I've studied and commented on for the past six years, so ignoring it doesn't feel like an option, and covering it well, not revealing my involvement also feels like it would be lying to the audience, even if only by omission. on a fundamental level, my disagreement with the piece was that it as it was planned, which is reflected in the form it's been released, and is the rumination on Alex's private life in ways that I don't feel are productive, or even at times are self defeating. I'd like to go through a couple of these dynamics in detail to explain my Yeah, of course, one of the topics that's covered in great detail in the article is the subject of Alex's marriage and the rockiness that the texts imply, no matter what you do, you will never get an accurate picture of someone's personal relationship with someone they're in an intimate relationship with from an incomplete series of text messages. And it's my feeling that you shouldn't try. I'm not saying that the stuff in there should just be ignored, because there's clear indications that Alex seems to be engaging in really destructive behavior, like what appears to be stalking, and that's a serious matter. I just don't know if it's a matter of primary importance to a piece about him and it'd be more relevant to law enforcement, quite frankly, than the reading audience. There's another issue that the dipping into this territory introduces and that's a matter of completeness, I can see that the picture that's painted in the article is fair in as much as it reflects the texts. But it also doesn't include a ton of other context from texts. There's a selectiveness to what's being covered, which is always going to be an angle for possible criticism by someone like Alex when you're addressing his personal life. Right Case in point the SPLC article, it says that Alex's wife mentions that they Should get divorced six times and the text which is true, but the texts also include Alex saying that multiple times himself, when you introduce the notion that she wanted a divorce at times, it becomes an omission to not also mention that he did. They have a chaotic rocky relationship that much is true for sure based on the picture you get. But they also send each other sweet messages and have clearly inside jokes that none of us could possibly understand. It was my personal opinion that it's possible to understand and recognize that Alex is most likely a very abusive asshole. And also think that it's really shitty to publish messages where the only news value is to demonstrate that a married couple are probably cheating on each other and have fights. The second matter is the alcoholism. This is an interesting question, because it straddles the line between things that are already pretty public and things that are really sad and private. Alex is already very obviously a person who struggles with drinking, he said as much on air, he's been on air very drunk way more than once. He's claimed that he was drunk on air when he defamed Sandy Hook families, and that video surveillance of him drinking at the office was leaked a few months back. I think that this is a case where it does seem relevant that Alex is having people fetch him vodka during the time when he's on air, often before noon. But here's the twist. I checked the shows from the days where in the texts where he's requesting booze, he seems totally normal. Those aren't days where he was clearly drunk or having huge outbursts on air. And I thought that was pretty weird. I thought, like, for sure. Here's where we find a drunk episode was probably drunk, but he was just maintaining or whatever they you

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:16:42.000
    | text      = but nothing happened on the show. See, he's drunk, but he's drunk in the way like maybe someone who just needs to fix his context might work. I feel like the conversation about his arrest for driving impaired and the way that alcohol intersects with what he puts out into the world is totally fine. And some of the texts really do help illustrate that. The problem is that this problem with alcohol extends into his personal life. So if you're covering his personal life, it's pretty difficult to disaggregate that from the conversation. I don't know how to do this. And I don't necessarily think the argument cold does a terrible job. But at times, it's it's hard not to feel like you're wallowing in Alex's misery, and I don't know if that's necessary. It made me feel uncomfortable. The last thing I want to touch on is the pornography section, which was the reason I left the project. It was an impasse that we couldn't get around and I felt that I couldn't be involved. Alex sending his wife porn links while being a public opponent of porn is pretty hypocritical. But there's also nothing wrong with sending your spouse links to porno that they're clearly fine with receiving. The problem is the on show message and the illustration that the messenger doesn't live up to the prescription his message is sending doesn't help make that point. The fomenting conspiracies about pornography and demonizing sex workers is the problem sending porn privately is not by connecting these two things and making a critique that appears to hinge on that hypocrisy. It does seem to imply that if Alex didn't send his wife porn, he'd be in good standing to make the arguments that he does. And I don't buy into that. I can understand critiques that this is newsworthy, and I disagree, but we can agree to disagree on this. On the other hand, the rest of that section is unacceptable for me. The final paragraph is a clear attempt to imply that Alex is bisexual or has bisexual leanings. For anyone who hasn't read the article. I will just read you that paragraph. Quote, the text hate watch reviewed further reinforced the likelihood that the Infowars host demonstrates different views on sexuality in his personal life than he professes on his notoriously bigoted show. In addition to viewing pornographic material involving group sex, his wife is sending Jones a picture of a black man's erection in the texts. There are no women in the photo. Jones and his wife also exchanged messages expressing favorable view of views about bisexuality. On February 1 2020, Erica wolf Jones texts her husband up by it was and is my opinion that the source material doesn't justify this coverage, view and group sex related porno doesn't update your sexuality at all. And the texts referenced by the about him and his wife could easily be inside jokes. Sending a picture of a dick doesn't mean anything and they fight so much that discerning the context is impossible, as his wife does say up by but who knows what that means. And it comes in response to Alex telling her you be Hoh. The language and the up construction makes me strongly suspect that this is an inside joke between married people. Further context from the text supports this as another point. His wife says I'm a bisexual elf followed by an emoji that looks like a superhero with a mask. She's clearly not saying this sincerely since she's responding to Alex texting an article from daily wire about Mark Ronson identifying as a POC She will she is

    | text      = Yes, they're making fun of Mark Robinson's identity. And I wouldn't be too surprised if the UB by has something similar to it. But from the material that exists, you can't possibly know the context of any of this. It's my belief that this kind of coverage is not just sloppy, it's also dangerous. At best, you could say that the article is trying to plant a seed that while Alex is anti LGBTQ on air, he's bisexual off air. This again runs into the problem that I mentioned earlier, where being bisexual is completely fine. And his on air positions aren't made any better or worse, based on his attractions. I don't know what Alex's sexuality is or what he's into. And to be perfectly honest, I don't care. That's his business. And I don't think I understand it any better from having reviewed the texts, I have a very strongly held belief that this doesn't need to be in the article nor any piece that's meant to be critical of Alex, if you're producing something that is critical of Alex, the best case scenario that you could be hoping for is to inform people about him. And that new awareness diminishes their respect for him. If you're going to get anyone who likes Alex to have second thoughts about him based on this, you're not actually helping, you're getting them to direct their homophobia at Alex. In addition to everyone else, you're also not informing non Infowars supporting people because this argument is based on such flimsy evidence that it doesn't support its own weight, you're liable to get people jumping to the assumption that Alex is secretly gay or bi. And you run to the you run the risk of feeding into the trope that homophobes are just secretly angry about themselves being gay. In the process, you weaken the actual criticism of Alex's rhetoric, which doesn't need to touch on his personal life to demolish and to have a strong critique of people can have different feelings about my perspective on that. But we do need to stress that the basis for this paragraphs inclusion in the article is not solid. And I understand that the article didn't actually claim that Alex was by but I think everyone here is an adult, and we recognize the clear implication, and people on Twitter certainly did. And in the comment section of articles about this, you can get the sense. Here's just a couple of you can find very easily on media Eitz article about this. The frogs turned me by Alex Jones. Alex Jones was Alex Jones. Being in two black guys wasn't on my 2023 Bingo card, and a ton of variations of that same joke. When's Jones gonna elope with Santos? People got the message. This problem is clearly never was never going to be manageable because the second installment of this article includes Jacob Engels, who's a proud boy who is an associate of Roger stones, and he is unnecessarily identified as a gay man three times in the article, presumably to justify this paragraph, quote, angles addressed revelations about Alex Jones his personal life that appeared in part one of this series saying, quote, I don't think there's anything wrong with being a red blooded American male. That's what Alex is about how he navigates the far right as a gay man angles said, quote, I try to live my life very quietly when it comes to my sexuality. I tried to keep that to myself, and not hoist that upon others. I they were able to reach angles and get common from them. And presumably one of the questions they asked him was about Alex's sexuality, which is a strong indication about the interest and the direction of that coverage. Again, this question was being posed to angles. It's predicated on some porn licks, links, a picture of a dick and almost certainly a joke between Alex and his wife. So I wanted to I know maybe that was too much, but Oh, not at all. I wanted to again, you

There's going to be that question asked, and so I feel like it'd be lying for me to say no, I didn't I wasn't involved at all right. And so I say, yes. Why aren't you on the article? That introduces that new question. And so I quit. That is the answer to that. Why did you quit? Right? And I wanted to be as transparent as possible without, you know, impugning people at the SPLC or being like, Oh, this is all fucking bullshit. Absolutely. Like that is a that is an impasse. For me. That was something that we did not see eye to eye on. I still definitely don't think was appropriate. I was not really involved in the second article. Maybe a tiny bit. I wasn't I wasn't around when drafts of that were writing. Right. So I my involvement sort of ended with and I do have the utmost faith that they are going to cover more relevant things and more substantial things that aren't just his personal life check in later installments. But I wrestled and struggled with, do I take my name off the first one and then try to stay involved in the other ones? Right? What message does that send? Right? Can I still be involved? And sort of extricate myself? And I felt like I couldn't. I felt like I couldn't get around that. Yeah. And I also felt like it would be something that would, the audience, maybe quite rightly, would have concerns about me being someone who has been fairly against covering Alex's Personal life In the past, we do our best to avoid unnecessarily bringing up stuff that is kind of like add it's not not. Yeah, it's, I felt like the audience might feel betrayed by that. And I think that would be fair of them to feel. Yeah. And so I don't know, this is tough.

Everything's been ready for months, I've just been so busy dealing with a bunch of other stuff that I have not done the things I truly love. And I'm passionate about because you're gonna hear me telling you, because I'm an idiot compared to my dad, or my grandfather. My mom's dad was still in your red bubble to do all this stuff. But I mean, I just think about the men I knew that are almost all dead. And they could literally do plumbing do electricity to roofing starts with a god great farmers. And they can read your bedtime stories and take care of your sick. And I think about those type of people. And I see what we got today, including myself, and I'm ashamed of what a stupid slob I become, and how I've let myself be positioned in this and how I raised my children in an evil city. Now that said, it's all in hindsight, and my children have done all right. When you know you're wrong, turns out no big deal. You gotta get out not gonna cause the problem here with the crew who I love this infrastructure stuck. With Austin, we got to move to something leaner and meaner with the crew. But I gotta get out of here right to high end. And, folks, you are insane. And you stay in the cities. I'm not saying just run the middle of nowhere either. But you got to find those communities and if you're willing to work with those communities are willing to work with you. And I'm telling you this is the whole future. And when a community knows they're under attack, and if you get people in the city council in those towns that know what's going on, we are unstoppable the New World Order is able to come shut down our towns. We will have our own hydro electric we will have our own gas power. We will have our own solar we will work together we're designed to do this and be self sufficient.
