Today, Dan and Jordan deplatform Alex Jones from their podcast as punishment for him being a huge disappointment. Instead of talking about him, they check in on what Sweary Kerry at Project Camelot has been saying about how things are going with the coronavirus. It turns out nothing might be real, and we may have some side-concerns that the CDC is definitely not equipped to handle.
