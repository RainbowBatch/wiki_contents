What follows are the resources that were used as reference in our coverage of Alex Jones' 2009 "documentary" The Obama Deception.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/research/2018/11/18/obama-deception-citations Obama Deception Citations]</ref>

On a fundamental level, most of the worldview that is expressed by Alex Jones' voice-over, and that of his main "expert" Webster Tarpley is traceable to W. Cleon Skousen's 1970 book The Naked Capitalist. That book was a complete misrepresentation of Carroll Quigley's work, particularly his books The Tragedy of Hope, and The Anglo-American Establishment. If you would like to hear Quigley's take on Skousen's work, and how he trafficked in misrepresentations, [http://www.carrollquigley.net/pdf/Round%20Table%20Review.pdf you can find a basic example here].

This explains a good deal of the historical revisionism in the film, so it felt appropriate to bring that up at the start.
