So I did a little bit of research into that. Do you mean like a syndicated like house? Okay. And I found that there was a listing from the Genesis communications network, they had a listing of the 83 stations that Alex Jones is broadcast on daily, and he's broadcasts on Sundays alone on 35 stations. But most of that is overlap. Like the Sunday broadcasts overlap with the 83. It's not 100%. But there's a lot of it. Gotcha. So I was looking at that, and I was

Hannity has at least 424 stations Glenn Beck has 327 Michael Savage has 223 stations nationally, Russia has 531. So I was like, Oh, he's at the bottom of that list. But then I started to look a little bit further. Oh, God. Yes. And I was like, What are these stations? Let me list off a couple of these stations that he has indicated. Oh, please. W S v. G. 790. Am out of Mount Jackson, Virginia. Population of 2000. Okay. W LS C 12:40am. Out of Loris, South Carolina population of 2000. He has two stations that broadcast I mean Kane, Pennsylvania population of 3500 people, two stations in that in Kane, Pennsylvania. W wi P V one. Oh 6.3 FM OUT OF HONOR way, Michigan population of 850. I've done I did some digging, did some math 36. Out of the 83 stations, that's 43% of the markets are not even ranked in terms of broadcast markets. Wow. So that's 43% or below the threshold where they would even make the consideration of rankings, right. 19 out of the 83. That's 22% are in the top 100 markets. That's okay. 22% in the top 100. Yeah, no, I mean, but I should say that most of them skewed towards the lower end of the top 100. Wow,

Okay, only 26 Out of the 83 including that 19 And the top 100 to bring them together to total 31% are in the top 150 markets. Okay? So if you if you keep going down you see that like a lot of these are bad.

I think I think that he's probably if you include YouTube in there, too. I think he has a bigger audience. Okay. But if you're talking about like, I mean, it's monetizing YouTube is incredibly difficult, right? And the amount that you get is not very high.

That's why without ratings Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I also did some research, I'm like, at three stations seems fucking low, what's going on there.

They don't charge you anything. And I quote, the Alex Jones Show overdrive and Infowars nightly news are free to air. There is no cost for running the program. No affiliate fees. That's in the contract. Wow. Now here's what they ask. Free Speech systems reserves the usage of three minutes per broadcast hour for network promotional advertiser space, the broadcaster will have usage of the remainder of the scheduled advertising per program.
