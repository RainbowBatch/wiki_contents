'''Steve Quayle''' is an unhinged lunatic, and someone who [[Alex Jones]] looks to as a very seriously credible source. [http://www.stevequayle.com/index.php?s=26 He has written books] about how there used to be literal giants walking the Earth, how the Nazis didn't lose WWII and actually have a base under Antarctica, how most natural disasters are really weather weapons, among many other insane topics.

Alex made clear on another episode that Steve is the source for most of his "chimera narratives," which is really sad.
