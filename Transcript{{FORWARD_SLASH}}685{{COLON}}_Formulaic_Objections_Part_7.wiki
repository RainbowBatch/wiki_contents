Having made embarrassing fumbles with Rob do and Daria Carpo via and having been sanctioned for how ill prepared they'd been to fulfill their job If the company had contracted somebody from the outside of the team to take on the job, that person was Brittany pas, a lawyer who's worked with Norm Pattis. In the past, she had a nearly impossible task in front of her getting up to speed on the topics that she was expected to be able to discuss. But at the end of the day, she did accept the job. That was impossible, right, and was paid $30,000 for it and became responsible for being a competent corporate representative. She that's what she took on her player, she could have not done that, given the impossible nature of the job, right.

No, no, she, I think, would look down upon the printing out of Wikipedia articles and similar behavior. So after that disaster, that was darias deposition, the judge in the Sandy Hook case had dealt with just about enough bullshit, she gave free speech systems, one last chance to provide a corporate representative and laid out some very specific guidelines about what this person was expected to do to prepare. So there could be no confusion when they sat down at this deposition chair, what you are expected, right? And the like, the judge was laying out these are the minimum requirements were right. This really was an act of generosity on the part of the court. This is the judge from that hearing, quote, I think where I'm struggling is actually I actually believe we're most likely to end up in a situation where I'm going to be telling the jury, we gave the defendants all these opportunities to answer these questions. And you may decide from the answers they gave or did not give that had they answered those answers would hurt their case, or some language to that effect. I just don't know that we're there today on these issues, after one shameful corporate rep deposition on damages. And so, you know, I would really like to have one corporate deposition where the witness actually prepares.

Naturally, these are long videos, and a lot of the information in them delves into areas that we've been over before. So I'm gonna try to trim a bit of an out and primarily focus on what we can learn from these documents. It's important to remember how much Alex wines on his show but not being allowed a chance to defend himself because this exists as definitive evidence that he's full of shit. He had already sent Daria to testify as a corporate rep. And she showed up with printed out Wikipedia articles having no idea about the subject she was supposed to discuss. And she ended up kind of supporting Sandy Hook conspiracy theories under oath. Yes, out of an abundance of grace, the court is giving him another chance to actually participate.

In the hearing. After Darrius deposition, the judge asked Alex's counsel, quote, do you know who will be designated or if there will be more than one person designated to respond to these topics? The response was, quote, I will have the answer for that by the end of today, and I'm relatively certain it will be more than one person. That would have been a good idea. And for whatever reason, Alex and free speech systems decided not to designate more than one person, they chose to leave this one person Brittany paws to be responsible for answering to all the questions in both of these cases, which honestly isn't fair. I don't have a ton of pity for Miss paws. But it would also be dishonest to not recognize that her inability to do her job in these depositions was part of an intentional choice that Alex made. If there's 10s of 1000s of pages of material to become familiar with having one person do that is an act of sabotage, especially when the opportunity was readily available to split the workload up between multiple representatives, sending one person with two weeks prep time is not an act of cooperation. That's, that's no good.

Um, I think that as far as social media goes, I think that the testimony previously has been that that information can prop that can be accessed through Twitter. Are you?

Here's what the judge said specifically about the responsibility that the corporate representative would have regarding matters involving preservation of evidence, quote, If she shows up again, or I'm sure we'll get a new, one new corporate representative, because that's the way this works. And that person says, I don't know, then they will have disregarded the orders I'm making today, your client will have violated the orders that I'm making today. I don't want I don't know, I'm guessing, I think maybe or I infer to be a part of the answer at all. So if the answer is we destroy everything as fast as we can, then I want them to come out and say that? And if their answer is we don't care where it comes from. So we don't ever create a record of they don't need to say that in that way. Alex's lawyer responded with just one word. Understood. Already, Miss pas has stepped in it. And it showed that the direct orders of the judge are not being followed, whether through negligence and on like unawareness on her part, or as a result of Alex's hostility to the process.

    | timestamp = 00:38:03.000
    | text      = so. So here we come to strike two in terms of this deposition, ignoring the direct instructions given by the judge, from the hearing, quote, the company's knowledge of the plaintiffs. Clearly, the representative who was sent did not even try to determine what the company news and she had no knowledge of documents that were provided by the company. She was their representative and the discovery of in these cases, so I consider it to be the minimum efforts or the corporate representative to review every document produced by the company in this litigation prior to their deposition. When Daria did her deposition, she had no awareness of documents that free speech systems had produced relating to their knowledge of the plaintiffs. And so as part of Alex getting another chance to provide a corporate rep, they were going to be required to review all the documents that involve this subject. As is painfully obvious from this exchange, Miss pas did not do that. This is clear specifically as it relates to Mr. Heslin. Because just as one example we have from prior depositions, the company produced an email that David Knight sent to himself with the subject line, quote, Connecticut carry releases the troubled past of Neil Heslin. From before the lawsuit. There was also that email that David Knight sent himself with the subject line quote, Neil Heslin, father of Sandy Hook, victim phases, criminal charges, which he sent to himself one night at three in the morning, before the lawsuits, we already have a concrete demonstration that two of the judges specific demands have not been respected. And we are not very far into this thing. No, it is just clear. And yeah, I don't know. It's, it's,

It's something that people could have different opinions on depending on your interpretation. And then after going aways down that road, she learns that it's actually a charity about fostering emotional intelligence and young students, then she was forced to stick with that premise that she's already established. And now she's left with an unfortunate and uncomfortable decision. She can either admit that she had no idea what she was talking about, and was making up assessments that she made earlier, or she has to stick to her guns and imply that this charity that's about teaching the core values of like kindness and forgiveness is secretly a gun control front that Ms. Lewis is being dishonest about, right?

He was working with Alex and free speech systems and a consultant type role financial consultant guy, but prior to that he had been working for PQ PR company that's basically owned by Alex's family with free speech systems O's $50 million, or whatever.

In these cases, the egregious pneus and repetitiveness of defendants obstruction exhibits a disregard for and disrespect of the integrity of this court and our judicial system. Plaintiffs discovery of facts necessary to properly present their claims for damages has been irreparably prejudiced in virtually all respects. Absent severe action from this court, defendants will ultimately profit from their sabotage of the discovery process. The court therefore orders that one, pursuant to rule 215. B. One, the court disallows any further discovery by defendants, any obligation of the plaintiffs to respond to any pending discovery is terminated.

Plaintiffs shall submit evidence setting forth any court costs, expenses or attorney's fees relating to discovery or discovery motions, accepting those amounts, which are already awarded in any prior order of the court, defendants may object to the amount within seven days after plantiffs filing. Right, so that was a lot of money. Yeah, that's a lot of money. Three, pursuant to rule 215. B three, the court orders that designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action. Specifically, the jury will be instructed that any factual dispute relating to the following topics shall be taken as established in favor of the plaintiffs. Sourcing and research for the videos described in plaintiffs petitions, individuals involved in the production of the videos described in plaintiffs petitions, internal editorial discussions regarding Infowars coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the company's knowledge of the plaintiffs, the audience reach of the videos described in plaintiffs petitions, the documents produced by the company in response to plaintiffs discovery requests, efforts made by the company to preserve potential evidence, and the company's business structure and relationship with other parties. Right. That's everything. Pretty much everything that the corporate representative testimony was right, designed to get like the deposition was meant to right.
