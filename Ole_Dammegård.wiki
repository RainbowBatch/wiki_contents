While Dammegard has plenty of credits in his bio (yoga, writing, music, films, interviews, speeches, et. al.) his main focus is on seeking the truth about the assassinations of JFK, Swedish Prime minister Olof Palme, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lennon, and Lady Di.  He also spends much of his time on 911, the Norwegian terror attacks, and the Oklahoma City bombing among others.

He has appeared on [[Project Camelot]] in the past.

In Episode #149 Dammegard is raised by an attendee of Alex's Press Conference.
