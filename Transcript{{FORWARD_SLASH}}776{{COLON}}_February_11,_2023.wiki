You study you sounds like a wedding. And then your first approximation is usually dead on right? The best shots I've ever made with a gun, that's why I don't try not to shoot here at 800 1000 yards, I just relax, pull back. This is an analogy of a famous shooting buddy, and fleas trigger. When the deer goes rolling head over heels or the wild hog, or whatever it is, I'm back when I have time to go hunting. And it's the same thing, I don't just go off half cocked. I don't just go off and do infidels deep research, I immerse myself constantly. And then nine times out of 10. When I just shoot from the hip, with what I originally think it is, the first approximation is usually right. And they want us to cut off our instincts cut off our common sense that we know is there. Another analogy is you've ever had somebody physically attack you, if you think about what you're doing, or you try to over become technical, that's when you decide to get somebody off of you. And is I'm gonna stop this person, it just happens right away, because you turn loose your instincts. But you've got to have the baseline of research and info for your synapses to access to make its decision. You don't have the big baseline, the foundation of research info history, I'm using fighting as an analogy. It's a primitive version of that, then you really can't be able to have that instinct and that instant analysis, but also do a lot of deep thinking and a lot of research and a lot of weighing of things politically, culturally.

There are phrases that he's just lifting whole cloth and the entire thing is really just an exercise in performative passion. Something that Alex's brand is reliant on. If you watch Matt, you can see the gears turning and the switch being flipped on. Maybe it's something that's just been built up in me from watching 1000s of open mic sets in my life. But the performance aspects of this are painfully transparent. At the beginning, when he's being all dramatic, and then the board asks him to identify himself.

If you paid close attention, you might notice that whenever you saw Matt, he was always wearing the same shirt, which is also the shirt that he's wearing on his Infowars appearance. It's a shirt with the Statue of Liberty wearing a mask that says slave on it. It should come as no surprise that he runs a shirt business called slave to Liberty selling these shirts among other weird conspiracy focused designs. I'm sure that Matt is mad about some of this stuff. And maybe he does believe that shit he's saying but he's also very clearly identified a shortcut to finding a place in the market. No one can stop you from speaking at these local meetings. And if you tape yourself doing some ridiculous Alex Jones impression rant, you stand a good chance of being shared widely within the far right media. If you suspiciously are wearing the same clothing item which you sell during each of these performances, you'll probably move a large number of them and get a pretty sweet payday for essentially doing nothing. From there. The next logical step is to transition into chasing whatever causes popular among the shitheads who loved your act, thus complaining about drag queen storytime and popping up in Maricopa County to yell about the midterms.

I'm sure a lot of right wing media love the image of Matt's video yelling at the local board meeting because they knew they could use it to inspire other people to sabotage local politics and intimidate folks. It was incredibly politically useful for them. But Matt himself isn't. No one in the actual media would see anything worthwhile in him. He's doing an Alex Jones impression rattling off Deep End conspiracy bullshit. He looks like the dirtiest form of hippie you can imagine. And he seems to be making bad parody songs on his free time, which is embarrassing. He neither has the information nor the personality that would make him an appealing person to get involved with.

The first is the idea that the globalists can essentially control all elections, and all elections are stolen to serve the whims of the power elite.

So there wasn't really a way to make this make sense if the globalist stole the election in his favor. Thus, the transition to a talking point where the globalists tried to steal the election, but Trump was just too popular, so he overcame the theft. I'll be the first to admit that that's pretty good save, but it's also a one time solution. If that truly is the case, then the globalists aren't going to let that happen again, because they learned from their mistakes. They're a scientific technocracy for fuck Supposedly, this presents a pretty large problem for 2024. But I think the audience is so uncritical that these thought leaders can easily just flash up a fake graph and say, amazingly, it was such a huge landslide that the steel didn't work again. Yeah. And people will buy it. Yeah. There will be people like Matt here, though, who are thinking this through a little bit. If our enemy is all powerful, and in control of the electoral system, doesn't that imply that whoever gets in is who they wanted to get in. If Trump wins again, that he must be the globalists choice. This will be a much bigger issue for Trump and DeSantis. Since DeSantis, hasn't been the subject of the we beat the odds to overcome the stolen election narrative once already. Sure.

Yeah, he wants to back DeSantis and does but there's the question of his backers. This is a great example of selective leak. Creating a problem, that expectation is that these candidates should be held responsible for who backs them, but they really want to support DeSantis and his backers are bad. Instead of sticking to the imaginary principle of judging a candidate by their backers, Matt is able to rationalize that you can call anyone bad by pointing to the bad people who financially support their candidacy. So maybe that's not a problem for DeSantis at all right? This should be a wake up moment for him that the criticism about backers isn't actually even something he cares about. Because if it were, it wouldn't be this easy to put aside. Further, it would be great if he could just think a little bit further down the line about the stolen elections and realize that this isn't a real thing either. And just exist as a narrative crutch to rationalize why supposedly super popular candidates end up losing and to D legitimize the electoral wins of candidates that extreme right wing folks don't want to accept, actually our popular. He's not going to do any of these things, though, because quieting that voice that could recognize that all this is bullshit is the surest path to not selling any more shirts. So you gotta gotta keep it up.

But more often than not, those shows are just covering bullshit that someone else posted on social media the day before. That's true. What Matt is saying is that to stay up to date on what's popular in the fringe, right wing media, it's really important to obsessively monitor social media so you can see the trends and how various conspiracies are performing. That way you can pick which ones are the best for you to adopt and champion and which don't really get people excited. Yeah,

And so the US troops could take out the tank fields and take out the the factories and everything. And the Russians didn't have that. So they lost 20 million troops.

Let's put it this way. When somebody goes into the doctor, and they say, you know, your blood sugar is too hot. To give them insulin to bring it? Yeah. Hey, when they say, you know, your blood pressure is too high. You're gonna have a heart attack. That gives them something to bring it? Yeah. When you have a son, and he's acting a little fruity. And you're like, Oh, this guy, maybe we should give him some more estrogen. Has it ever crossed anyone's mind that maybe there should be an actual hormone therapy because of all of the endocrine disruptors that are destroying the the gonads of the male to say if you have a fruity son, maybe he doesn't need hormone therapy. Maybe give him just a little taste of testosterone and see how he feels when he looks at a woman. Give him a little taste and see if he wants to be a little fussy sitting around taking crack

    | text      = Jesus. So leaving aside how stupid and offensive that is. It should be pointed out that these people like Alex and Matt clearly don't have an actual problem with hormone therapy. Their only actual complaint is that they want to restrict its use so it holds up their narrow and bigoted worldviews. If taken at face value. Matt isn't just talking about trans people here. He's also suggesting that if a parent suspect their son is gay, they should give him testosterone to make them like women. This even goes past a lot of the Info Wars style talking points where it's fair game to delegitimize trans existence. This is bordering on suggesting that being gay isn't even a real thing. It's just the gay men don't have enough testosterone. I guess lesbians don't have enough estrogen or something. I'm not entirely sure Matt doesn't elaborate on this point. Also, most hormone therapy is used to treat side effects of things like menopause and often is a part of cancer treatments. I wonder if Matt's worried about how one possible approach that you can take for prostate cancer is using CYP 17 inhibitors, which decrease your levels of androgen, you know, you might want to treat the cancer, but what if it makes you fruity in the process? These are not serious people. And their ideas don't deserve to be taken seriously. The only thing that's even real here is the damage that their political movement can do to members of the LGBTQ community, and how that needs to be pushed back against aggressively but in terms of like what he's saying, this is this means nothing. He's just saying things. I mean,

He's saying that if there is a blood pressure, whatever, there's a thing, right. And he accepts that a doctor will prescribe that thing for its use correctly, he just blanket accepts that. All right, then there's another thing diabetes, insulin, he blanket accepts that insulin does the thing that it is supposed to do. Now, he asks the question, why do we not do something similar in this situation? There is an answer to that question. There is an answer that you could go find. You could go find the answer about fucking insulin to but you just accept that the answer to insulin is true, because that's what you've been raised to believe is true, despite the fact that you're a fucking moron.
