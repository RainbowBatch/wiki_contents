Yeah, the prologue of dawn to Grand Prairie. His book is mostly him insisting that he is not anti semitic. And then he goes and says this. First he cites a Time Magazine editorial where the author is discussing the fear of an impending conflict between Israel and Palestine where she says, quote, both sides know two things in advance of another fight. Israel will win it and it will be horribly painful. In response to this Don says quote there in in the in that succinct statement is the heart of the troubles and misery of civilization over the past 3000 years, all perpetuated by a biblical band of outcast, which history records as the tribes of Judah and Benjamin with their maniacal thirst for destruction and revenge forever. Yeesh goes on. He goes on to say that the introduction of the concept of anti semitism was done solely to make people afraid to criticize the people running the world, and that the Holocaust was faked quote, to seek the sympathy of the populations of the UK, US and Canada. make sense to me tracks to sum up what I read he's incredibly anti semitic and spends a lot of time trying to discredit the idea of anyone being called anti semitic. For instance, from his book serpent sting, he says this quote, a standard zine is Bolshevist modus operandi is to scream anti Semite at anyone who exposes any of their nefarious plans and to seek the quote sympathy factor by staging quote incidents, such as the desecration of their own cemeteries or torching their own synagogues, and blaming it on quote, Neo Nazis.

Yeah, got the Mad Max series, Lethal Weapon series, Maverick Braveheart, Pocahontas. That's nothing to sneeze at in terms of box off his 90s Where, whoa. That being said, there are also some not so successful movies in there that Alex has just forgotten about. For instance, in 1984, he had the river that lost $7 million at the box office, the Year of Living Dangerously lost about 3 million. His take on Hamlet and the man without a face barely broke even. But let's not forget that Mel's most recent movie at this point was Signs that may have done pretty well at the box office, but it bombed in my heart. Yeah, yeah. How dare you. He had a pretty good track record. But you know, these like a lot of top tier actors, there are some whiffs in the mix. But generally their star power is enough to make the money back and you just kind of forget about those ones that people do that. Unless they're like super embarrassing, or they lead to the end of someone's like star. Yeah, you generally forget about the, like, stray films that just didn't work out. Right.

And HUD and Gibson says the Catholic Church is corrupt HUD and Gibson. And rightly so that almost everything is infiltrated. It is. He doesn't like Hitler. You can ask him about that.
