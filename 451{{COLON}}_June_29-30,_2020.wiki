Today, Dan and Jordan discuss the beginning of the week on The Alex Jones Show. Weirdly, Alex doesn't brag much about his failure of an anti-mask rally, instead spending his time complaining about Sacha Baron Cohen, trying to prod his audience closer to committing murders, and reminding Roger Stone that Trump is an attractive man.
