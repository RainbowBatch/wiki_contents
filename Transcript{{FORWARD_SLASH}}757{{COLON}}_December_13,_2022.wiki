He believes that Nick is willing to play the game of using code and and all that because that has been done in the past. Yeah. And Alex was able to do business with him. For a couple years, he went on the stop the steel tour with him and Ali Alexander. Yep. And so like, I think that Alex is inviting him back on to give him a like, look, come on.

What did you mean by you love Hitler. What do you love about Hitler? What is DEFCON mean? Is that a threat and so on. And he's done several interviews, he did an interview with Piers Morgan with Lex Friedman with Tim Poole with you with Gavin. And in all the interviews, it's so focused on the Hitler, it's focused on the Jewish. And for a lot of people, they might say, Oh, well, of course, that's an outrageous thing to say it's so provocative. And maybe that was the intention. Maybe it was about publicity. Maybe it was staged. But if you listen, if you listen to what the man is saying, he has said, what got us to this point? I think that it's almost it says something in itself that the conversation is about the remark rather than all the, in my opinion, far more outrageous things going on all around, which is that right now the ADL is shaking down Congress.

This naturally has prompted a response for people who find this shit abhorrent. And they've gotten a lot of criticism for this over the top anti semitic shit. Now, Nick is coming back. And he's saying, look at all these people who are so focused on the anti semitic over the top shit that we said, Isn't it suspicious that all this feedback that we've gotten has been about the Jewish stuff?

The ADL made the appropriations request that they're talking about that Nick is saying like, Oh, he was in response to us. They made that request in April.

Yeah, that's there. The third thing is that Nick literally said that his show deals with the Jewish question. And Alex said, there's a good debate to have there. No one and I mean, no one outside of white supremacist, white nationalist, or neo Nazi communities uses terms like the Jewish question, or the abbreviation JQ, I guess people who monitor and criticize those communities or historians might use the term too, but you get what I mean, that ain't a dog whistle that is a bullhorn. And it's not a little tiny bullhorn? No, it is a big old bullhorn. Yeah. For Alex to either not grasp that or hear it and go along with it is damning. It can only mean that he's either in support of Nick's anti semitic ideology, or that he's, uh, no way equipped to have these conversations. And every time he does, he's just gonna get run over by the person who's interviewing. It's very, very bad. Yeah, I mean, there's no, if you say the Jewish question, interview over

No. And it's pretty amazing to see how little respect Nick has for Alex's entire worldview. Yep, he doesn't agree with Alex on fundamental base level aspects of reality. So without addressing that this conversation is convoluted. Alex can't convince Nick of anything because Nick is a reasonably smart person and he's not one of Alex's trapped audience members. Alex's flimsy distractions and nonsensical conspiracies work on his listeners because they're not really processing what he's saying and almost every guest that he has on as a fellow con artists so they just know how to play along. Nick doesn't care about pretending to agree with Alex is stupid. Shit because he has his own agenda to advance. So you have a rejection of fundamental elements of Alex's world being voiced comfortably and confidently on the show by someone Alex has complimented as smart repeatedly. That's a problem and it's why you see Alex begin to interrupt Nick more at this point in the interview. When he hears, I don't know how convincing that is. Alex knew he couldn't let that sentence continue because Nick is about to explain why Alex's ideas unconvincing and that is dangerous. Alex's ideas aren't supposed to be possible to disagree on because they're based on discernment and documents and divine revelation. If Nick continued on that path, Alex will be unable to show his world to be real at all. And he'd be forced to fall back on outbursts and theatrics, which looks bad in comparison to Nick being calm, collected non confrontational for the most part.

Then he says that we need to transcend things on policy ideas and actual issues. None of that has happened on the show at all today. Nick has been pretty clear about the policies he'd like to explore in this and other appearances. He wants to abolish the First Amendment wants to create federal laws regarding where Jews can and cannot work and basing most of the government's decisions on a rigid fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity. Yeah, if Alex actually wanted to transcend things, whatever that means, in the realm of policy, he could have started their defeat Nick's desire to ban pornography and even sexy images and the battlefield of ideas by explaining how that attack on speech threatens a wide variety of other forms of speech and expression.

I think it was from a 2022 midterm election attack on Wisconsin governor Tony Evers, Evers had worked as the superintendent of the Department of Public Instruction between 2009 and 2019. At some point during that span, the DPI worked with a group called Volunteers in Service to America or Vista. In 2013, VISTA handed out a document titled addressing racial privilege, a mental model for white anti racists, which included a section that had a suggestion of wearing a white wristband that you can use as a conversation starter, about your commitment to equality and acknowledgement of white privilege. I believe that that's the story that's at the root of this. Okay, because I've heard Alex complain about it before. Alright, seems like you might have exaggerated that story out a little bit to be a counterweight right

The other side, the Hammonds were Germans who'd come here pretty recently. And they weren't not Jewish. They were blond haired, blue eyed. And they were in World War Two. And they know what went on. And they told me know Hitler was bad. And they told me what went on and how the rich Germans in Dallas. Once Hitler got into power in 33, they would blackmail German family members, not my family to people who might My grandfather worked with, and suck money out other than what so when I heard about Hitler doing that, and blackmailing people and sucking money, my family told me went on. Show I grew up actually hearing about all of that. Then my grandfather worked in secret weapons programs. And I only heard a little bit of that my mom heard him talk about he would ever talk about it. But I remember him bitching when I'm like eight years old about in weapons projects, and how he knew he went and he knew Verner von Braun all of it, and how he had to deal with these damn Nazis and how arrogant they were and how I didn't like him. So I mean, I grew up with both grandfathers had been in World War Two, they both dealt with the Nazis, and they both didn't like Nazis. And so I didn't get it from Captain America. I didn't get it from Hollywood. I didn't get it from any of that. I got it from my badass grandfather. So now look people today like, holy like these guys. Were frickin badasses.

And for us my question I just want to say, you know, maybe it is time for you know, the right conservatives to stop invoking Hitler and the left to always deflect to Hitler. But, Alex, I got to ask man, don't you agree that the Germans are fighting for a better future for all of Europe? In World War Two, I mean, aside from like the tactics of the war and Hitler, you keep repeating that you're German. Don't you think that Europe would be in a better place now?

There's horrible iniquity, and horrible injustice going on in the world. If you're a Christian, you have to be disgusted. At the state of our country, like I said, the filth in the media, the filth in our school system, the groomers, the porn, the media, it's terrible and to sit by and watch all these innocent people in some kind of quietist you know, people call this the Benedict option.

It does not to Alex's behavior does not make me confident that he's going to be able to navigate the more choppy waters that we're going to be getting into as we get closer to the 2024 election, whether or not yeh continues as a quote unquote, candidate or not. But but even if he even if he doesn't, this isn't where this ends. No, that's true, this pageant that we're in the middle of that is true.
