'''Wayne Madsen''' is an investigative reporter who seems to have a particular interest in hating the Clintons and saying that Mossad is behind pretty much every tragedy in the world, from 9/11, to the murders carried out by Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik. Since 2015, Wayne and Alex have had a falling out, with Wayne tweeting out that Alex is a "bloated lying shitbag." He has also recently taken to tweeting very anti-Trump stuff, and retweeting Alex Jones' ex-wife's tweets about how Alex is a racist.
