Today, Dan and Jordan check in on Alex to see how he handled Biden's recent speech about MAGA people.  Turns out he didn't take it well, and in response, he decided to spend his workday trying to make his listeners really scared about a wide range of ideas.

== Errata ==
Despite Dan and Jordan's skepticism, there is in fact an ongoing Ukrainian refugee crisis at the US-Mexico border<ref>https://www.npr.org/2022/04/13/1092091451/ukrainians-have-arrived-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-by-the-thousands</ref>. The reason is that it's difficult to apply for US refugee status at embassy in Europe, but easier to come to Mexico as a tourist and then apply at the border<ref>https://refugees.org/statement-on-uscris-visit-to-tijuana-the-benito-juarez-shelter-and-ukrainians-at-the-border/</ref>. An important part of this story is the ways in which Ukrainian and Latin American refugees are experiencing very different outcomes at the US border, with Ukrainian refugees being processed much much faster<ref>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/770/transcript</ref>.
