Today, Dan and Jordan welcome [https://twitter.com/rothschildmd Mike Rothschild] back to the show to discuss how Alex disparaged him on the show a couple weeks back.  In order to make it through this episode, Mike has to endure the critiques of Alex and at least two Infowars callers, which is no problem as it turns out.
