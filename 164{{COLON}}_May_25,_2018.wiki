Today, Dan tells Jordan all about the May 25th episode of The Alex Jones Show. Dan breaks down some of the more completely idiotic "new items" Alex decides to cover, then the gents get to wrestle with the weirdest thing that's happened on the show in a long time: Alex has an interview with Michael Rotondo, the 30 year old who wouldn't move out of his parents' house. It's really messed up for everyone involved.
