Today, Dan and Jordan finish up the 2015 investigation for real over a bottle of wine. The gents discuss how clear it becomes on closer analysis that Alex Jones was the victim of a dirty trick/psyop at the end of 2015 that led him to end up supporting Donald Trump. Probably a coincidence that he was hanging out with a dirty trickster and psyop specialist at the time.
