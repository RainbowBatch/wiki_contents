===Narratives===

This episode is being recorded the day after the March For Our Lives, the pro-gun regulation rally being organized by the Parkland shooting survivors, among others. The event was a huge success, bringing out hundreds of thousands of people in DC, and tons more in cities around the country.

Naturally, this is incredibly threatening to Alex, since he might as well be married to his gun and see every criticism of guns as an attack on their holy union. I think Alex's heart and soul wasn't 100% on Sunday, so to make sure there's enough testosterone in the studio, he has Owen Shroyer co-host with him, which leads to Alex forcing Owen into a bunch of weird high-fives.

[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522075029784-1LBC95XNGA92W8GZTWVV/hifive1.jpg|thumb|none]]

[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522075054362-TZR19ZQIKJYYNPBQ5WA0/hifive2.jpg|thumb|none]]

These two pictures were taken during two separate high-fives within about four minutes. It was a wild time.

Most of the show, naturally, is designed to introduce all the necessary talking points that are needed to discredit the March For Our Lives. You hear almost all of the same narratives you saw with the Women's March (or any other gathering that Alex would rather not be allowed to happen, but he knows that argument is against the first amendment and would sort of reveal him as a fascist), but what is fascinating is how the same narratives are being fed by the same people.

For instance, back with the post-election rallies, Jack Posobiac was the source of "information" Alex reported about how there were buses parked nearby that brought people to the rally, which they extrapolated to necessarily mean that George Soros paid them all to be there. This time, it's once again Jack Posobiac who has provided that "information" for Alex:

Remember, if you see buses anywhere, it is proof of Globalist trickery.

Beyond all that, this episode is an absolute hodge-podge of terrible arguments that never really come together.

Alex complains that David Hogg was reading off a script at the rally when he gave his speech. A rational person would reply, "well, he's a 17 year old kid with very limited live public speaking experience who is now giving a speech to a crowd larger than any that most people will ever address."

Without providing any evidence, save for a few stray mentions of the Women's March, Alex asserts that George Soros is bankrolling this entire rally, in an attempt to take any validity away from the arguments that the people may be expressing.

A couple of extremely fucked up things keep happening throughout the show.

The first is that Alex is continuing his terrible defense that he "didn't say the kids at Parkland were crisis actors." Here is what he says about that on today's episode:

Alex is walking this bizarre line that makes no sense, and he's doing so because he knows people are actually paying attention to him now. Whereas in the days of Sandy Hook, he could literally say that no kids died there, he can't get away with that level of bullshit now, so he has to restrict his efforts to mostly just "muddying water."

If you listen to that clip, however, you'll see that what he is saying is that David Hogg, and presumably Emma Gonzalez (who he strangely isn't as obsessed with, though she is as front and center as Hogg is) were actors and had parents who are tied in with Alex's version of the "Deep State." They were in the "acting club" and they have been "chosen" and are "going off a script."

Here's the thing: in order for Alex's version of events to play out, and for Hogg to really have been chosen and scripted by his FBI or CNN parent, they would have had to have been lying in waiting. The FBI and CNN would have to have children in every school that could possibly be the location of a mass shooting, so their child would be ready to be chosen in the event of a tragedy occurring, and they would have to have their children ready and "scripted" almost immediately, since David Hogg got interviewed pretty quickly after the shooting.

The only other way for Alex's timeline to work out is that the shooting was a planned event, which is what he hopes is the conclusion you will come to based on his "just vague enough to not get sued" words. It's complete bullshit, and represents a level of cowardice on Alex's part that is embarrassing. Just say what you mean, Alex. If it's true, you won't get sued.

The other thing that's really messed up is that Owen keeps trying to suggest that David Hogg is "just going through a rebellious phase:"

I will keep this in mind as I watch twenty-something year old Owen Shroyer grow up and possibly realize the dangers of the rhetoric he's actively putting out into the world. I won't hold my breath.

In terms of fun stuff that happens on the show, we get a nice instance of Alex telling a clearly fake story about getting mobbed by a very ethnically diverse crowd of fans at Six Flags:

This is somewhat in service of a narrative that he's been pushing for a long time: that the youth, Generation Z, is mostly Libertarian Conservatives, and that the tide is turning. You see him telling these stories about being a rock star at his kids' soccer games and shit, and obviously it is him telling exaggerated stories that stroke his grandiose ego, but at one point on this show, he says that studies show that Gen Z is all like him:

Alex says "studies," but what he's actually talking about is one "study" carried out by a British marketing company called The Gild. Their results are the source that is universally cited in articles that discuss the coming generation's shift toward conservatism.

The problem is that The Gild's "study" is wildly unscientific. It is basically just a browser quiz with no procedural controls or methodology. It is the political orientation equivalent of a "Which Member of NSYNC Are You?" quiz you may have taken on Buzzfeed years ago.

This study should absolutely be discounted, as it doesn't meet the standards of what qualifies as a representative sampled study. For a more in-depth look at this study, [http://afterthemillennials.com/why-generation-z-is-not-more-conservative/ you can click here].

After the first hour, Alex leaves Owen to host, so what's the point in listening to that?

===Guests===

*'''Mike Cernovich''': Cernovich is a pile of garbage. Mike found his first crumbs of success as a member of the Pick Up Artist community. As a self-styled Fuck Guru, Mike gave dudes incredibly fucked up advice, like "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160318163008/http://www.dangerandplay.com/2012/02/27/when-masturbation-leads-to-a-close/ when in doubt, whip it out]." He made a very smooth transition into being a figure in Gamergate, as it seemed like a novel new way for him to attack women and pretend it's politics. After this, Mike made his way to Trump and the Alt-Right because he was concerned about "[http://archive.is/JtEAY white genocide]." After realizing that he was literally in bed with Nazis, he started pretending he wasn't "alt-right," but was "alt-light," as if there was a distinction. Much like Paul Joseph Watson, he's pretended to leave the Trump Train a few times, probably to cultivate the image of independence, only to come right back into the fold immediately. In Dec. 2017, Mike started trying to "report" on fraudulently created documents claiming to be sexual assault accusations against Chuck Schumer, indicating that he either was involved in the forgery or he was too bad a journalist to realize that they were terrible fakes and "reported" on them anyway. He is literally too much of a monster to describe here, so check here if you want more of [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mike_Cernovich the Greatest Hits].
*'''Gerald Celente''': "Trends forecaster." Celente is, much like all of Alex's "financial guests" like Harry Dent or Peter Schiff, only on the show to spread pessimism and dread about the state of the economy. Though the numbers look good, don't trust them! He has a rich history of predicting market collapses on Alex's show, and then they never happen.

===Narratives===

It seems like today is basically a repeat episode of The Alex Jones Show, as the first hour is almost entirely devoid of anything that doesn't feel like well-traveled roads.

Many a complaint is made by Alex about how he is the real victim in the Parkland shooting. That probably sounds a bit extreme, but I don't doubt he really thinks that. If he truly believes that the "democrat-Deep-State-Globalist" cabal is using the shooting to take away the first and second amendments and are doing that by specifically attacking him, of course he thinks that's worse than, oh I don't know, being a kid who got murdered at their school.

His premise more or less relies on the idea that Soros is behind the March For Our Lives, which is a claim he makes repeatedly, but never really proves, beyond yelling about how there were a ton of buses in DC. Everyone knows that where there are a lot of buses parked, all of those buses must be paid for/chartered/rented by the same person. Buses are the dead-ringer of a Globalist trick.

Even if some community or charity groups that were involved in the rally had received funding from Soros or The Open Society, that means literally nothing. In this very episode, Alex Jones calls himself "the prophet of the Tea Party," [http://time.com/secret-origins-of-the-tea-party/ which was a movement completely bankrolled and created by billionaire Koch brothers]. So, using Alex's own logic about the March For Our Lives, what does that mean? It's utter bullshit; just because the Koch brothers created the Tea Party, that is not outright evidence that every member of the Tea Party does not believe the things they are advocating for.

Alex tries to make the argument that at the March For Our Lives was not about sensible gun regulation, but actually about killing gun owners if they won't turn in their guns. He cites the fact that there were some people in the crowd with signs that indicated that the goal was taking away guns.

To use the same analogy from the Tea Party, we need not look far to find examples of people at Tea Party events holding signs referring to Obama as a monkey, using outright racial slurs, or even worse. Implying that one person's sign applies to the entirety of a protest is what's known as a composition fallacy, where you believe that characteristics one part of a group are indicative of the character of the whole. You would hope that people who try to encourage people to not have signs that are off-message, but the first amendment allows them to protest however they feel.

Beyond this sort of stuff, most of the show is really just Alex (and Mike Cernovich) building up their credentials as victims and how their lives are in danger. Their complaints seem to come down to how people are paying attention to them and calling them out for their words, whereas they used to be able to hide in the dark corners of the internet.

Alex makes an absurd claim about how mass shootings "in red states" always end in minutes because good guys with guns show up, but in blue states, they love to keep create situations where victims can be killed with impunity. This is categorically not based on any reality, and we did [https://knowledgefight.com/business/2018/3/26/alex-jones-does-not-understand-mass-shootings an in-depth look at the claim here].

Beyond this nonsense, we learn from Mike Cernovich's appearance that he doesn't really have any principles and his behavior is mostly directed by whatever raises his book sales. This is demonstrated by him explaining that when he went on the "mainstream media," it didn't move any books, but he sells a lot from InfoWars.

One might suggest that, the reason he didn't sell any books from being on the "mainstream media" is that when he was on, they very fairly made him look like the asshole lunatic he is. On the other hand, InfoWars is basically the QVC for unemployable, paranoid con-men; it would be a profound embarrassment if he wasn't able to sell books on InfoWars.

This is behavior that Cernovich has engaged in in the past too. When his MAGA Mindset book didn't sell as well as his older book, Gorilla Mindset, he took to his Periscope channel and announced that he was "off the Trump train," and he even referenced the book sales as one of the main reasons for it.

It's a petty thing to point out that these people are all con-men, and their motivation to spread hate, confusion, and lies always goes back to money. Their allegiances are bought, and where the dollar is, there they will go.

*'''Ben Garrison''': Garrison is perhaps the most prominent conservative political cartoonist alive today. Incidentally, he's also terrible at political cartooning. It's not even that his conservative worldview is what makes the cartoons bad, it's more that he has a strange habit of labeling everything in his cartoons which is really the sign of a lack of craft. If the point you're trying to make isn't clear without labels on everything, it may be a sign that you need to work harder. Garrison appears on the show in a silly cowboy hat, which I did enjoy.
*'''Jack Posobiec''': Posobiec is a Trump-hack "journalist" who also [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-jack-posobiecya-busted seriously pushed the idea that Pizzagate was a sex dungeon in the non-existent basement of Comet Ping Pong Pizza]. He was outed as being in "military intelligence," but in reality what that meant was that he was doing piss tests on Marines. Jack has had his hands in far too many fraudulent media propaganda campaigns (Macron Leaks, the "Rape Melania" sign, etc) to detail all of them. Alex treats him as if he is some kind of expert on international relations, which is hilarious. Jack really sucks.

===Narratives===

On this show, Alex unveils a video (made by Darren McBreen) which shows footage from the March For Our Lives, mostly footage of the kids who survived the Parkland shooting and aren't thrilled about having to have gone through that, and juxtaposes it with audio of Hitler:

A lot of people got understandably mad about this, but as far as I can tell, this is just one of Alex's standard publicity stunts. He knows that if he does something like this, thousands of people will tweet about him, people will write articles about him, and he will get an absurd amount of free press. He's the P.T. Barnum of bigoted political speech.

Alex's rhetoric is repulsive, and he should be ashamed of himself, but this is still an instance of him operating within the realm of free speech to a certain extent. Society would be much better off if they ignored him when he says stuff like this, and made a bigger deal of his overt white nationalism (last week, he said that "whites are being exterminated in Rhodesia").

Once Alex gets to the news, one of his main stories is about how former Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens has come out against the 2nd amendment:

Alex is referring to an opinion piece that Stevens wrote for The New York Times, and I am guessing that Alex just read the headline, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/john-paul-stevens-repeal-second-amendment.html Repeal The Second Amendment]" and that was enough for him to know what it was all about.

The argument that Stevens is making is that until 2008, in District of Columbia vs. Heller, the second amendment was not legally understood to mean that individuals had the right to own guns. That was an issue left unsettled by the Supreme Court until then, and even in that decision, the judges came to a 5-4 decision.

Before then, the second amendment was more or less understood in its historical context, specifically that states had the right to keep militias to protect themselves from encroachment by other states or the federal government. It is a matter of great debate whether or not this was ever intended to guarantee the right of an individual to own a firearm.

The argument that Stevens lays out is that the National Rifle Association, a special interest group, is behind the muddying of the waters. Their deceitful efforts to apply the second amendment to fight against any regulations about gun ownership went so far that former Chief Justice Burger said that the NRA was perpetuating "one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime."

Stevens suggests that the second amendment, as a guarantee of the right to maintain a militia, is obsolete. Further, the second amendment, as a guarantee of the right to individual ownership of guns, is not a fully decided matter. As such, he says that gun-control advocates should just try to propose a new amendment that would undo the second amendment, which would in turn cripple the NRA's ability to block legislation that would protect citizens.

I'm not sure if I totally agree with his argument, but I respect it as being offered in good faith by someone who knows the issues, and I do not think Alex read the article.

The truth is that there is no need to repeal an amendment, since even in DC vs. Heller, the decision provided by the Supreme Court very clearly pointed out that [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf the second amendment is compatible with gun-control regulations]:

<blockquote>"Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms

"</blockquote>

— DC vs. Heller, p. 2

The debate is not Pro-Gun People vs. Anti-Gun People; what we are living in is a coordinated campaign against rationality and decency being carried out by the NRA and the media/political figures that they have paid off.

Around the second hour of the show, Alex has political cartoonist Ben Garrison on the show, and what ends up happening is a pretty hilarious scene. Alex's earpiece isn't working at the beginning of the interview, so he is unable to communicate with Garrison:

In order to deal with this, Alex just has Garrison vamp and ramble while he tries to fix his earpiece behind the scenes. Unfortunately, Alex forgot to turn off his mic, and some of his yelling was caught on air while Garrison was trying to make some stupid point about Karl Marx:

The rest of the interview is not really that interesting. It's just Alex telling Garrison that his work is perfect. It's so good, says Alex. Consider below, a sample of Garrison's work:

[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522525012484-3R9RM72E1ZZ8CW0A1IHB/ben.jpg|thumb|none]]

If you zoom in, you'll see "Gang" as a label on the guy's head inside the saloon that has no ice.

Also, considering that Alex and Roger Stone are currently pushing the narrative that Jeff Sessions has dementia and needs to be taken out of office, I'm not sure even Alex would sign off on this one. Odds are Alex doesn't even like Garrison's work, he's probably just angling for a way to sell his comics on InfoWars' website and make a little cut of the money.

On this episode, Alex begins to predict that "something big" is coming, and that he feels a "disturbance in the force that he hasn't felt since just before 9/11." This sounds pretty extreme, but it's that language is something he employs all the time. Just trying to get the audience good and scared, so they're in a state of mind to buy his products.

*'''Shazia Hobbs''': Hobbs is a former Muslim. [https://marias.org.uk/shazia-hobbs-forced-to-marry-and-violently-abused-under-sharia-in-the-uk/ When she was 18], she was made to have an arranged marriage that she did not want, which resulted in her suffering great abuse and beatings from her husband. After 3 years, she left her husband and was disowned by her former community. This is a tragic story, and we empathize with her greatly. We also philosophically agree with her that female genital mutilation must end. All that said, all of her credibility goes directly into the rubbish bin because she is [https://tommyrobinson.online/2018/03/meet-shazia-hobbs/ clearly working with Tommy Robinson], noted conman and xenophobic agitator.

All that said, genital mutilation is a problem, and there are a [http://16days.thepixelproject.net/16-organisations-charities-and-grassroots-groups-working-to-stop-fgm/ lot of non-Tommy Robinson related organizations] working hard to stop it.

===Narratives===

Most of the first hour of the show is dedicated to building up and screaming about anti-China narratives. Part of this is absolutely rooted in providing cover for Russia by saying, "but what about China, they're the real bad guys!"

This argument would hold more water if the things that Alex chose to criticize China about were more rooted in reality. Take, for example, this clip:

According to Alex Jones, China has the "keys to the kingdom," an analogue to something in the movie Elysium, because of course it's something from a movie. He's making the claim that China has control over all our telecommunications and that Google gave them that access recently.

The problem is that Alex is lying about what Google did. [http://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-icloud-china-iphone-data-privacy If you read the actual story], it's very clear that what Google did (which still isn't great) is that they moved the encryption keys for Chinese Google iCloud users to a local company in China, which all but guarantees that the government will have access to users' information. This has literally nothing to do with iCloud data for customers around the world; they are not encryption keys for anything except Chinese users.

A legitimate criticism would be that Google should defend privacy, and maybe should choose to cease doing business in China, rather than give the government free reign to access users' data. An illegitimate one is what Alex is doing: creating a fake version of the story to scream about because it kind of fits in with his larger conspiracies about China and Google.

Alex spends a lot of time on the show kind of obsessed about how cultures treat women. His contention is that the West is "based on worshiping women:"

His argument fails to account for the fact that women weren't allowed to vote for the first 144 years that America was a thing. It also fails to account for the fact that until 1922, women lost their citizenship if they married a foreigner, because it was just assumed that she had to be subservient to her husband (women still wouldn't be able to retain their citizenship if they married an Asian man until 1931). Alex seems to not know that [https://casetext.com/posts/reed-v-reed-some-background it was completely legal to just not allow women to practice law in the United States until 1971]. This is to say nothing about how until very recently, the idea of beating your wife was so common and uncontroversial that it was a frequent joke in popular culture.

If these are some of the manifestations of a culture that "worships women," we need to examine what the hell worshiping means. We know damn well what he's talking about, and false worship is nothing more than a bullshit public face for suppression and cultural abuse.

Also, this sort of shit would sound a lot less like a rationalization for him to treat women like things (instead of as autonomous individuals), if he didn't say that a female caller was sexy, completely unprompted later on this very show:

Alex has an interview on this episode with Shazia Hobbs, and most of it is just Alex trying to use it as an opportunity to attack London mayor Sadiq Khan as an "Islamacist."

What this came from is that in a video for the End The Hate campaign, Khan read a tweet of Hobbs's and editorialized that she was preaching hate. For context, the text of her tweet is as follows:

<blockquote>"If you use a knife to mutilate your daughter's vagina will the full force of the law be brought down on you? Asking for a Muslim. Thanks.

"</blockquote>

I'm thinking, possibly, that the reason one might have a negative response to this tweet is the "asking for a Muslim" part. It kind of paints the picture that Muslims are the only people who engage in genital mutilation, which is patently absurd. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110570413000258 Christians throughout Africa engage in the practice], among plenty of other groups around the world. It's not an Islam issue, it is a men abusing women issue.

This highlights one of the very interesting hypocrisies of Alex Jones and his circle's approach to Islam. On the one hand, they argue that all Muslims are violent and dangerous because they believe that the Koran is violent, and Islam is a very orthodox religion. They make this argument to imply that whatever words are literally in the Koran, all Muslims must literally follow.

But then, as it relates to female genital mutilation, they will ignore that the prophet Mohammed said:

<blockquote>"Trim, but do not cut into it, for this is brighter for the face (of the girl) and more favorable with the husband

"</blockquote>

They will ignore that Islamic scholars have interpreted the texts on the issue to be prohibiting of the behavior of genital mutilation, but permissive of circumcisions that do no harm to the recipient. Dr. Abd al-Rahmân b. Hasan al-Nafisah [https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/442/female-circumcision-in-islam-part-2/ wrote an article on Islam and female circumcision] where he concluded:

<blockquote>"In Islamic Law, preservation of the person – the life and bodily soundness of the person – is a legal necessity. Anything that compromises this legal necessity by bringing harm to the person is unlawful

"</blockquote>

It is much easier to scapegoat an entire community than it is to realize that all groups contain abusers, and figuring out who they are is a complicated process. In American culture, we've seen how abusers like Harvey Weinstein use their positions of influence as shields that protect them from the truth getting out. It's no different in other cultures, even if the positions of influence aren't "fame," but instead "community stature" or something along those lines.

Anyway, this is all to say that Alex is stupid.

But on this episode, he's not just stupid, he's incredibly scary. There is a real violent anger in Alex on this show, and it just keeps popping it's head up:

This sort of rhetoric is wildly dangerous, and is a sign of where Alex's head is at. It's a really sad glimpse into a man full of impotent rage, lashing out at an imaginary enemy while scapegoating real people who suffer real consequences, all the while sexualizing his female callers.

This was a pretty messed up episode.

*'''Ted Nugent''': Nugent is a complete lunatic who has made a couple of very catchy rock songs, and that apparently means he gets to be famous for life. In his post-relevance career, he has become a huge voice in the gun loving community. He loves guns so much that he frequently goes on stage with multiple large guns in hand and tells people like Obama (not in attendance) to suck on them. When he was 30, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html he became a 17 year old girl's legal guardian so he could have sex with her] without her parents protesting. [http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/courtney-love-i-gave-ted-nugent-oral-sex-at-age/ Courtney Love has alleged that she performed oral sex on him when he was 29 and she was 12]. He has a troubling pattern of referring to his political enemies as "cockroaches," which in the past has been a very offensive way people have characterized immigrants, minorities and dissenters. Overall, Ted Nugent sucks.
*'''Tommy Robinson''': Noted anti-Muslim agitator, and career criminal ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130313170714/http://news.sky.com/story/1034468/edl-leader-lennon-jailed-for-passport-offence convicted for having a fake passport in 2012], [http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-25110639 sentenced to 18 months in prison for mortgage fraud in 2014], to name a few crimes).

Tommy Robinson seriously sucks.
*'''Marc Morano''': Marc is a climate change denier, and runs a site called Climate Depot. Climate Depot is a project funded and created by the think tank Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow, which believe it or not, [https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Committee_for_a_Constructive_Tomorrow received at least $500,000 in funding from ExxonMobil]. This is always the case for climate change deniers, you can always trace their funding back to oil companies or Koch-related foundations (which is also true in this case). Marc was also involved in the deceitful propaganda campaign against John Kerry known as the Swiftboating, where conservative liars spread lies about Kerry's military service in hopes of swaying the 2004 election. He has a career long track record of being a liar for hire, and thus, fits right in with Alex Jones.

===Narratives===

This show is all over the place, hitting on a lot of Alex's favorite talking points: Islam is evil at its core, guns are the greatest thing in the world, and liberals are "the enemy." Overall, it's a pretty boring show.

I will break down the things that merit mentioning in bullet form:

*Alex airs a video of his 15 year old son Rex challenging David Hogg to a debate. It is one of the most disgraceful, embarrassing, and horrifying things I've ever seen in my life. The way Rex was talking bordered on an Alex Jones impression, and he was using many of Alex's catchphrases. It was very clear that either Alex coached him, or worse, he doesn't realize that he is emulating a horrible role-model. We still believe criticism of Rex himself is off-limits, as he is a child and he is being exploited, but I bring this up because of how poorly it reflects on Alex.
*Alex spends a large chunk of this show screaming about how Muslims want to have sex with children, not realizing that two of his guests on ''this very day's show'', Tommy Robinson and Ted Nugent, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120530013851/http://www.loonwatch.com/2012/05/edl-leader-tommy-robinson-outed-as-child-sex-pest/ have sexually harassed underage girls on Twitter] or [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html adopted a 17 year old when he was 30 so he could have sex with her without her parents protesting] (and may have done way worse stuff too). Alex is a complete idiot.
*Alex calls for the indictment of Robert Mueller, screaming vague accusations about him being "on tarmacs." This is a reference to how Mueller delivered a sample of uranium that was confiscated from criminals to Russian authorities as part of a joint investigation. It was entirely above board, but Alex uses it because he is really scared about the stories that are coming out that notorious fraud-committer Ted Malloch may be in Mueller's cross hairs. And Alex should be concerned. Malloch was very involved in the Brexit campaign, and he was a behind-the-scenes adviser for the Trump campaign, the common thread between those things being Cambridge Analytica. If Mueller is speaking to Malloch, that is a pretty obvious sign that they have some information that his role in those two campaigns may have been connected.

Beyond those main points that are pretty interesting, there are a few stray things Alex says here and there that seem very weird, but also seem kind of like him speaking extemporaneously. For instance, he says that he likes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. That seems strange, but since he doesn't really get into it, I'll wait until he elaborates to judge what he's talking about.

Also, Alex goes on a collaborative rant with Tommy Robinson about how the Russians did not try to kill Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The rest of the world is pretty much in consensus that they did, but I guess Alex has better information. He's usually right about everything.

The two of them scream about how "they" aren't even telling people if the ex-spy and his daughter are alive, which is weird because that is a [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/29/597937016/daughter-of-ex-russian-spy-improving-rapidly-u-k-health-officials-say very easy piece of information to find].

My favorite part of the rant is when Alex posits that if Russia was behind the attempted murder, they wouldn't have used a nerve agent, because smart assassins use "a bag." Alright, Alex.

Doug Hagman hosted the 4th Hour of the show, and I only watched a little bit of it because he's very boring, but thankfully I didn't turn it right off. In the beginning of their interview, Alex reveals that he definitely believes that the "Globalists" drink children's blood and that they need to scare them to produce adrenochrome.

This man loves to pretend he's just talking metaphorically when he calls people vampires, because he knows that when he makes the accusations literal, as he does here, it's really easy to see how most of his beliefs about the "Globalists" are just slight variations on generations old Blood Libel and other antisemitic propaganda.

*'''Katie Hopkins''': Hopkins is a former reality star from the UK. She is most notable for being a brutal Islamophobe, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/23/manchester-attack-police-investigate-katie-hopkins-final-solution-tweet calling for a "final solution"] after the Manchester bombing in 2017.

At a UKIP conference, Hopkins suggested that it would be okay [https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/09/watch-ukip-supporter-katie-hopkins-advocates-gassing-the-house-of-lords/ if the House of Lords was "sealed up and gassed]." She is a dangerous bigot at best, and a Nazi at worst.
*Joel Gilbert hosted the 4th Hour, and we could not care less about what he covered.

===Narratives===

Alex begins by really doubling down on the "Parkland kids are Nazis" narrative he's been spinning. Whereas before, Alex had just been saying that he knew this because David Hogg was wearing an arm-band at the rally last weekend. Now, Alex is saying that Hogg was doing "heel-clicks," which really seals the deal. It's a load of nonsense.

Alex announces that he has just bought a Hitler outfit that is on the way to the studio, and he plans to make a "satire" video where he, as Hitler, endorses Hillary. It is always fun when we get to see a desperate publicity stunt being planned on air.

Alex then elaborates on his past, particularly as it relates to abortions. In the past, he had admitted that he has paid for multiple abortions in the past. On today's episode, he clarifies that he has been involved in 10 abortions in his life. Far be it from me to judge, but it seems like a guy should probably learn their lesson and change their behaviors, say, somewhere around abortion #3.

After he makes this admission, Alex fakes a phone call coming in that he needs to take, and has the staff air about 10 minutes of anti-abortion videos.

This is sort of a theme of this episode: Alex is not really into doing the job. He plays a ton of videos, he is killing time with standards "blah, blah, blah, Soros is a Nazi, blah, blah, blah" rants, and at one point he even has guest Katie Hopkins host the show for a segment, filled almost entirely with white genocide lies, while he does something else off air.

One of the things I find most interesting about Alex's interview with Katie Hopkins is not the content. It is par for the course to have Alex and his guests full-throatedly advocate for white nationalism. What is interesting to me is that Alex has recently been getting kind of horny on air when he's talking to women, and I'm not sure what this means:

It's not that this constitutes sexual harassment or anything, and Katie seems fine with Alex's comments, but this is absolutely unprofessional. It's even more bizarre considering that he is currently being sued by a former employee for sexual harassment. One would think he would not want to give off the perception that he is a little loose with sexualizing women in inappropriate contexts.

Beyond that, this show is all just Alex vamping and killing time rambling about how he is under attack because he's right all the time and the Globalists fear that. Throw in a few rants about how the liberals want to rape and kill your family, and you've got a pretty good sense of how terrible and uninspired this episode was:

I mean, Alex even said so much himself:

Alex usually does not put stuff out on Saturdays, but today, Alex put out two special reports<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/31/march-31-2018 March 31, 2018]</ref>:

1) '''David Hogg May Have Made A Joke On Reddit Last Year'''

Alex recorded a 10 minute special report about how Paul Joseph Watson had found a "confirmed" Reddit account belonging to David Hogg, and that this account posted a joke about mosquitoes killing people in 2017. This, of course, proves that he is faking his outrage at his fellow students being murdered at school while he hid in a darkened classroom, not knowing if he would be killed as well.

The post in question is in response to a question about what good do mosquitoes do, to which this account replied "They kill humans, billions of them, which is great for the environment."

On the scale of Gotcha Moments, this ranks as a zero. If this is even Hogg's account, this is a 16 year old making a joke on Reddit. Have you ever been to Reddit? This is an incredibly tame piece of business for that site.

The rest of the video is Alex lying about George Soros being a Nazi (he wasn't), about John Holdren's book Ecoscience advocating for culling the population (it doesn't), and speculating that the Rockefellers were going to spread HIV through mosquitoes ([https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/why_cant_mosquitos_transmit_hiv that is impossible]).

It was an embarrassing effort, and would have made the high water mark of Alex being an idiot for the day, but then he did this...

2) '''Alex's 15 Year Old Son Does An Old School Wrestling Promo'''

It is our editorial position that Alex's son Rex is off-limits. He is a child, and there is literally no way that he understands what underlies his father's horrible beliefs. He was brought up with a paternal figure who screams Civil War revisionist history on the air, who repeats narratives from literal Nazi propaganda films in his documentaries, and who has very clear undiagnosed mental illnesses plaguing him.

What we are getting at is that we do not blame Rex for this. But we cannot ignore it either.

Rex put out a video earlier in the week wherein he challenged David Hogg to a debate. In response to this, Alex's ex-wife Kelly contacted YouTube and insisted they remove the video, as she claimed it was a breach of an injunction in their custody agreement. It is impossible for us to know the specific details of their legal agreement, but it appears that YouTube did take down the first video.

In response to this, Alex doubled down, and Rex made another video later in the week. And then, on Saturday, they did this live video where he tries even harder to lure Hogg into a debate, and it is just tragic to watch.

Rex is doing an Alex impression through most of it. He's repeating propaganda narratives that he clearly picked up from his father. It is completely heartbreaking stuff to see.

But then, in a moment where Alex was hoping to prove that his 15 year-old son was speaking freely and there wasn't a teleprompter, the camera panned over and caught a glimpse of off-camera Alex:

[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522558435730-CH6MK8BEGUBWVDVWKD28/0.jpg|thumb|none]]

[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522558411932-5TYOKOH1MD15CA1RK8ZO/000000.jpg|thumb|none]]

Is that just a cup of water? Seems unlikely, considering Alex's penchant for drinking at the office, and his on-air behavior during these special reports. Here is a clip of him rambling and making no sense, and keep in mind, while he's saying this blather, his son is sitting right next to him:

All this is just terrible stuff. It's not even offensive in the normal way Alex is offensive; it's repellent on a visceral, human level. That said, we're still not calling for Alex to be kicked off anything, but we are sincerely begging for him to feel a modicum of shame about his behavior.
