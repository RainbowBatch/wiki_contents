'''Mark Richards''' is a convicted Murder, currently incarcerated in the California prison system. He's serving a life sentence without parole, so the chances of this changing are slim.

Despite being behind bars since 1984, Richards has had a notable impact on the UFO Conspiracy community through his wife [[Jo Ann Richards]] and [[Project Camelot]]'s [[Kerry Cassidy]], both of which relay his frankly wacky ideas to the wider world.

In Mark's own (false) telling, he can't have committed the murder because he was off-planet fighting in space wars at the time.
