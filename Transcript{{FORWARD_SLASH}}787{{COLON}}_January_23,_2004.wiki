Alex preoccupies himself quite a bit with building seven stuff, about 911. But it's not stuff that we haven't heard before. And so pretty bland. But he's very, very excited about it. And so that takes up a lot of his time over the course of multiple days. And it took a while to get to anything that I really thought merited our attention. And I'll be honest, at first, I didn't even think this was it. But after looking into it a little bit more, I found that it was quite important.

We've got Operation Rescue West, coming on in the second hour. It's a First Amendment issue, not just trying to stop the 45 million plus murders. But they have a big truck with a picture of a baby alive baby and then a dead baby on the side. And they've been arrested and are being charged. They're trying to tell people all over the country that they cannot expose what's really happening. But PBS in a show video of all the dead Jews and world war two images of 1000s of naked bodies being bulldozed into pitch and I think that's good. It's good that they show that we should know what evil is all about. We should see the results of of evil. And what happens when you don't stand up to it. But you can show the murders in Africa murders by Saddam I'm in the Middle East, you can show murders by Pol Pot, you can show murders by Hitler. But you better not show the murders in this country. They're taken down websites that show this all over the place.

    | text      = there's a difference between all of those things that Alex is listing off versus abortion, all of those other things are murders, whereas an abortion it is not. He's Welcome to his very strongly held belief that it is but that's not going to impact on most of the rest of the country feels. So this story has to do with an anti abortion group called Operation Rescue West who were charged with a misdemeanor for what they call their truth truck. The issue wasn't that they had pictures of dead babies on it. It was that in Bel Air Kansas, there's an ordinance that prohibits cars with portable signs on them, essentially banning moving billboards. The charges were dropped in March, most likely because it wasn't that big of a deal, and the city realized that the group thrived off being persecuted, so maybe wasn't even worth the trouble. Yeah. Operation Rescue West was led by a man named Troy Newman, who's going to be the guest that comes on here later, and a large amount of his specific activism against was against a reproductive care doctor in Kansas named George Taylor. In fact, the misdemeanor charge happened when he was driving his truck near the home of one of Taylor's nurses in a very clear attempt to harass and intimidate her. For years. They went after Tiller to the extent of planning a mock trial accusing him of mass murder. Incidentally, Tiller was murdered himself on made in May 2009. tillers murderer Scott Roeder was a frequent donor to Operation Rescue West and when he was arrested the phone number for Operation Rescue West's senior policy adviser Cheryl Solon, Salander was found in his car. Salinger, when pressed on it had to admit that she had spoken with rotor in the past and had specifically given him information about tillers whereabouts in the past like court appearances on the like, also sell under served two years in jail quote, after pleading guilty to conspiring to bomb an abortion clinic in California in 1988. I looked he's gonna have this guy from Operation Rescue west on the show to complain about this misdemeanor charge that's going to be dropped in a few months. But it's critical to understand that what is happening is that Alex is interviewing someone who is a stochastic terrorist, quite frankly, this is an attempt to play up this false sense of victimhood and aggrievement, which is a large part of the fuel that these groups use to inspire the domestic terrorism against people who support or provide reproductive health access. This is who Alex has always been. When we go back to the past, we see constant appearances by thinly disguised Nazis and white supremacist, we see promotion of groups that inspire domestic terrorism. And you see that in the present day, too. This is who he is. This has never been different. It's just not been as obvious in the past maybe. Well, I mean, or people weren't paying attention.

Right. So you have adjacency of like this. I don't know, I haven't looked into enough of the, let's say, anti abortion, pro life groups. But I would assume that there are some who are very disconnected from folks who would bomb an abortion clinic, you would hope. And those would be the folks that I would hope you'd interview the people who are at least more than zero steps removed from someone who planned to forbid abortion, I suppose. But instead, these are the sorts of groups that Alex elevates. He's the sort of people that he gets involved with, and it's not a coincidence. So Alex introduces Troy. And it's weird.

Who were pro choice. The highest they've ever pro polled pro life identification was in 2009 at 51%, which I think, you know, if you consider what was going on around then you could consider it a conservative resurgence that was going on due to the election. Obama Yeah, Tea Party sentiment rising. I think you can understand why there'll be a little bump there. Also, in our present day, pro life sentiment is polling almost as poorly as it ever has about 39% trailed only by like, 9096 when it was around 33. These folks use fraudulent statistics to create the impression that their extreme views and extreme actions are actually mainstream and supported by the vast majority of the population. This is meant to help radicalize the listeners of the show, while simultaneously pacifying them from any fears about whether or not what they're supporting is in fact, extremism.

Now, they're not the best candidates to be making these. They're listening to Infowars. Yeah, it's a self selected bunch. It is. Yeah.

    | text      = We know from listening to Alex for years that he has an intense burning guilt over how he's paid for at least 10 abortions. He's never really processed any of his feelings about that, and it manifests pretty regularly and outburst surrounding reproductive rights. At this point, it's not clear if Alex is being honest with the audience about his past abortions. But what we can tell from this clip is that he's very committed to projecting his own guilt onto everyone else. In his own mind, he sees supporting access to abortion as being a way that he could alleviate his own guilt. If it's not wrong to have an abortion, then he doesn't need to feel bad about his past in that area. But Alex is also a religious zealot, and he cannot be pro choice and continued to be at all appealing to the audience that he's fostered. Alex personally is trapped, but he recognizes that being pro choice would be the shortest and easiest path for him to unburden himself from that weight that he needlessly carries around, right. And thus, he assumes that's the case for everyone who supports access to abortion. They don't actually believe in the right to bodily autonomy, they don't have any principled reason for their position, they must just be looking for an easy way to alleviate their own guilt. Alex is mad because he's talking about himself. He can't deal with this color as an individual because the conversation is barely even about abortion. The caller and probably Troy think that it's about abortion, but they don't realize that the host of the show is kind of playing out a psychodrama and using them as props. Yeah, it's fucked up.

It's not like China's one child policy. It's not forced abortions. This is a ridiculous leap that Alex is making, because he never actually wants to argue real points.

    | text      = So it's pretty easy to see how Alex go to imagine that the opposition to his position is not very well considered given the callers that disagree. But he doesn't take into account that he's self selected zone opposition. People have strong well reasoned pro reproductive health arguments aren't going to be listening to Alex's show and they aren't going to call in the opposition, he has to worry about contending with our people who listen to his show that disagree with a central pillar of his worldview, which are going to be generally confused folks who are easy to dismiss, on the off chance that he gets them on with a good point calling him it's the easiest thing to just restate their argument in a dishonest way to create a straw man to attack or put them on hold and the job is done. My point is that if Alex had to argue with people who weren't Infowars listeners, he'd be fucked. Also, this lady's call is a real severe bummer. And I feel for her. She says that, and if she goes on to talk about, like abuse that she had as a child, and like her mother having, like complications from her birth, you know, it's a real heavy thing.

Alex is exaggerating the number of abortions done each year by about five times are not recognizing that number of procedures is decreasing as education improves, and there's greater access to birth control and emergency contraception. Alex is a liar painting a fraudulent picture for the audience to help justify his extremist views and make them more likely to support a group like Operation Rescue West whose senior policy adviser went to jail for planning to bomb a clinic and who very clearly inspired the murder of George tiller, right? There's not even a reason to lie here. His audience doesn't understand numbers or scale.

And then he goes, but that's not good for you. And he continues on to explain that everyone who drinks lives like he did. Everyone who goes to bars acts like he did. Everybody who's around other people is trying to fuck all the time, at no point in time is the like, well, you know, I could have also gone to therapy or something.

There is no recognition in this episode, or anything of Alex talking about himself and his own experience. He's talking about his own experience, but projecting it onto everybody else. Yeah, that to me is even more cowardly, right in what you're describing and youth pastor because at least that youth pastor would be, you'd be able to be like, dismiss what you say a little bit more. Because it's like, oh, you're dealing with something.

That is a little bit more relevant. Or I think it's more impactful user involvement was like on the ground there inciting harassing them, as opposed to, like, let's say, an anti abortion group on the West Coast, who was still mad at tiller.

And like, oh, the Trump years really brought out the worst in him. Yeah. And I mean, from a performance aspect. Yes, that's definitely true. He's become far worse a broadcaster. He's sloppy and unhinged in ways that are meant to farm attention. Yeah. Because that's more of the economy at that point. But, you know, it's important to recognize and understand that you go back as far back in his career as you can. And do you see behavior that is just as detestable and just as dangerous as stuff that he does regularly? Presently? Yeah, I

You know, it's one of the things in trying to prepare for this episode. I was also trying to look at other people we could talk about, you know, like, I texted you about, like, Matt Walsh. Michael Knowles are two dudes who are like, you know, they're both daily wire guys are like, very on the vanguard of pretty dangerous transphobic. Rant ideology, rhetoric. And so I thought like them, maybe it'd be a good I see clips of them flying around all the time on Twitter. And I thought, like, let's sit down and check out an episode of their show. And it became an intensely clear to me that there is a bit that's for attention and then an unwatchable show, right, like the rest of it. Right. And I think that there's a strategy in that. And I think it's because of the way attention economy works. Totally, I think that Alex is fairly similar. No, that's just he's not allowed on social media. We've
