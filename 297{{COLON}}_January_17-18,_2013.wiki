Today, Dan and Jordan go back to the past to explore how Alex Jones covered the days after the shooting at Sandy Hook. In this installment, everything goes crazy with completely absurd interviews. Alex interviews an insane sheriff. PJW interviews a Sandy Hook truther (poorly). Mike Adams interviews anti-vax charlatan Andrew Wakefield. It's a wild couple of days.
