    | text      = trillion. That is that is one of the numbers that you see floating around. And actually in the book, I talk about where that number might come from, because there's a there's a really good chance that it's just totally made up. But there is a book that came out in 1940 by a guy named George Washington Armstrong whose own bio notes he was like a Texas oil man and his own bio notes that he was a staunch segregationist and opponent of the 14th and 15th amendment. This book got this guy wrote a book called Rothschild money trust. And essentially, he blames the Rothschilds for his oil business going bankrupt after World War One. Sure. And he, he comes up with this number that the family has $300 billion, which I think he got from a different crank this fake Russian count, who I write about in the book, who took his own life after his United Gentiles league failed. Some real surreal characters in this one.

    | text      = Oh, yeah, there are I enjoyed your book. Growth is very, very good. It's got a very propulsive. You know, it, it's never slow. It's always taking you through each individual like aspect of where it is, this comes from, you know, we are, you know, obviously you start, right where it begins with Jesus being like, Hey, man, no charging interest.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mike Rothschild
    | timestamp = 00:07:07.000
    | text      = From there, yeah. So so this sky Armstrong, he took this figure 300 billion, and he just decided that the family made another 100 billion off of the First World War. And they are not sure, of course, and made another 100 billion off the Great Depression. And then this, he was writing in the 1940s. He's right in the 1940s. So 100 billion in the 1940s is roughly Quinn kuggeleijn, or whatever number is astronomical money. Yeah, see that? You see that with other attempts to quantify the Rothschilds network. You see these just these these amounts of money that are more money than exist when the Chinese author of currency wars is very, very popular conspiracy theory book in China, posits that the Rothschilds might have like 1.2 quadrillion dollars, it's it's numbers that are so far away from reality. They're, they're hard to talk about. Because it's like, where do you even start to come up with that?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:08:07.000
    | text      = Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, it is it is to a certain extent, like, every every joke I ever made about Austin Powers whenever he's like, $100 billion. And everybody's like, Oh, okay, I guess that's, it's just a fictional number.

    | text      = Right? You know, it's just whatever. Yeah, you find the same thing with, you know, abortion statistics, statistics, like you guys are talking about the other day, like, these numbers are just, they just come out of nowhere, and that you can't refute them, because they're totally made up. So the best you can do is try to figure out what the real number is. And suddenly, like the Rothschilds, that number probably is not really knowable, because the family is so broken up, and they've sold off so many of their assets. So you're really just guessing and when you're pushing conspiracy theories, the bigger the number, the the more traction, that's

And, and the other, you know, obviously, the prot, one of the problems you talk about in the in the book is, it doesn't matter what they could do to like, we're gonna give you an exact accounting, they could have their accounting firm, put everything out online, in line by line by line. And that would never be enough. No, it would

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:09:33.000
    | text      = Right. Right. So what I what I read one thing that I really enjoyed about the way that you structure the book is you kind of start with that premise, from the very beginning. Does that does that make sense? You know that Yeah,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mike Rothschild
    | timestamp = 00:09:46.000
    | text      = yeah. I talk about how this stuff can't really be refuted in a lot of cases. And, and that's the stance that the family has, you know, when I started putting the book proposal together, I thought, well, I got to see if I can actually We get access to these people. And of course, that was the first Yeah, as a journalist pursuing, like, if I'm pitching a book where I write about the Rothschilds, I'm supposed to talk to the Rothschilds, let's see if I can actually get access to them. I thought, oh, you know, there's this, there's gonna be great. They're gonna want to tell their story. Well, that was like, really naive of me. Because if they if they wanted to tell their story, they would just do that.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:10:23.000
    | text      = Yeah, I mean, to a certain extent, there is like a, they've been not telling their story for several 100 years at this point,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mike Rothschild
    | timestamp = 00:10:30.000
    | text      = that it would take a lot to change that. And I think my book pitch was not going to move that needle. But what I was able to do was talk to their family archivist in London, and she said, you know, we get all these questions about all the conspiracy theories, and we never talked about it. Because we can't prove it's not true. You can't prove a negative, you can't prove that the family doesn't own every Central Bank, except three, or five or seven, or whatever the meaning today is, you just have to put out there what you have done, and hope that the people who need to be convinced, convinced will listen, and of course they won't. So it seems like we get back to the beginning, you can't really refute a lot of this stuff. So you have to drill down to where does it come from? How does it spread? And why do people believe it? Right?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:11:15.000
    | text      = So I mean, I think a lot of people have a ton of different theories on where does it come from, you know, like, and you can draw it back? Say we go back to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, you know, that the the Russian propaganda, but that's not the beginning. You know, you go back further, and you get to blood libel. And that's not the beginning. You know, like, where do you think that this kind of, I suppose, I guess, the beginning of anti semitism comes from, you know, where does it really begin to you?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mike Rothschild
    | timestamp = 00:11:47.000
    | text      = Yeah, it really begins with recorded history, the Jews have always made a convenient scapegoat and objective blame for whatever group did not want them in the inner circle, whether it's the Romans, whether it's the early Christians, you know, whether it's the Turks, whether it's the Nazis, it's always kind of the same thing. It's, you know, the stories are told in different ways, it spreads faster, you know, the names change, the dates change, but ultimately, what you're looking at is an outgroup with their own costumes, their own language, they dress funny, they, you know, they they stay very insular, you know, we talked about what the Rothschilds, how they, you know, they kept their fortune in their own family line, you know, sometimes through some pretty extreme ways, including cousin marriage. And, you know, things that were we find abhorrent. Now, that was a really common practice, then it wasn't just the Rothschilds who did it?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:12:43.000

So as Jews began to face more restrictions, particularly in Europe, you know, they found themselves in certain professions. And one of those professions cheaply was money lending. And, you know, there was cat there were canon law, prohibitions on making money off of lending. There's all kinds of things about how metal can't be get metal, and all these these very obscure canon laws. So the Jews really prospered in these fields that prospered in money changing and making small loans and opening businesses, then as the Christians decided, we actually want to get in on that we want to make money, then suddenly, usury, which is the worst thing you can possibly do. Oh, no, that's just interest. But when the Jews do, it's still usury. And what's the difference? We have no idea. I

People don't ask themselves, the easy questions, the really simple, almost pedantic things that would falsify the vast majority of conspiracy theories, because people like conspiracy theories, people like blaming out groups, people like to have secret knowledge. So you don't ask yourself the very simple questions, because where's the fun in that? Right,

Over and over and over again, despite all of the other billionaires Historical royal families, all of those things, we're not going to be mad at the British Royal Family, we're going to be mad at the quote, Jewish royal family, the Rothschilds, that kind of thing. So, I mean, I suppose the best place to start with where that comes from is where did the Rothschilds originally come from? You know, and you know, I would hope you could talk a little bit about the beginning of the Rothschild family and that kind of mystique that they have.

And then I get a little bit later I get into some of the, you know, some history sort of leading up to the Second World War, because after that, it's just not that interesting. But the Rothschilds?

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mike Rothschild
    | timestamp = 00:15:52.000
    | text      = So the Rothschilds came from the Frankfurt ghetto, the Judean goddess. And there were, I think about 3000 Jews living in there, and it was basically squalor. You know, they're living in a essentially a walled ghetto. And they're only allowed out at certain times, and they have to bow and scrape before the Christians. But in that ghetto, you have a number of prosperous merchants and Mayer Amschel Rothschild was the son of a of a Jewish merchant who was sort of moving up in the world. And he, he actually went to rabbinical school, but he had to leave because both his parents died. So he moves back to Frankfurt, and he starts getting into the family business, which starts off with coins and metals. So he's dealing in rare metals, rare coins starting to make small loans start to get into textiles. And then at some point, he becomes the court Jew for the Crown Prince of Hess. So the son of the leader of hats, and this is, this is the Holy Roman Empire. So we're still 100 years before the before Germany comes together and the Holy Roman Empire has all these states, Frankfurt has a special status as a free city row. It's kind of its own enclave. It's very important in terms of trade and banking. And Mayor just moves up the ladder very slowly. He has 10 children, his five sons, you know, of course, we only really talk about the sons. Sure, sure, sure. I mean,

And Nathan Rothschild who's Mayor son becomes the he's in England by this time, he's moved to first to Manchester to get into the textile business. And this is the point where some of the Rothschilds son start going off into Europe. And of course, you hear all the conspiracies, mayor sent his five sons to the capitals, should a lot of them moved out after he died. You know, that whole timeline gets completely messed up by conspiracy theories.

There's a lot, a lot going on behind those two words. Yes. But yeah, get into in the book, but that idea of like, because there weren't, it wasn't supposed to be lending with interest, right?

    | text      = So you'll see a number of different terms for this court factor is a big one. But they basically weren't court Jews. They were Jewish bankers who were kept on in kind of an informal role by European royalty because they had access to money. And they had the ability to either borrow from other community members or loan at themselves. And you have extremely rich Jews, going back to the Middle Ages, who were the court Jews for European royalty. Now, they also were Jews, of course. And that meant they really didn't have any rights. So their status really hinged on the status of the Royal and if the royal was deposed, and the next guy doesn't want this guy around, well, you're not going to see him anymore. And a lot of them died completely destitute, a lot of them were arrested. There's a very famous court you sauce, the Jew, I think in the 13th or 14th century who was accused of sexually libertine activities with Christian women, and was executed horribly and publicly after after a show trial. That legend is repurposed over and over and over the Nazis really glommed on to it. So for these court Jews life is very precarious but while they were in the employ of their, their person, they had a lot of power. So mayor was the court due to the Crown Prince. And there were other courtrooms and other parts of the Holy Roman Empire. Right. And this was kind of the they were kind of the go betweens with the money.

Um, one of the things that that struck me, as I was thinking about it, is you're going through what amounts to hundreds of 1000s, you know, hundreds of years of, of this cycle of ebb and flow of anti semitism. You know, and one thing that I kept thinking of, oddly enough, is, I don't know, if you've watched MTBS, real world Road Rules challenge, I have not said don't worry about it. Okay. The only thing about it is that in the early part of the game, what gets me, what I can compare this to, is the first person who goes into elimination, the first person they all vote in, if that person comes back, then the next week, they're going to vote that same person in because all of the alliances, all of the powers that they've created have been built around the idea that they're already gone. Yeah. So so no matter how many times they keep coming back, in order to avoid conflict between the current alliances, that person keeps going back in an N and N, and the cyclical nature of the anti of anti semitism reminds me of that, because it appears that like, every time there's about to be a conflict of such huge proportions. The first thing that happens is they send in the Jews to elimination, so to speak. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. And it just keeps happening over and over again. Yeah. Because it's the path of least resistance for racism.

Some of it is Japanese people, especially in the 70s and 80s. We're looking at Jews as kind of a fellow oppressed minority, you know, the West is trying to take them down, they're trying to take us down, they don't want us to be too successful. They're spreading all kinds of theories and tropes about us, they did the same thing to the Jews, and there was a lot of fascination about Jewish business and Jewish wealth. But of course, that very quickly curdles into into blame into conspiracy theory. And of course, a lot of it is wrapped up with, you know, local culture and local conspiracy theories. You know, the the nuclear stuff is very big anti nuclear stuff is very big in Japan, and the teachers were blamed for that. So anything that you can blame on a Jew or a group of Jews, that's even just germane to your own culture is very easy to do that.

And this is the origin of the Waterloo myth. This is the myth where Nathan Rothschild was supposedly at the Battle of Waterloo watched the whole thing go down, knew that Wellington forces were going to win, but that a lot of people didn't think Wellington was going to win. So he you know, as the story goes, he takes a midnight horse ride to the channel port of Ostend in Belgium, pays terrified sailor 2000 francs to ferry him in a once in a century storm gets to the London Stock Exchange just in time and stands against his favorite pillar slumped over and looking defeated, and all the other bankers go Rothschild knows Rothschild knows we've lost the war as lost, they start selling all their bonds. You know, the the British consoles dropped by 95% or, you know, whatever the number is, and then Rothschilds agents, in a stroke of cunning by them all up. Suddenly, the news arrives, Wellington has won the day as Victoria's, those consoles shoot up in value. And suddenly Nathan Rothschild is the richest man in the universe. That story did not really exist until 30 years after the Battle of Waterloo, printed in this pamphlet by Satan. So that's kind of the thing that everybody does know about. And if you know anything about the Rothschilds, it's probably the Waterloo myth. But there's another story in that pamphlet. And it's blaming James de Rothschild for a train accident that took place just maybe a few weeks or a couple of months before this pamphlet came out. And it's a train derailment and I think 15 People die. This is this is the era where train travel is just starting become commonplace. There are a lot of train accidents. Somehow James and his cheapness and his depraved it and his indifference towards human life are all to blame for this horrible crash.

So every every uptick of anti Rothschild attacks, spills over into next one. And what I do in the book is I trace, every cycle up going into the next cycle.

It's always been, it doesn't matter. Because they're, you know, people don't go to church, and ask their pastor who wrote the Bible, who wrote down the words, it doesn't matter who wrote down the words, what matters is that we have the words and we can reinterpret them endlessly. But whoever, you know, hit that text on 4chan and hit post, that person doesn't matter. The interpretations of it matter. So the time that we waste arguing about all of this, and trying to trying to poke holes in our own versions of it distracts from the very real psychological aspects that these things tap into human on taps into the same stuff that the antiSemitism of 1840s France taps into, it moves at a different pace, you know, the stories told a little bit differently. But in the end, it's the same fears, the same hopes, the same need for villains and heroes and stories. And that is always going to be part of, of human human brains, and particularly Western political systems.

But I think what we can do with with a lot of this, and I think you can do it with, you know, sort of the micro with something like Q anon. And then the macro, it's something like anti semitism is to at least understand what it is, where it comes from, what its allure is, and be able to spot it in your own life and push back against it. So if you have that friend who's posting Facebook memes about international bankers, or they're parroting Kanye West, talking about 300, Zionists who run the world, you at least can know what that is. And you can say to that person, hey, that's, here's what this is, this is a really dangerous stereotype is really hurtful, you know, do better, for lack of a better term, and we can see it in ourselves. We can not share those things, we can not fall into those tropes in that easy blame. But the idea of converting the whole world at scale into, you know, getting rid of all of these things that have been in our culture for 1000s of years, that's probably a lot harder and a lot more frustrating.

And then we can work to overcome them in ourselves, find them and see them and other people, people in our lives work together as very, very small groups to understand where these things come from, and understand that the people who believe this stuff are not all crazy. You know, you don't not every person who listens to Infowars is a raving lunatic. Some are certainly, but most of them aren't. They're just looking for some kind of community of people who think they're going through the same thing. And maybe what we can do in the very basics is just build those communities again, you know, be outside with other people and stop thinking about how terrible everything is and how everybody's out to get us and you know me Maybe that can make our lives just a tiny bit better. And then things like anti semitism and q&a are not quite so appealing. After a while. I think things like anti semitism appeal to people who think everybody's out to get them and think that there is some other solution for their problems other than what they're doing. You know, maybe by rebuilding our sense of community and our sense of interpersonal relationship, we can make hateful movements and conspiracy theories, a little bit less shiny and a little bit less desirable.

It's not any individual person's fault, there was a pandemic, and there were lock downs, and the economy went to the shitter. That's not any one person's fault. But it's a lot easier for it to be one person's fault, or the World Economic Forum or Bill Gates than it is to look at how our economy works, and why we weren't providing more money for people to not to stay home, why we weren't giving more money to businesses that didn't steal it in PPP loans. There are real people to blame here. But that takes a lot of work, and a lot of societal soul searching.
