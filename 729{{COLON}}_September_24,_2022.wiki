Today, Dan and Jordan take a look at an emergency episode Alex put out on Saturday.  He had just fled from Connecticut, mid-trial, but what prompted that departure?  In this installment, this is revealed, and Bobby Barnes shows up to try to be a real asshole.

1:10:45 Alex lies about how he sued The Young Turks for defamation so he doesn't have to admit that he understands how he can be sued for 'defamation' despite the 1st Amendment's free speech protections.
