In November 2023, Project Veritas laid off almost all of its staff, effectively shuttering the organization.

Project Veritas was a nonprofit organization that claimed to focus on exposing corruption through undercover investigations. It gained prominence through the release of edited undercover videos targeting various entities, including media organizations, political figures, and social media platforms. These videos are often misleading, with past criticisms including misleading editing, criminal attempts to plant cameras and break into federal buildings, and unsuccessful attempts to solicit various crimes from subjects of their videos. This including attempts to solicit voter fraud in Colorado in 2014.

During the [[Covid-19]] pandemic, Project Veritas released videos endorsing false anti-vaccine narratives.
