But they know who's winning. They sat on the sidelines to the last minute. And now the Queen just flipped her dictator switch. Because the Brits did vote to get out of the euro. The Euro has been sabotaging things trying to sabotage that economy. And so she just dropped the trillion pound bomb on him. And, man, this is his story. All I gotta say so I'm gonna do my best when we come back to lay this out. This is gonna be spectacular. These alignments are real. The world is now in a bipolar structure. I don't mean that psychologically. That's what it's called. two fronts. and Russia, as usual, is going to be the wild card right in the middle.

And I got a bunch of cases of it today we'll be getting to a little bit later and I hate covering the stuff but the media isolates it suppresses it, and when a crazy white person and they're out there a bad white person goes out there and does something evil man it is the top story everywhere and every white person is guilty every white person is to blame collectively, like it was a mass shooting every gun owner is to blame when that's horse crap or when a Muslim runs over somebody you know 20 People with a car or 100 people in the case of nice France you don't blame the bus you don't blame the truck you blame who did it but they try to suppress when the Islamics do that so what it's open season on white people by the ruling globalist White, New World Order, wait because they want us all killing each other what but I have case after case like this crazy new shooting in Atlanta, I wouldn't want to air the video of the guy running around just randomly shooting women and you name it. And then smiling when he gets arrested. And it's so proud of all the people he just shot even led out by George Soros da after a bunch of crimes he committed, then you'd have this individual in Tennessee that kidnap the poor white lady teacher. I don't care if he's black or white. She's a human being took her raped her and tortured to death. And because he's black on white, they're suppressing the story. Can you imagine if a white dude kidnapped a black woman and went raped and murder it'd be on every channel everywhere and all whites will be to blame. So that is this division they're pushing.

    | text      = So first things first, Alex is just make up numbers when he says that the incidence of black on white racially motivated crimes has gone from 10 to one to 20 to one, that's just him pushing the white identity fear that essentially powers his shows ideology. Yeah, we've gone over this 100 times. So I'm not gonna get too deep into it again. But what Alex is doing here is just pushing a very standard white supremacist talking point that many view is one of the most effective gateways towards radicalizing people into deeper racism. Famously, it was lies about racial crime statistics put out by the Council of conservative citizens that Dylann Roof cited as being the thing that began his path toward carrying out his racist mass murder. There was a black man who was charged with the murder of a white teacher in Memphis. That's true, but it's not clear that it was a racially motivated crime. There was a black man who carried out a shooting spree recently. But that is also something that Alex can't prove how to racial motivation. He doesn't care about the actual crime. He just sees any crime where the perpetrator is black and the victim is white as happening because the victim is white. This is shockingly consistent in Alex's ideology over the years, and it's because he's a deeply racist person. Also to his point of whether or not you know, if there were white men who have kidnapped black women, and now if that did happen, it would be the biggest deal ever. I would ask him or most of the people in his audience if they know who Joshua Edwards is, and the answer is likely no. He was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, who kidnapped and raped a black woman in 2019 ultimately being sentenced in 2020. I've never heard Alex bring that up. I don't think that that is something that is been plastered all over headlines.

He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in late 2021 for kidnapping a 14 year old black girl who he had met online, taking her across state lines and sexually abusing her. Or Wayne Marcel who paid someone $2,000 to take that same child from fixe home in Texas to Illinois, where he picked her up and took her to Connecticut explicitly for the purposes of sexually abusing her. Here's the thing though, these are horrific crimes where the perpetrator was white and the victim was black. But even in the case where the guy was in the Aryan Brotherhood, you would have to work to prove that the crime he committed was motivated by race. It's possible and you might make that assumption, but it isn't guaranteed, even though he clearly is a racist. And these are cases that Alex has never heard of and fly directly in the face of the reality that he wants to portray for his audience. If anything he said meant anything these names would be household names, but they're not right. Yep. Anyway, Alex is just a racist, and he's pushing standard white supremacist talking point. I mean,

So some sweet little school teacher gets grabbed at gunpoint, in Memphis that will play her singing to her kindergarten students in a minute. She gets raped and murdered, and that's okay. And the media suppresses the story. It's disgusting. And when they question these guys, they say, well, she's a white person. She deserves it. I could play in the New Black Panther Party all day long in Houston. And in Chicago, and in Oakland, I got all the clips.

When Alex says that the story is being suppressed. What he means is that he's mad that the media isn't covering it as a crime committed by a black man against a white woman because she was white. This is also a classic white supremacist talking point that racist crimes against white people are intentionally being suppressed. Alex deploys these talking points because they're effective. And because he's racist. Also, that clip he's talking about from the New Black Panther Party, I believe, if I recall correctly, is a clip of colleague Mohammed who died in 2001.

And it shows how big our movement is, I think one of the things that the enemy wants us to believe is that we're isolated or that we're alone, or that, you know, the people that share our values in our worldview are very small a number, but that's actually the opposite is true. We make up you know, 80 to 90% of this country, and the elites in DC and in Silicon Valley. And in New York City, they make up the small percentage of people that are running this country right now. And their worldview and their values are diametrically opposed to us. And what we saw happening before we wrote this book was they were trying to subvert this term, Christian nationalism. What is Christian Nationalism means? Well, it means you're a Christian. And it means that you're a nationalist. What is a nationalist? neighbor is someone who loves their country. So you know, being a Christian nationalist is not a bad thing. In fact, you know, during our research of this book, what we found is that prior to the founding of this country in 1776, there were explicitly Christian countries for the first 200 years, with the early colonies.

He believes that atheists are secretly trying to dehumanize people from their connection with God. So there'll be tricked into transhumanism. He may believe that people in the US only have religious freedom because Christians are nice enough to let them but he doesn't want that to be the case. If given half the chance, he would almost certainly try to outlaw these religions and probably others, and it would be so easy for him to rationalize considering that he's super clear that his enemies are all in league with the literal Beelzebub.

    | text      = I do think that there's an interesting perspective that Chrissy is expressing here though, and the type of anti feminism that's coming through is a little bit troubling. According to her telling of this, she was into feminism in college, which she seems to characterize as her having short hair and not wanting to get married or have kids. That's fine, I guess. But I don't think that those things. Those are things that anyone who's being serious would consider central pillars of feminism. Yeah. Maybe you associated with some people who are feminists, I guess, but it's not the core. Yeah. Chrissy also expresses that she believes that women are easier to SIOP, which seems to imply that she herself was the target of this feminism SIOP and that she fell for it, which led to the behavior that she's describing in college. Thankfully, she's a comic so she hangs out with a lot of guys who are less easy to sigh up. Through hanging out with these cool dude comics who aren't targets of a psyop she was able to break free of the conditioning that led her to feminism. Honestly, it sounds like what she's describing as that she took on a feminist aesthetic in college and when she tried to get into comedy, that aesthetic was not popular with the men there. So in order to adapt and be accepted, she adopted a new aesthetic that was more socially approved. The way it sounds this really doesn't mean anything about the validity or the epicness of feminism. It's really just more about how many stand up spaces are heavily gate kept by dudes who don't like feminist Oh worst. Incidentally, along with these right wing ding dongs on her podcast that she's had the Subscribe, Like, Share, oh and Benjamin, right. Chrissy has also had a number of sex workers as guests and I would suggest that something she might want to do is reflect a little bit about why it is that sex work is growing in acceptance in the United States. What would the lives of the sex workers look like in a Christian nationalist country like the one the The person she's talking to wants to bring into being, what are the what are the things that you don't seem to think about a lot that are the fruits of the work of feminists over history,
