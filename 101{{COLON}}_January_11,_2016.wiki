Today, Dan tells Jordan about the day that Alex Jones first showed the indications that he had made the giant pivot from "supporting Trump" to "being a full-on Trump propagandist." Coincidentally (we're sure), Roger Stone happens to be a guest that day. Beyond that, Alex wrestles with how David Bowie's death is really about his CIA-Dentist father.
