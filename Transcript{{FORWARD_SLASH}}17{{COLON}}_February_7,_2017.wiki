    | text      = Hey everybody, Dan here, sitting in to give you a little bit of an introduction before we get into this episode, tell you what's going on here. What's going on is Jordan is busy this week real busy. He is way too successful at stand up comedy. And I have therapy one night this week, so we could not find a time to record. Luckily for you and for all of us. I have this episode that I'm going to release today that I recorded a week or two back with my friend, the very funny comedian Justin Kollek. And I'm excited to be able to release it for you. To give you a little bit of context, we recorded this episode A little while back, and I did not have the time to edit and re release the episode. And in the meantime, like right after Justin and I recorded this episode, when I was about to release it, we needed to me and Jordan needed to get back into the studio. There were emergency episodes that had to be done. And you know how it is. There's a forward momentum and a natural narrative that sort of taking shape with Alex Jones his life and you know, we can you as progress marches forward, we sometimes things get caught by the wayside. But I'm glad we have this opportunity now to double back a little bit and listen to this, because I think this episode is great. And I think you're gonna really enjoy it. And Justin is hilarious and fan tastic. But before we get to this episode, I have a couple things I wanted to get off my chest first, is a very exciting announcement that I'm not going to make now. What once Jordan does get back, we have a very exciting announcement to give you. And I look forward to telling you about that. And I don't know why I'm teasing it now. But who cares? Second thing, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that I may have been a little bit off in my interpretation of the last clip from the February 24 show, when I've listened back to it a number of times, mostly out of insecurity and fear that I had misinterpreted it. I think I might have. I think it's entirely possible that my analysis was off, literally off, but spiritually, I was not wrong. What do you says is still horrible. What he says is absolutely indefensible. You should never ever encourage people on Twitter to harass anybody, but especially about someone else's children. So no matter what the context of that is absolutely unacceptable. inexcusable behavior. But I am big enough man to recognize and publicly admit that I might have gotten some of the particulars about what he was saying slightly off, but to my credit, he does swallow some syllables in there. So I I'm, I'm on pretty solid ground, I think. Anyway. I don't feel better now that I've got that off my chest. But no, well, who cares? I am gonna feel better here in a moment because I've got this episode to share with you. I hope you do enjoy it again. Just thank you to everybody who's been getting on board. We really appreciate everybody listening, tweeting out. I'm sitting here on a dark and stormy night here in Chicago, and I've been waiting to do laundry all night and someone's been hogging the laundry machine. Only thing that makes me feel better about the fact that I have to go to work tomorrow and dirty clothes is the fact that I know that you guys are gonna be out there enjoying this episode. And that means a lot. So anyway, here we go. Let's get to the episode. But you know until Jordan gets back and we we we meet again. I'm just flipping policy Walkman.

Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host, thank you so much for joining us today, I'm going to get into all the news. And I mean, all of it coming up in the next segment. But first off, I want to talk about something that affects us all. And that's life and death. A lot of people I talked to never even get to meet any of their grandparents, much less all four of them. And my grandmother was almost 93 years old when she died this morning at about 130. And she was still cogent. A few days ago when I went and visited weather.

But the reason it's simple witness. I don't really cry for the 93 year old woman who I knew my whole life and love so much. And you taught me so much. I cry for the 30 year old woman who went and got the second round of polio shots when my mother was four years old, and her brother was nine years old, that paralyzed her and almost killed her and took her years to be able to walk again. As he was a beauty queen. And then I think about the SV 40 cancer viruses that were admittedly in that vaccine as well. And think about how they soft killed my grandmother. Way back in the

And I just think about how magic it is to have all these great ancestors and to know that I'll have progeny into the future and I'll be one of their ancestors. I just want to deliver for humanity and really build something beautiful and great.

She was very, very a few days ago, she'd be conscious talking about things be completely there and then just suddenly be somewhere completely else talking to her dead brother and talking to other members of her family. So she believes she was already in heaven. And I think about Colonel Craig Roberts, who was a Marine Corps sniper and veteran helicopter pilot investigator best selling author, Sniper one shot one kill, who expose Oklahoma City as an inside job and so much more in the murder of police officers by the Clinton mafia to cover it up. And he died for about 10 minutes on the operating table for colon cancer, and was there at the portal with the angel, the decision was made to send him back, they'd already walked off and he came back to life. And atheists and people that don't believe in God. And people that are in other cultures, they have that same, that same near death or death experience. So just know this. There's a lot going on in this world. But I just want my grandmother to know that I love her. And I appreciate her and I can still feel her presence now just like I can feel my first grandparents that went Jerry Jones, my dad's dead back when I was only six years old. And it's just good, I will carry them forward with me. I hope my children will carry forth my energy and my spirit with them, just as they carry my genetics. And so let's just all think about our fallen grandparents, and of course, our parents and everyone we love. But you know, most important thing to do is to reach out for the young today that are under all the GMO and all the chemical attack all the cultural attack and defend them because that's what really matters. He is the young.

And then they connect that to Trump and pretend that he's discredited hoping to split Trump off from his base. Now Trump knows they're doing this but they everyday say Alex Jones is Trump's brain. Trump is everything from Alex Jones. No, Trump has agreed with me on a few things that are overwhelmingly documented. Trump is his own person. I don't say that. Because I don't want to sit here and make the president mad. I say that because it's true. But clearly, they're trying to hurt Trump by driving him away from his base. It's not working, he's delivering in spades. But every day I see scores of these articles. Infowars is behind President Trump's idea that the media is covering up terrorist attacks, the Washington Post. Then they show headlines where myself Paul Watson and countless others live, but they only show screenshots. You can't go see it for yourself. It's a screenshot where we go show where police chief's the FBI, you name it are told to cover up the fact that Islamist is carrying out attacks just like San Bernardino. Now, the truth is Trump has trolled the media when he spoke at Central Command in Florida yesterday, at their headquarters, because he knows they'll bring all this out now and lose this debate.

Because, I mean, the argument could be made that the headline Infowars is behind the stuff using could just mean that they kind of they support the same thing that Trump does, right? Not necessarily the Trump got it from them, right. The word could be interpreted either way. So that's one thing. The other is that that list of unreported terrorist attacks, that was some shameful ship. You get a chance to go over that list. Oh, they misspelled San Bernardino. Oh no, they misspelled the word attacker, like 27 times. So throughout it when they were listing the attackers, and then a bunch of the bunch of almost all of it was covered by the mainstream media. And the ones that are dubious, maybe under covered were non fatality knife attacks in foreign countries.

So it's not like I was ever like, it's not like I escaped the church, or anything. Like I always was skeptical who didn't go, but it was interesting. It was always interesting. And mostly like, just like now is always entertaining. But it was this story about like, duck It was basically it's the gay shrimp story. Do you remember the gay shrimp story? This? I do not remember they were dumping chemicals into this river. And it was turning the shrimp gay and returning the actual shrimp in the shrimp in this river Labor Day? No. Well, here's the thing is it's based off real science that pesticides run off into the streams they have, what do you want to call it? estrogenic qualities and, and so much so that the small species only like a shrimp, it can actually flip their species female. So now all the shrimp are female so they can't reproduce so they die off. Okay, so now there's a genuine story that I remember hearing about in like biology classes in college about pesticides getting under like unreported their damages, and it's causing these problems and it could be causing to a tick in breast cancer in the human population. So he brings in a real kind of issue that is alarming and in undercover and under covered but he turns it into its turning the shrimp gay Of course, and they're doing this because they want to they're experimenting to turn us gay. Yes. So then we don't reproduce. And it's a form of eugenics that the globalists are going to use to keep population down and kind of trim population to like whatever their number one there's always that number, right? Like they want to get population down to 100,000 people.
