And the globalist understand this, they're all about control. They're all about knocking out the spark of creativity, controlling it dumbing us down. They're scared to death of you.

They don't want you ever to get on the field. They want you to shrink into obscurity, never effecting change, never being a decision maker never having power.

And what's the reason for that? Well, one of the side issues is counterfeiting, which the globalist do themselves with his fiat currency on by private banks, okay. But more importantly, it's about calling in the old money supply the money that's in the mattress, or that's in the bricks, fireplace, or that's buried in a tin can in a Folgers Coffee can in the back yard. That's what it does. And they said it's going to do that they can call in the old money, destroy it, take it out of circulation, which they admit they're doing, and then only have a limited amount. They're trying to go down from 3% actual paper currency or cotton currency, it's actually cloth compared to the ratios of zeros and ones in the Federal Reserve computer branch. Understand, if you all went to the bank and asked for cash, there's only 3%. Not even that much they claim 3% 3% Actual Cash, four zeros and ones on deposit with general depositors.

The only thing that would make sense if the goal is to bring in all the cash that's in the mattresses and then restrict the cash supply, there's no other way for things to have gone. Unfortunately, in 2021, there was over double the amount of physical bills and circulation then in 2003, according to the Federal Reserve, just from 2003 to 2004, approximately 400 million additional bills were added to the circulating pool.
