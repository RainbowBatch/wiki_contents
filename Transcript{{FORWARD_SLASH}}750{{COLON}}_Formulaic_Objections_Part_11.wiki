    | timestamp = 00:44:58.000
    | text      = So I have a theory the I have from the past couple of questions and answers and I feel like I might be on something here. So when David is talking about the things that are secret and proprietary trade secrets, I think he's specifically just talking about the profit margins they make on things that they sell and how much money the business brings in. This is the information that he and everyone at Infowars desperately doesn't want to be made public because if it does, that threatens the stability of what David has described as the primary business plan the company has. Their entire marketing strategy relies on the audience trusting Alex, they've been suckered into believing that they exist in this false reality where the globalists are coming to get them and the only hope they have is this lone, brave voice in Texas. He's on a mission directly given to him by God against agents of the literal devil and God has granted Alex discernment and insight into things that are beyond normal mortals. So when Alex tells you that you need water filtration systems to combat the globalist trying to poison you with fluoride, the audience is likely to believe that when Alex tells them that they need to take his special iodine to give themselves a higher IQ, which is only lower because the globalists have deprived them of iodine the audience buys in. If the audience has faith in Alex's shaken, these propositions would start to sound dumb, so it's pretty critical to protect Alex's image at all costs. Certain things are acceptable to acknowledge like Alex's problem with alcohol, because he can use that to appeal even more to the audience as an imperfect vessel doing the Lord's work. On the other hand, if the audience would actually understand the financial underpinnings of Infowars, and free speech systems, and they realize the scam Alex has been running on them for over a decade, it's a bit harder to defend. If the audience understood the millions of dollars, Alex takes out of the business for himself if they saw his ridiculous houses and lavish lifestyle. If they know what he spent on luxury, if they knew how high his profit margins were on the bullshit placebos that he sells them, that could have a high chance of eroding the trust that the audience has put in him. And without that there is no business. And I think that this is more or less, if you read between the lines. Yeah, kind of what David is saying,

So there's a couple ways that you could interpret that, that if people knew what their actual financial state was, it could lead to harm, you could think that that means like, well, if people knew how poorly they were doing, and that they were that close to the edge, that it would hurt them. But I don't think that makes sense. No, you could interpret it as if people knew how well they were doing. It could hurt them, because that could be used against them as a look at this pile of cash they have right. And I think that's a possibility. But actually, I think, taking this as a thought that branches off of the supplement conversation and stuff. I think that what he's actually saying is more to the effect of if they knew who we private labeled from, they could put pressure on them, and they wouldn't allow us to sell their product. Yeah. I think that that's more like what, what we're going at here, like because Alex knows that he can't take sponsors and stuff. Because unless they're like Mike Lindahl, or somebody who's like already super fringe and immune from any kind of pushback that comes from it. Yeah. And I have to assume that Alex is aware that some of these companies, if it were public, that he's private, labeling their products and selling them, they would terminate that agreement is, as opposed to withstanding the kind of criticism that they would get. I think that that's what David's saying in this.
