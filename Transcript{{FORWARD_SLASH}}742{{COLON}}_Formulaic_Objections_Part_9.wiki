And so at this point, as we come into the week, we still don't know what to do. Thankfully, we have depositions. Yay. So

And people enjoy it telehealth, inexplicably. So in the Connecticut case, Alex had four days of depositions. So we have that to cover. And that is impossible to do in the context of one episode. So today, we'll be talking about day one of Alex's deposition in the Connecticut case. And I should say, just to give some clarity for this, this is the deposition that he did after faking a illness do not go to Connecticut to sit for the deposition. Right? Right. Dr. Marbles gave him that weird diagnosis. And then it turned out he had a sinus blockage. You know, he had a little stuffy nose.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:07:45.000
    | text      = Another thing I should point out is that there's a couple of things that will become abundantly clear as we go through this. And one is that Alex hasn't learned anything from any of these deposition experiences he's had that sounds right. He's still evading and answering questions in ways that are like, well, maybe that made sense in the first deposition. Right. I've since been asked this question and told the answer, right. So you can't really say I don't know the time has packed a little silly. Yeah. And then the other thing is that Alex Hates Chris Maddie. It's very clear. I don't think that it would be fair to say that he liked mark. But he very seriously, Chris, Maddie. I'm not sure why. They clearly say that they have not met before. Alex is fucking mad at him.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:08:36.000
    | text      = Yeah, I could see that. I could see that. I think Mark has something that Alex begrudgingly is like, in another world. You know, that Perry Mason moment thing? You know, like in another world? I could see me you knew big Fred's that kind of thing.

    | timestamp = 00:08:56.000
    | text      = Yeah, it could be. I think I think it's more that I had to guess. I would guess that it's that Chris. Matty is much more of what appears to be a normal lawyer. Right, then then Mark. Mark has a kind of rogue ish. vibe to him. Yeah. Whereas Maddie is is Suit Tie lawyer. Right? And maybe Alex really hates that. Because he's sitting next to norm

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan

And so we're not going to deal with any of that, just because there isn't anything really to discuss. He has a house.

And I'm so I don't I don't understand how that stuff works. And I don't know why some people's text messages stay different different services, they're different. Used to, they would disappear a couple of weeks now they go back usually a while. So you're asking me, and it's really a technology issues. The same things happen on the other side, for sure. One person has text messages on their phone, but you don't have them. And I don't I don't understand anybody that has cell phones knows that they're different ones have different things. There's different things going on. And I don't understand it all. But but but as in the case of the emails, we should have just for cost of money been getting rid of them, but we had them going back 15 years, million 10s of millions, obviously, you guys were able to get those.

Alex's pronouncements about how much he cooperated are matters of certainty. he when he's rambling on his show, or when he's grandstanding at a disgraceful press conference outside the courtroom, but when he's actually forced to answer yes or no, if he has any idea what he actually did for discovery, he doesn't know anything. This is Alex's answer, because it's less of a problem than him saying that he intentionally withheld things, which seems like a far more likely situation to me at this point. Yeah. So yeah, it's it's good because you know, you have that DOJ have we turned over everything? Sure. What do you know about what you turned out?
