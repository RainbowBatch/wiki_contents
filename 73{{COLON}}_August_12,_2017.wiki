Today, Dan tells Jordan all about how [[Alex Jones]] responded to the tragic events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, VA. Not surprisingly, Alex's take on the whole situation, and who he thinks the bad actors in the whole thing, are not what you might hope, but they're probably what you'd expect. Also, Dan and Jordan accidentally descend into a prolonged debate about guns.
