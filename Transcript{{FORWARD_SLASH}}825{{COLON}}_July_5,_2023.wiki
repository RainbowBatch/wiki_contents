But let me tell you, that when you see headlines, because people are now reporting on this, that the W E F says fashion will be abolished by 2030. Quote, humans will all wear a uniform. These are real close from the UN and the W E F. Remember back in 2016 Welcome 2030 I own nothing, I have no privacy, and life has never been better. Now look how far they've brought us towards that just in the last six and a half, seven years? Not very. So here are some of the reports. The future of urban consumption, a 1.5 Celsius world C 40. Cities headline report. And this has been adopted as gospel by the UN.

    | text      = And we adopt that as gospel because Alex said it. So that was rough here again, read the name of the document. He's very clearly something like intimately familiar. Oh, this material. Yeah, so the document called the future of urban consumption in a 1.5 degree Celsius world. It's important to note, this wasn't a pop publication of the World Economic Forum, it was released by a group called C 40, which is an organization that includes member cities committed to trying to address climate change. It's International, and it involves people like Bill Clinton and Sadiq Khan, so it's globalist as hell. And it might as well be the WTE if it doesn't really matter. Yeah, people like Alex don't see any reason to distinguish as opposed to CB 40, which is Chris Rock's Climate Group, and Ub 40, which is purveyors of red red. Why? So the document is about how cities make up a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions that are put out into the atmosphere, and it seeks to explore ways that mayors and city leaders can use things like urban planning to reduce those emissions. The model they used to explore the issue was around consumption patterns. And one of the main categories they found where an impact could be made was in clothing and textiles, which is an area where there's a lot of waste apparently, in their section about textiles the author's set two levels of target for 2030, a progressive one and an ambitious one. The progressive target was eight new clothing items per person per year and the ambitious was three. This wasn't saying that the government is going to put in laws about how many clothes you can buy or force people to wear uniforms. It's a reflection of the changes that can be made by convincing people to voluntarily shift their consumption patterns. This happens over and over some Info Wars staffer finds a post about some new bombshell document on 4chan or telegram and Alex reports on it without reading it declaring it the Rosetta Stone the cracks open a globalist plan. It's a tired game, but I do at least appreciate that there's an attempt at using a primary source instead of a made up conversations Alex has with imaginary high level insiders, which is impossible to track down at least this I can go and read the report. Yeah,

So anyway, this, these two reports are like the big things that Alex wants to get to on this episode, but really doesn't. Yeah, so basically, the rest of this episode, a lot of the interplay is going to be him avoiding talking about this while talking about how important it is.

And then we'll play another clip of 96 as well. Where I'm on somebody else's show I forget who this person is talking Think about how governments attempt to take control when their control grid systems intentionally implode.

Before the UN assembly, he said, Today Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow, they will be grateful this is gonna raise the price. Today Americans would be out to get their in through the Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow they will be grateful. This is essentially through if they were told that there was an outside threat from me, whether real or promulgated as threatened our very existence. It is then it all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquish, for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government in the Kissinger's love, love, love. Let's go ahead and read what Thomas Jefferson said. The American people ever allow private banks ie the Federal Reserve, he had said that I said that the American people will turn to control the issue of our currency first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that grow up around them will deprive the people have all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.

Yeah, legend tells of a secret recording that this quote comes from that's never been found, and it's complete bullshit. The Jefferson quote is also not real, and it didn't appear anywhere in print until 1933. Alex thinks that he's playing this clip to illustrate how he's been right for decades, and his whole career has been this work of truth telling, but in reality, it illustrates something else altogether. This clip is a perfect encapsulation of how Alex's entire career has been little more than surface level charades, where his beliefs are based on flimsy foundations like consistently fake quotes. In the 90s, he was arguing about the evilness of his enemies with fake quotes. And in the 2000s, his movie and game is a little more than a patchwork of fake quotes. And the present day, this shit isn't any better or more grounded. What's supposed to be some kind of a victory lap is really embarrassing if you care at all about reality. Yes, thankfully, his audience doesn't. But the other thing too is like with Kissinger, you don't have to make up quotes.

And there are cases periodically Like for instance, they were eight cases in Florida in 2003. Yeah, this has become a hot talking point recently for folks like Alex, because there's currently four cases in Florida and one in Texas that appear to be local. At this point, there isn't really a good answer for exactly why these cases popped up. But there's some pretty decent theories that don't involve we're about to be hit by a flood of malaria thanks to Bill Gates, supposed mosquitoes. There's like weather patterns that are more advantageous to mosquitoes. Sure, sure. Sure. There's, you know, longer summers, hotter temperatures, more rainfall, those kinds of things. And there's an interesting theory that I was reading that had to do with the malaria could be He kind of people could be asymptomatic of it or it could be like a really mild case, they get bit by a mosquito now the mosquito has it can give it to somebody else. Maybe that's bad, or there's also some people who are thinking that some COVID ideas and the the awareness of being ill being possibly more serious, could have led to these people who have been diagnosed with the malaria right, even knowing that they had it to begin with. Right. So I don't know, it's it's interesting, but it does, it has happened periodically. I don't think it's anything to be too panicked about right now. But it is something to be aware of.
