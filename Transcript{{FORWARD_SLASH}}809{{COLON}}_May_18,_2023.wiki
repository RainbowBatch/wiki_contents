Okay, I was I got a confidential letter in the mail one day while I was in college, and it was from the like, disciplinary office or whatever. And like my being in college was under review. Someone had complained about me to the disciplinary board because of something I had written in the campus paper. Yes, yes. And so I went to the meeting with a friend of mine pretending to be my lawyer because I just made a big big joke out of the whole thing. Yeah, to confidential letters was trying to get me kicked out of school, really. And so I found the letter I actually still have the letter, not the first letter, but I got I still have the second letter that was the guy saying, we are so sorry, you did not do anything wrong. I saw that I was like, Oh man, it's nice when you have little things that like reminds you that your past isn't like embellished or you have stories that you tell over and over again at bars and stuff like you start to question some of the specific details.

You know, I think a fair criticism could be made that we have not paid much attention to the present day. I think a lot of that has to do with it being kind of repetitive, a little bit boring. A lot of the time, it certainly inflammatory dangerous. Not to say that there isn't bad stuff going on. But a lot of it ends up being retread territory, and what have you. And so it can be a little bit frustrating. But that said, I think that there is an argument to be made that we need to do a little more in the present day.

    | text      = I was really excited to track these eight stories and see what the connective tissue was, like see if we could really learn slowly but he gets to two and just gives up. Yeah. So one of the constantly Teachers of Alex's show is him saying that various things were total secrets that no one talked about before except for him. But now all of a sudden the media is talking about this thing. And that in and of itself is a story. The message the audience is supposed to get from this is that the media is covering it because the globalists have told them to, because the globalists have to follow Alex's bizarre cosmic law system, where before they do something evil toward the population, they have to give a cryptic warning about it. So if we don't stop them before doing it, it's our fault because we had the freewill to stop them. In almost every instance of this, the thing that Alex is pretending was previously a secret had been talked about widely before. And he's just lying about the new news item in order to make it fit his mold as he's doing here. This cosmic universe law thing is really stupid. And what kind of universe do we live in where the victim of an atrocity is to blame for it being done to them because they didn't stop it. If someone with a gun confronts you in an alley and says, I'm going to kill you, that technically is a warning. They're signaling their intention. And at that point, you have the freewill to try to stop them. The fact that you had that warning, doesn't make it your fault when the person then shoots you. But I guess that's how Alex views the cosmos. Yeah,

    | text      = No, I was also thinking about this a little bit more. And I had a realization, Alex's greatest fear is a one world government, but by him believing in this weird intergalactic law system, he essentially believes in a one universe government that extends beyond our plane of existence and possibly beyond death. This whole idea is that if there's a one world government, there'll be nowhere you could go that wouldn't be under their control. And yet his own ideology involves a far more inescapable system of control. I just thought that was strange.

So it wasn't immediately obvious what the story that he was talking about was, but it's an article from the Infowars website titled quote, ADL ran an extensive multi dimensional counterintelligence operation to destroy the John Birch Society. Okay. This is a reposting of an article from information liberation, which is another very Infowars ish outlet. Yeah. This article is in turn re reporting on an interview that the Jewish telegraphic agency did with a historian named Matthew Dallek, who has a new book out called birchers How the John Birch Society radicalized the American right. In researching the book, he found records in the archives of the American Jewish Historical Society in New York that detailed how members of the ADL had infiltrated the John Birch Society, and were able to use their insight information to help expose the real character of the JBS and how much of a threat it posed to a civil democratic society. Right. Alex can be all upset as much as he wants about how members of the ADL infiltrated this group. He loves and showed the public how they were organized around ideas like opposition to civil rights, but his claims that they were some kind of Gestapo are working with the government to take down JBS figures. It's just not true. Also, the ADL isn't bragging about this. The entire story is about a historian who wrote a book uncovering this chapter in history. The ADL itself isn't even involved. This is the second headline. And so far, both of them are articles that Alex is completely misreporting. All right. And we're not going to get more

Also, it's not from the National Archives, which is a federal agency within the government. These documents are from the American Jewish Historical Society. Right, right. Alex hasn't read this store. And he's just making up details. So you end up with this kind of sloppiness and like, wish fulfillment. This is what he wants the story to be, but it's not Yeah, to put into sharp focus what's going on here. There's a historian who wrote about some documents he found in these archives. These documents related to how some members of the ADL took it upon themselves to infiltrate the John Birch Society in the 60s because they felt that what the JBS stood for was a threat to our democratic system, and in turn a threat to populations like Jewish Americans. Alex's taken an article that is editorializing on an interview with that historian and is reporting that these documents revealed that the ADL has been infiltrating these groups and false flagging them by being racist. So the right wing groups get a bad name. Alex is just making that up because he wants it to be true. He likes these hate groups, but doesn't want the responsibility of publicly accepting that the group's he likes are full of racists and bigots, so he pretends that those elements of his world are just fake. To be clear, I read this chapter and Alex book about the birch watchers as they called themselves, and nothing Alex is saying is defensible at all. Dallek even does concede that some of the tactics the ADL used may have been illegal. But illegality was in the form of spying on members of these right wing groups, including digging up financial information that they may not have had the right to access. Dallek says quote, the activities honored by the birdwatchers were generally neither as nefarious as the society's critics alleged nor is innocent, as its defenders claimed. So in the process of their spying, they didn't uncover crimes and the meetings weren't full of ravenous bigots, but they documented how quote anti semitic and racist ideas and language were endemic to the society from the beginning. Before it started recording the wrong kind of attention. The society made no attempt to hide its clear ties to outnet white supremacists as the birdwatchers documented the racism flourished at the top receiving an official say sanction that helped legitimize the very notions the society claimed it to test it. They spied on and then rely relayed much of that information that they found to the media in an attempt to give people a picture of who the JBS really was. They weren't false flagging anybody. One passage in the chapter of Alex book really resonated with me. It's talking about the birchers, but it really is so true of the position Alex exists in as well. Quote, defending a white supremacist in one breath while denouncing white supremacy in the next underscored the dilemma that society didn't want to alienate more tolerant conservative members, or hardliners, it feared the critics would use charges of racism to discredit the movement. But it wasn't always able to hide its darker impulses and associations. Sometimes it was those darker forces that revolted. And that's the same kind of bind that Alex finds himself in. Yeah. So anyway, Alex is just lying about this story.

And so state by state, they had like a number of lists of people who would like, you know, their licenses revoked, right.

In this case, it's an audio recording of two people alleged to be a nurse and a pharmacist. One of them if you just listen to the audio, it's unclear which one of the people it is Jeff says that they felt that the hospitals were killing patients that to a specific doctor had housed on a particular floor because of the way that they were providing care to these COVID pay.

They plan to pretend that it was a bad virus and a big deal so they could force everyone to get vaccinated. And part of that, I guess, involved planning to have these kill floors in hospitals, right where patients would go and be given treatments the doctors knew would kill them in order to exacerbate the hysteria around COVID. And trick more people into getting vaccinated. Sure the globalist wanted everyone to get vaccinated because the vaccine secretly were another bio weapon, and they're going to kill off most of the population. Wait, that's where it falls.

When you get people that I personally know whose mother or father or brother or sister would go in with a bad cough in trouble breathing, and they wouldn't give them drugs wouldn't get permission, just go home, take some aspirin, don't they couldn't breathe, they come back and put them on a ventilator. And there was shame thing and every Western country, on average, the equivalent of $53,000, to put somebody on a ventilator, another 12 grand if they died, that's not enough money systems. We're getting more than $60,000. That's not a lot. No matter where you are. It's the same in the UK and Australia. Same here. Same program. Shamy. Oh, you can't see your loved one. Well, they weren't letting the nurses and doctors that normally work there. They were telling them, oh, we're not doing regular care right now at these key hospitals. Remember, those hospitals closed? You go there, no cars are there, but they show you Oh, it's so busy. There's people in hazmat crews or you don't come to the hospital. We can't do that elective surgery. We can't even see people that have had heart attacks. And they had messages your COVID so bad, the hospitals are so overwhelmed. Orders went out all over the world. Do Not Resuscitate someone with a heart attack to an ambulance because we don't have the staff because they sent them home.

    | text      = and whiskey. Yeah. Next point, I've never seen Alex present a case of someone who was healthy, put on a ventilator and then died because of the ventilator. This is something that's become solidified as rampant during the early days of the pandemic in Alex's mind and in their conspiracy, the information space, but it's never more specific than vague anecdotes. Alex is just making up that all these countries were paying hospitals to put people on ventilators. Different countries have different health care systems. So this doesn't even make sense. The conspiracy is based off a willful misrepresentation of the amount that Medicare compensated hospitals for providing specific care. That original conspiracy didn't include bonus payments if people die so I guess that maybe has been dug up. Figured out since then. I think they added that one I find I probably just missed that post on Steve Kirsch is dumb is substack probably this is an old conspiracy. That is complete bullshit. But I guess Alex wants to hold on to it so we can get some more use out of it. Alex is really fudging details about the early days of the pandemic here, too. They weren't telling nurses not to come in. If anything, they were telling everybody to come in and stay forever. Yeah. You remember when people were banging pots and pans for the health care workers and stuff. Alex and Infowars tried to get on board with the hot conspiracy narrative at the time about hospitals secretly not being fooled. But even Paul Joseph Watson told Alex to stop it and said that it was like Sandy Hook all over again. Yeah, orders did not go out to not orders didn't go out to not resuscitate people who had heart attacks all over the world. I'm not sure about places like some areas like Italy or something where there were like localized really severe circumstances, I don't want to I'm gonna only say this about the United States that this did not happen. Sure. Alex is exaggerating this based on a New York Post article about New York telling EMTs to not risk exposure by tending to people who've had a heart attack. And part of this is due to the nature of how you have to attempt to resuscitate people in that state. Part of it had to do with PPE shortages early on in the pandemic. And another part of it was likely due to the fact that survival rate for out of hospital cardiac arrest cases is approximately 5%. According to the American Journal of Emergency Medicine. I'm not going to defend New York's decision here, but it is worth noting that this policy was announced on April 21 2020, and was rescinded on April 22 2020. mere hours later, great. You definitely wouldn't understand this context from just listening to Alex's foggy memory embellish shit. All this is nonsense, and it doesn't match reality, but it matches the feeling that Alex's audience has about reality. This feels like how things are. So Alex is amping that feeling up and using that feeling to feed into his current narrative that the hospitals were death camps with kill floors. Yeah, good luck documenting all this though. That should be that should be. That'll be tough. Quite a task.

The article is based on an interview with that historian Matthew Dalek, he reviewed documents in the process of writing this book, but these documents themselves aren't in the article. Also, it's not the ADLs scholars or something. But yeah, second problem. It's not about the ADL constantly and consistently infiltrating every right wing group for the last 60 years. It's about the JBS in the late 50s and 60s. Third problem birdwatchers did often pretend to be racist, so they could fit in with the other members of the JBS, but there's no indication of a single person who pretended to be racist in order to cause a scene to make the JBS look bad. From reading that chapter and dialects book and reading as much JBS Mateen cereal as I have no one needed to make them look bad or bigoted, they took care of that themselves like, on purpose and for fun. Oh, yeah, yeah. Fourth problem the ADL and quote their scholars, whatever that's supposed to mean aren't reporting the story because they're proud of anything that doesn't even meet make any sense. Doesn't mean anything to Alex book came out a couple of months ago and a Jewish news outlet interviewed him about the intersection of the ADL and the John Birch Society, who his book is mostly about.

    | timestamp = 01:21:05.000
    | text      = So nothing Alex just said could convict anyone? Nor does it even point in any way towards a conspiracy. If this conspiracy is true, then there was this grand plan to put people on ventilators and give them some medication to kill them. If that's true, then why did the ratio of COVID patients receiving treatment including ventilators, why was it so low? And why did it drop pretty much consistently as the pandemic went on? This is an opportunistic exploitation, Alex and Rennes are engaging in where there is a fact, which is that people who had COVID and were treated with a ventilator had a higher death rate than would have been expected. The explanation for this fact is pretty simple. COVID cases where ventilator is necessary are going to be the more severe cases with patients in more deadly situations. And regardless of why you're using a ventilator, you run the risk of being exposed to a secondary infection. These are not complicated things to understand. But instead of accepting reality, Alex and Rand's glom on to these deaths, and use this tragedy for their own enrichment and to propel their conspiracy worldview, the higher rates of death among people who are on ventilators was because there was a concerted plan from the government to kill citizens for vague nefarious reasons, and doctors went along with it and killed their patients, because they wanted the $50,000 from Medicare reimbursement 50k This is stupid shit. And these people are not only worth not taking seriously, they're worthy of derision. There are people who are unfit for polite society, and they're willing to dance around with these stolen corpses for profit. Fuck these people. Yeah, just to show my work. Here is Alec specifying what drug he's talking about when he says they're put on ventilators and all these drugs. All right, this is from a little bit earlier,

And they would kill them with that knowing that if you give somebody even a small amount of this, they can't breathe, number of prescriptions for the drug medazepam doubled during height of the pandemic. And right before the UK government ordered the biggest stockpile ever of it. And it goes on from there it goes

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 01:23:19.000
    | text      = on. So to be clear, Alex's alleging the whole narrative here is that 139 US hospitals have killed floors where they would put COVID patients on ventilators and give them the sedatives and I'm guessing that that based on what he's saying that is how the right right annex of the murder and logistics. Yeah. And so he's propping this up with a story about prescriptions going up for a sedative in the UK and the UK stockpiling. It doesn't make sense. Yeah. But also this conspiracy just doesn't work. There was a large increase in prescriptions for medazepam in April 2020 In the UK, but this was a specific type of prescription. This was out of hospital prescriptions. So it was being it was not being given at all to people on ventilators, right? No one has a vent. They're not on a ventilator outside of a hospital setting. And these prescription increases were out of hospital prescription. Right. No one knows exactly, for sure. But the prevailing theory is that this was for elderly people who were in a lot more pain, right? Due to COVID. And the circumstance that makes sense. Some theories have floated around about assisted suicide, but nothing has been established on that and there's no evidence to prove it. Yeah. The claim that the UK had the largest ever stockpile of midazolam is something Alex is just taking from David Icke. In reality the UK did have a stockpile of it as they did have many like adequate Yes,

But she's asked me to speak for her publicly because she is she, first of all, she wants to make sure she's not saying anything that's going to damage her lawsuit. And second of all, she wants to make sure that she's not looking for fame or fortune. She just, she's a mom of five. She's got a PhD in pharmacy. Stanford educated one of the one of the most qualified qualified pharmacists I've ever ran across. I mean, the woman is a brilliant pharmacist. And that media name is a draining and she is she comes for that. She says, Listen, I you know, I'm a pharmacist. I'd worked in clinical trials with Big Pharma that said another I wanted to get back into patient care went back into that. And while I was at the hospital working during COVID Did you know I was looking at the drugs they were using and I felt that their protocols created an opportunity to hasten death. Now hasten death is a, it's a term that's used, but don't legally speaking. If I shoot you in the head, I'm hastening your death, right? It's a polite way as though killing someone. Doesn't matter how you hasten death, hastening death is still killing someone. Right? So she said, they wanted me to sign off on these protocols that I thought were going to hasten death, or that had the potential to cause death. I said another I said, Well, okay. She said, Well, I applied for a religious exemption, because I didn't think that was right. And they ended up firing her and retaliating against her. So I want you to understand what I just said, Alex, In plain terms. You got a PhD super high end quality educated pharmacist. What does that credential does anybody on the planet in a hospital says to the hospital, your policies could result in patients dying? Can I have an exemption from supporting these policies? And instead of the hospital saying, oh my god, they could we need to change these policies, or at least reevaluate them. Instead, hospital fires are in retaliates.

I was wondering like, at this point in the episode is wondering why the headline was for the 139 hospitals. And it turns out like I said, That's how many are run by ascension. They're literally accusing the ascension network of hospitals of all having killed floors. Yeah, based on what I can only describe very generously as paltry evidence.

Okay, eight days? What are their kidney numbers? What is it? What is the respiration? Are they on the vent? How long have they been on that? I could ask a series of questions. And I could tell you and predict with 90 plus percent reliability despite the fact that I'm not a doctor, how many days they had before they were dead.

He lacks a lot of the charisma that Alex has, and Stu can't just ramble about nothing for an hour like Alex can, but there are some similarities. They're both insane right wing extremists who are obsessed with the devil. They both make a living skimming headlines and then amplifying and worsening whatever idiotic shade is popular on conspiracy leaning social media, but there's similarity. The other one is that Stu Peters is a bit of a filmmaker like Alex used to be ah, many people have heard of his film died suddenly, which is a load of shit attempted a documentary that argues that people are dying suddenly from the COVID vaccine. That movie was so bad and poorly researched that even some COVID conspiracy theorists have panned it. Wow. One of his main sources in that film is frequent past Infowars guest and substack idiot Steve Kirsch Also fun fact Stu has contended as recently as this month that NFL player Damar Hamlin is an example of someone who died suddenly, despite the fact that Hamlin is very much still alive.

He befriended the then governor and former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura is on Tyrell Ventura sounds right in an effort to land a part in a short film he was working on. Stewart was welcomed into the governor's inner circle. In fact, according to a 2002 AP report, he lived in the governor's mansion until A background check revealed that Stewart wasn't the Hollywood insider he claimed to be wild. According to this AP report, the police felt that Stu didn't pose any threat to anyone but he booked quote has several active warrants for his arrest in connection with small offenses.

Although he was not a cop. The Goodhue County Sheriff told the AP in 2015 that quote, anybody would think this guy is a cop. He's very much crowding or blurring the line with impersonating Yeah, still responded quote, If the concern is that the everyday Joe is gonna mistake one of our squad cars as a law enforcement vehicle. My question is, so what? In today's climate of law enforcement there are two sides the good guys and the bad guys were the good guys. Minnesota did not agree and partially because of stew they passed the state law forbidding bail bondsman from quote, using certain colored uniforms or vehicles with emblems that the public might mistake for law enforcement. There was also a slight concern that Stu was posting a lot of his exploits on social media and YouTube, and may have been trying to get himself a reality TV show, which seems like something he would do.

He attacked the ADL after they complained about his attack on Soros. It's pretty simple. The only thing that complicates things is the delusion that Musk is a genius.

There's no point in supporting a candidate because it's all bullshit. Voting doesn't matter. Going to your local board meeting doesn't matter. It's all theater. The idea of a democratic republic is bullshit. Stu is being very clear about what he means. Yeah. And Alex's takeaway from that is that the Republicans are being weak and that talking points are staged whatever that means. This Isn't what Steve was saying. And I think there's two primary reasons Alex has to do that little sleight of hand for the audience. The first is that Alex has now seen how ridiculously profitable it is to play around with partisan politics, particularly in intense general elections, one of which is coming up next year, he may have started his career rejecting the two party system as a sham and ignoring elections. But that was then and this is now to go back to that rejection would be to abandon the ability to rally the audience around a strongman leader, which is a really lucrative game. And Alex has discovered that so lucrative. The second thing that I think is Alex is smart enough to realize that if all politics is bullshit, and we are currently living under an occupied government that plans to kill everyone, then there is no peaceful solution left, there's literally no excuse he can give to not be involved in insurrection, because in essence, the info war is over. Or at very least, the info war is only useful as a recruitment tool and a propaganda arm for the people participating in the actual war, which would be an actual war, right? Alex loves to play around with ideas that the war is right around the corner, but he desperately doesn't want it to actually be here, because immediately his position disappears. He knows that once shots start flying, he has to either urge people to be reasonable and not fight which will likely get him branded as a traitor by his own community, or he has to emphatically support the insurgency. And I think he knows you'd be arrested immediately in that situation. Yeah, Alex only has a state to exist in. Well, the coming Civil War is inevitably right around the corner yet never arriving. Any other state of affairs is a is just not going to work. For him. It's a net negative,

In recent years, the political Institute influential Q anon cult is formed around anonymous online texts, known as Q drops. Now followers of this cult, which are millions now in the US in the rest of the world, collected, reviewed and interpreted these cue drops as some kind of new scriptures as a sacred text. Now, to the best of our knowledge, all previous cue drops were composed by human beings, and both only helped to disseminate these texts online. But in future, we might see the first Cults and Religions in history, whose reviewed texts were written by a non human intelligence. And of course, religions throughout history, claimed that their holy books were written by a non human intelligence, this was never true before this could become true very, very quickly. Whoa,

What are you talking about lately, and an extinction level event that will be replaced by AI bots and robots? But that is really shocking to listen to and people just say, you know, well, that guy is just crazy. Everything that this guy says he fully intends on carrying out everything that these people say, The criminals are telling you what they have to do. It's part of their satanic religion. It's part of their double horn and worshipping that they have to tell you what their plan is they have to telegraph and protect and tell you learn.

That is not the way that they responded to it. And I would say that if they wanted to get mad at him saying that other holy books weren't derived from non human intelligence, they could that could be an issue. That would be a response where they could be mad, and it would be responding to something that actually said, agreed, the rest of that was not related.
