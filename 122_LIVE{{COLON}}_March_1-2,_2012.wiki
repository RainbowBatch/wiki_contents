Today, Dan and Jordan go live at the Playground Theater to discuss the March 1-2, 2012 episodes of The Alex Jones Show. The gents break down how Alex responded to the news that Andrew Breitbart had died. We all cope with loss in our own way, and Alex apparently copes by lying a whole lot and spreading conspiracy theories about the deceased.
