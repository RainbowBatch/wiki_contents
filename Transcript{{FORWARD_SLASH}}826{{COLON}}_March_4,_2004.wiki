So I was going through, bam, dot video, not Alex's website do as poking around in there seeing what's going on? Because, you know, sometimes they'll have weird channels pop up. Yeah, there's the next wentest channel that but whatever. Yeah, still there. I think it's inactive. That sounds right. But I noticed they have a best of Tucker Carlson channel.

    | timestamp = 00:09:50.000
    | text      = Yeah, I don't know if we need to. So you know, there's this sort of dull period and then we get to this and it's just just shit just bad. But one of the things one of the narratives that he's been going over during this dole period, quite a bit is that there's a new trend that people have been doing which is putting money in microwaves. I don't know if you remember this. So the new money what the new money that came out, you certainly had the Yeah, it has the strip in it for like, not being able to. Pirate it. counterfeiters. Yeah. So piracy. It's piracy, piracy, and it's not not by Rosie. I don't know why that was the word that came to mind. But yeah, people so people were putting in money into microwaves because that that would flicker and like set on fire. And so conspiracy theorists are like, this is the RFID chip being put into the money, man. They're tracking your bills.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:10:52.000
    | text      = Okay. So people microwaved money for a while. Yeah, it was a little bit
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:10:57.000
    | text      = of a fad. And then people were coming out and be like, don't put your money on them. Like, that shouldn't be a conversation, but that's fine. It's dangerous. Yes. And then other people were like, using microwaves to clean money. They thought that that would be like get stuff off? Sure. Sure. Show. There's a lot of that going on. And to Alex's weird, weird been covering this a bit. And apparently, it's really exciting because Steve Watson and Paul Joseph Watson's brother, right, also put some euros in the microwave.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:11:33.000
    | text      = I mean, it makes sense. If you're like a third grader just coming off your favorite science class, just be like, let's find out what happens when you do everything different. Sure,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:11:42.000
    | text      = sure. But that third grader is going to then ask why did this happen? That is true. And then find the answer, as opposed to people like Alex, who are just like, it's the global. So you might get some sense from that. Why that was a dull period of a couple of days. Yeah. But I was excited for this where Alex talks about how sensational stuff like putting money in the microwave gets more attention than other stuff he talks about. Yeah, yeah.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Alex Jones
    | timestamp = 00:12:12.000
    | text      = I mean, now there's a big debate are there RFIDs in the money, I think the fact that the money exploded, or pop like firecrackers is just an illustration of madness, or some weird money. I mean, it's really a novelty. But people latch on stories like that. I mean, we will post a photograph and I don't get a million viewers, and then, you know, some government document from the Library of Congress about how the government engineered aids and they say they engineered it in 1968, or 1975. And they say it's a soft kill weapon, and they describe it, we post that and it gets, you know, 10,000 people look at it in a month. So, this also speaks to what captures people's attention. And it certainly images, you know, loading towers with jet liners flying into them, you know, that gets people's attention. That's what I mean. And so somehow we've got to shift our minds into, you know, really becoming upset about bills and legislation and things like that. Because if we could get people as excited about the Patriot Act One and two, and what's in it as we could about exploding $20 bills. Then we wouldn't get this country back. But but people liked visual things they like. They like sports, they like gladiatorial diversions.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:13:37.000
    | text      = So on a descriptive level, Alex is right about the the dynamic that he is describing, essentially, that sensationalism sells, he's accurately assessed a problem with how human attention operates. And at this point, he's at least pretending to want to solve that problem by encouraging people to pay attention to the more boring, less sensational stories that are actually possibly more substantive. But we know how Alex's career has progressed since then. And I think that this frustration that he's discussing, it might have played some part, possibly even subconscious as a part in his path. Instead of trying to get people to pay attention to the bills and legislation and things that matter. Alex went the entire other direction, turning his career into a near constant barrage of empty, meaningless spectacle meant solely to capture people's attention and keep them stuck in that, like, Look at this $20 bill in the microwave. Yeah, yeah, he's aware that that $20 bill in the microwave doesn't mean anything. No, this is just something that's visually interesting to people. That's a weird money.

If you were gonna go ahead and read those bullshit articles about non existent bills and stuff chair that he's talking about that is dry. Yeah, that is not really all that interesting.

He also even discouraged people from getting tested. He was working for a company that sold the vitamins in the capacity of running fraudulent clinical trials aiming and proving the vitamins efficacy, which the South African government would later declare illegal. Here he is on Alex's show discussing the story about the Child Protective Services supposedly running illegal drug trials on children, all the while he's running illegal drug trials in South Africa. Also, as recently as 2006, it was reported that he advised people that HIV quote cannot be transmitted between heterosexuals. So this guy is an expert. I,

    | text      = and and a lot of times, you aren't getting the help that people should be providing No. Yep. So the underlying story here that Alex is covering is about a New York Post article involving research and care that was done with foster children being given HIV AIDS medication. They weren't given it for no reason, as Alex and his guests may want to suggest these were all kids with HIV AIDS, and many of them were severely ill and wouldn't have had access to any treatment outside the program due to financial hardship, right? The whole thing gets a little bit messy, so I'm going to try and sum it up as concisely as I can. This story got some traction here around out this point 2004. And then in 2005, the BBC put out a special called the guinea pig kids that stirred up a lot of public concern. In response, the Vera Institute of Justice launched an investigation of the claims made in that documentary, and got to the bottom of it. This all had to do with this program at the Incarnation Children's Center in New York. And ultimately, 532 of these children were involved in trials of approved medications. Like for instance, they were approved and tested but not on children, right, necessarily right. After quote, interviewing dozens of people involved in the trials and reviewing hundreds of 1000s of pages of case files, documents and correspondence, the Vera Institute announced the conclusion of their work in 2009, they found that no children died as a result of the medications they were given. They found that no foster children were removed from their families, because they wouldn't consent to treatment, which you can hear Resnick assert here, and that is one of the big things they hang their hat on in terms of their claims, of course, and then also rasnic is a bad source on this stuff, because he thinks that just giving appropriate medication for HIV or AIDS is actually hurting these, these children. So that's, that's something that isn't even unpacked on Alex's show, which is a very important variable in terms of having this person as a guest. Yeah. So yeah, I will say the investigation did come up with some concerning points. It's not this story is not entirely without some criticism. Sure. For one thing, they weren't able to find the official consent forms for all of the children who participated. The New York Times does know that quote, the State Department, the state's Department of Health refused Vera's request to review medical records, which might have included some additional consents. That's an open question. And also they found in some cases, consent forms that were hand written, which isn't in line with policy, but could indicate informed consent was given Share, share share, pretty inappropriate away to a

And so all of the stuff that they're talking about here on Alex's show and shit, nonsense, yeah. Incidentally, even before that full investigation concluded, the BBC was forced to make a big public apology about that guinea pig kids special. They were roundly criticized for distorting facts, and strangely only presenting the viewpoints of notorious aids denialist it should shock nobody at this point for me to reveal that one of the experts that was interviewed on that show was David rasnic, the pile of shit who's talking to Alex here in 2004. So he is on to talk about a story that he's misrepresenting and doing a very, he's played a big role in MIS covering. Yeah. And, and gaining attention based on those like erroneous claims.

One of the big things that magic stresses in almost all of his interviews is that he is not cured, and that his condition is as manageable as it is because of the medications he takes. He's not said that he's fine and doesn't need the drugs. But he has trimmed down on the amount of medication he needs to take. And his HIV viral load is at an undetectable level again, because of his medication, which he's very clear about. In a frontline interview magic did in 2011, exactly 20 years after he made his big public announcement about contracting HIV. He discusses his experience with medication. Magic has asked if he ever had any side effects, and he replied, quote, I never had any side effect. I'm one of those. And I think what helped me too is I kept working out and when it could have been tough for me in terms of that I really busted through that tough period because I wasn't going to let it get me. So I don't know what this guy's talking about Razmik I don't know. In that same interview, he magic is asked what some of the myths are that needed to be dispelled about HIV.

In the year 2000, South African President Thabo Mbeki, he convened a an advisory panel on HIV and AIDS. There were 44 members on this panel and it included Peter Duesberg. Duesberg doesn't really believe that AIDS and HIV are real and to the extent they are it's a byproduct of drug use. One of the primary culprits he points to his poppers which is really interesting because a clip was circulating recently of presidential candidate RFK Jr, suggesting that AIDS is caused by poppers. These ideas are insane and dangerous, but they're not really the as far outside the mainstream as we would like to believe. Anyway, Duesberg was the most prominent aids denialist on Becky's panel, and the government would drag their feet on supporting the use of antiretroviral drugs, going so far as to not accept donations and grants towards that end, a study in 2008, published in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency syndromes estimated that at least 330,000 deaths are attributable to that five year delay, which was in part influenced by the panel where Duesberg was the chief denialist.

I mean, you find the truth on the AP and Reuters news wires. But that stuff never gets past the gatekeeper. All the reporters aren't bad. They just wonder why. I wonder why I never go anywhere. You know, the AP reporter that wrote the story about how five black men drug a white man to death in in Jasper, Texas. They said, Oh, we're gonna pay you back. And I called the sheriff and said, I got this AP article from January 14 2002. I'd like to have you on it. I can't come on talk about it. I'd be accused of being racist, like. So see, we all have this unwritten rule. And you're saying, Well, what are you talking about? You know, you go from implantable microchips to white people dragging a white man to death and loosehead came off. But whatever the point is, you all heard about him dragging the poor black man mr. I don't know Mr. King, drug name, dragging the death of his cat head came off. And they were in prison together in gang wars together and it's horrible what happened to him but five black guys drunk, an old white man to death walking down the same superhighway why there's a white guy, let's kill a white. And they do it. The whole media knows just I mean, what a human interest story. Blacks kill a wide on the same stretch of road. Let's not but the AP reporter thought Well, that's an interesting article writes it. I get the AP article. No one ever reports on I called the sheriff gonna come on and talk about we don't talk about a smart chair. He knows the rules.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:57:09.000
    | text      = So one of the things that I find really telling about Alex's recollection about this story is that he has exactly one specific detail. He doesn't remember the name of the black man who was lynched by being dragged behind a truck by white supremacists in 1998. He remembers the name of John King, the white supremacist who is the ringleader of that murder. This is the person who Alex ascribes an identity to he's the person who has personhood, who isn't just a black or a white. That's not insignificant. Alex knows who that guy is. Yeah. Yep, that murder was not due to some kind of a jailhouse fight Alex it just lying based on the detail that King and one of his accomplices joined a white supremacist gang while they were in prison prior to the murder, it was pretty clear why they did what they did based on statements that they made after the fact and based on how they intentionally left his torso in front of a black church. The sheriff at the time was Billy rolls, who retired in 2019. After 50 years on the force, he seems like a pretty frank guy. In 2011, he was reflecting on the media attention that he got after this murder. This guy's name was James Byrd. We've talked about that in the past. And that's why I'm not going into a great detail. And the details of it are fucking horrific. Yeah. But when he was reflecting on the media attention, this Sheriff rolls said, quote, you know, everybody came out here expecting to find a racist community and a redneck sheriff. A pot bellied snuff, dipping beer drinking Sherif that was a bigot. Most of that was all right, but I wasn't a bigot. That's kind of fun. All right. Yeah. Okay. I was mocking himself a little bit. I gotcha. I honestly have no idea what revenge murder Alex is talking about where five black men killed a white guy. And from all the digging I've done, I can find literally no evidence of this happening. i If someone knows what he's talking about, I would be open to hearing what that is. But like I've seen interviews with Sheriff rolls, reflecting on the murder and the aftermath. And I think if there were a revenge, copycat murder, it seems like a relevant part of the aftermath, but nothing like that ever comes up. I suspect that Alex read some headlines about how the town was scared about more violence occurring because the Klan decided that they wanted to do a rally in Jasper. And that brought out folks like Khalil Muhammad and the new Black Panthers. So tensions were really high. I have a feeling that Alex just came up with a story in his head that allowed him to minimize the gravity of this actual lynching because he's heavily invested in not believing that racist white people exist. And if by some unimaginable fluke, one does exist, they're one to one balanced out by a racist black person. Of course, the tragedy is that this lack of evidence that of this other murder happening, it wouldn't hurt the audience's faith and Alex's narrow If the lack of evidence would simply be proof of how good the covered the cover up was that Alex is also alleging is happening here. So, yeah, it's bullshit.
