'''Alexander Nekrassov''' is a former (?) Kremlin presidential adviser, and has been involved with the Russian government for about the last two decades. He has a long history of writing for publications such as Al Jazeera and others about topics like how [[Marine Le Pen]] is great and it's not a problem that Russian state banks donated millions to her campaign, or how [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] is the good guy in Ukraine. He seems to have a pretty consistent messaging with state media outlets. In an interview with Alex, he literally explained that when he worked for the Kremlin, he was a "fixer," and his job would be to work behind the scenes. Alex does not grasp that he is being worked over by a high-level foreign government fixer live on air at any point.
