This page lists the common sound drops and their origins. It also includes some clips that have become often quoted (and sometimes misquoted) in-jokes. It is not intended as a full listing of out-of-context drops, those belong on the individual episode pages.

This listing is currently deeply incomplete. It is sourced from various Reddit and discord discussions, as well as the official clip listing<ref>https://knowledgefight.com/drops</ref>.

Where possible, the episode and timestamp presents the in-context origin and discussion of the clip. If there is no such discussion, it is the time that clip first was played on the podcast (usually as an out of context drop).
