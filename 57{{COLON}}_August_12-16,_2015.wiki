*'''Walter Jones''': US Representative from North Carolina's 3rd congressional district. Jones, no relation to Alex, is a republican, but also is a Ron Paul type of cat. He is on the show today to talk about how he is trying to lead a movement to remove John Boehner as Speaker of the House, and thus pave the way for a patriot, libertarian speaker. Spoiler alert: Boehner was already given some indications that he was going to step down, and he was replaced by Paul Ryan, someone who could not be further from the idea of a "patriot, libertarian speaker."

===Narratives===

Alex is pretty worked up on this episode. He is absolutely predicting that the Chinese economy is about to collapse, and the world's markets will go with it, likely by winter. This prediction would not come to pass.

Alex's need to stoke people's fear is very extreme today, and on multiple occasions, he predicts that the "Globalists" are probably going to nuke someone soon, because they feel their grip on power slipping. He speculates that they are going to nuke a US city to distract from himself or Drudge getting assassinated. Just a few more predictions that did not come to pass.

Beyond that, Alex spends a fair amount of time spouting pro-Assad positions, and building up his narrative that Assad had made a deal with Russia and our military (behind Obama's back) to take out ISIS, at which point Assad would step down and head to retirement in the UK. None of this is based in reality, and really is just another example of Alex Jones mirroring the Russian version of geopolitical positions.

*'''Rev. Clenard Childress''': Childress is a Baptist preacher who also runs a website called BlackGenocide.com. His main area of focus is that abortion is intentionally used as a means of black genocide, which is a bold claim that never really gets defended. Abortion rates in every demographic group has been decreasing for decades, but the trends do show that the deciding factors that make abortion rates higher in some communities are systemic: financial inequality, unequal access to regular health care, the rise of abstinence only education, etc. Alex mostly has Childress on to provide cover for him to say things like "I've seen more racist black people than white people."
*'''Wayne Madsen''': Madsen is an investigative reporter who seems to have a particular interest in hating the Clintons and saying that Mossad is behind pretty much every tragedy in the world, from 9/11, to the murders carried out by Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik. Since 2015, Wayne and Alex have had a falling out, with Wayne tweeting out that Alex is a "bloated lying shitbag." He has also recently taken to tweeting very anti-Trump stuff, and retweeting Alex Jones' ex-wife's tweets about how Alex is a racist.

*'''Harry Dent''': Very dicey economic expert. Harry Dent frequently appears on Alex's show, suspiciously almost always to make claims about how financial collapse is right around the corner. On today's show, he says, "we are probably a week away from a complete collapse." Spoiler alert: this prediction did not come to pass. Dent is using very irresponsible rhetoric on a show that is broadcast by a gold sales company, with a host who is constantly telling his audience that they need to buy gold to be safe when the economy collapses (as Alex does many times on this episode).

===Narratives===

A whole lot of this episode is functionally a long infomercial for people to buy gold. It comes up repeatedly, and Harry Dent's appearance exists almost exclusively to facilitate Alex's sales pitch. This is the content of the show being led by the advertising, specifically for Genesis Communications Network's parent company Midas Resources, a gold and precious metals company. It is disgraceful, and should tell you everything you need to know about Alex's integrity.

Past this, Alex spends a lot of time trying to tie the idea of abortion to black genocide, and gets very weird about the fact that he has admitted on air that he's paid for multiple abortions in the past.

As for the 2016 election, here is Alex's position as of August 13th:

*Alex has an African-American guest, so he says "Ben Carson would be a real black president"
*Alex says that maybe Trump could save the world, but he's been in with the "Globalists" for his whole life, and says that he "smells a big rat."
*Alex still supports Rand Paul for President, but would be fine if Carson won.

Beyond all that, Alex asserts that "Russia hasn't done anything to anyone" as it relates to Ukraine (Alex says it's all George Soros' fault), and Alex claims that NAMBLA is a federally recognized non-profit (it is not, in fact there are strong indications that NAMBLA doesn't even really exist anymore as a centralized organization).

===Narratives===

This episode is pretty all over the place. Alex seems to be in a bit of a manic phase, so he jumps around from topic to topic without a real central thesis, other than Alex's perceived importance in the world.

He goes on a very troubling unhinged rant about how he will never sell out, which is incredibly hilarious considering he is mere months away from turning himself into a full-on propagandist for Donald Trump, and that at the end of this episode, he calls Trump a "casino-owning shark" and a "slumlord."

Alex goes on to read a review of his product Brainforce that accidentally suggests that it may be very bad for you to take. The reviewer says that they didn't really notice much of an effect until they stopped taking Brainforce, at which point they felt a lot worse and assumed they must have been feeling great before because of the Brainforce. This is strongly indicative that the supplement may cause a dependence, or that it is at least dangerous enough to cause a withdrawl.

Alex voices support for the "constitutionalists" and "sovereign citizens," claiming that they aren't doing anything wrong or violent, then has to double back and admit that they kill multiple cops every year.

This show is really inconsequential until the show reaches the Overdrive section, at which point an out-and-out white supremacist calls in. The caller claims that "diversity" just means "white genocide," which is absolutely in line with Alex's world view, but he doesn't want to hear it mirrored back to him from a literal white supremacist.

The caller is a fan of David Duke, and insists that Alex needs to have Duke on for an interview, most likely because on some level, he suspects that Alex would realize that he agrees with Duke on pretty much everything. After about 10 minutes of Alex trying to deflect the caller's insistence that he should talk to Duke, Alex kind of freaks out about how everyone thinks he's Jewish.

Alex does not know how to handle this situation because he cannot agree with the caller, but he knows that he will lose a large portion of his base if he attacks white supremacy or antisemitism directly, so he waffles in the middle. "I'm not antisemitic, but there are so many bad Jews in the New World Order," is the sort of line he tries to take.

It's a very sad display, especially knowing that, within a week, Alex would have David Duke on the show for a very unsettling interview.

===Narratives===

This Sunday episode is a very important moment in Alex Jones' journey toward joining the Trump bandwagon as their most desperate, self-contradictory propagandist.

Up until this point, Alex has been saying that he has high level sources that have told him that Trump is a "front man for consortiums on the East Coast," and that Trump is deeply connected to the mob. Alex has said that it is a very real possibility that Trump is being blackmailed into running for president to destroy the Republican party, and that he is probably a "Globalist"/Hillary shill. He does like that Trump is anti-vaccination and that he wants to shut down immigration, but Alex has been steadfast that his allegiance lies with Rand Paul.

And then, on this show, he starts the show by saying that "he may have been wrong" about Trump. Almost certainly, what this means is that Alex has started communicating with Roger Stone behind the scenes, and Roger has started spinning his web.

Whether you believe that Roger quit the campaign or he was fired, [https://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/sources-roger-stone-quit-wasnt-fired-by-donald-trump-in-campaign-shakeup-121177 he had left his role as Trump's top campaign adviser a week prior]. Stone [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/roger-stone-sam-nunberg-protect-dont-require-protection/story?id=53567858 would later say]:

<blockquote>"I continue to maintain that I resigned. I reached the conclusion that Donald Trump would be his own strategist...I also came to the conclusion that I could be more effective on his behalf outside the campaign.

"</blockquote>

It is our feeling that the way he decided he could be more effective on Trump's behalf outside the campaign is to enlist the support of a man he met two years prior at a JFK convention, Alex Jones.

Alex's tone changes very drastically, and the timing of it all seems very questionable. Where he previously called Trump's behavior "narcissistic," he now describes the same behavior as "masculine," one of the highest compliments Alex can give someone.

He is not fully on board with Trump yet, but it is very clear from this episode that this was when his defenses began to drop. The most fascinating thing, however, is that his audience is still operating on his original talking points, so almost all of the callers parrot back his old lines like "Trump is a Clinton shill," and Alex has a difficult time debating his recent rhetoric with his new perspective.

Also, on this episode, we learn that Super Male Vitality is absolutely about getting erections. Alex claims it's stronger than Viagra.
