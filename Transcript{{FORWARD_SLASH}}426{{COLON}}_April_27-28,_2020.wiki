According to nurse.org There's Some research going on at Cedars Sinai that involves a technology called heal light, which quote delivers intermittent ultraviolet a light through an endo tracheal catheter. It's being studied as a potential treatment for viruses and bacteria. And it's showing some promise, but it's not at the point where it can be used on people like Alex's suggest, quote, here, light is not yet approved by the FDA for use or approved as a COVID-19 treatment. And more studies on its use in humans will be needed before it can be verified as effective. Researchers, they're working on this technology and they're following appropriate guidelines for that kind of thing. And it's worth noting that they've been working on this project since at least 2016. So it's not something that's been developed in response to the Coronavirus it some research that somewhere in the middle of the process and we'll see where it goes from there. Alex wants you to think that they're getting banned from social media because that makes it appear that the globalists are totally losing control. They have to ban this totally legitimate and credible hospital from social media because they're saying something that bucks the narrative, but none of that's real. It's all just bullshit. Yeah. So

    | text      = funny when Alex says they make you read four pages, like that's some kind of undue burden being put on his plate. He's supposed to be this deeply competent researcher. He's supposed to read 1000 books about World War Two, four pages is nothing particularly when there's nuance to the issue that takes couple paragraphs to explain. I can say pretty comfortably that Alex did not read those four pages. The article on USA Today doesn't say that Snopes said that this point isn't true. The only two points Snopes is even mentioned are using Snopes as a citation because they reported that a meme about this issue was quote shared on social media in mid April. Sure. And then later in the article. Snopes comes up again in this line, quote, Snopes investigated the claim finding it's plausible Medicare pays in the range Jenson the guy who was on Fox News talking about this mentioned, but doesn't have a one size fits all payment to hospitals for COVID 19 patients. So nowhere in the article doesn't say that Snopes said this wasn't true. Alex is making that up because he wants to make it look like Snopes was lying in there fact check. This fact check is actually less detailed than others that I've read. But it does cover the important point which is explaining the part of this conspiracy theory that is real. hospitals do get paid more by Medicare for patients who are treated by COVID 94 COVID-19. There's a 20% increase in payments that are dispensed by Medicare, which was established by the Cares Act, which Trump signed into law recently. So Trump did this. The reason for the 20% bump is that hospitals are seeing a massive drop in revenues right now as People who have other issues that might have sent them, you know, might have sent them to go get checked out, they're delaying being seen or they're just toughing it out due to the virus, the increase of 20% is meant to offset the decreases they're seeing in normal operating funds not to lie in anyone's pockets. There's, you know, there's pretty clear in the USA Today article, quote, hospitals and doctors do get paid more for Medicare patients to cover the cost of care and less loss of business resulting from a shift of focus to treating COVID 19 cases, at the end of the day, that's at the end of the article. So Alex would have estimated could make it through four very difficult to get there. No, can't expect them to put that sort of effort, backbreaking labor. Absolutely. So Alex then goes to rebroadcast. Of course,

I don't believe that anyone who's read the Bible or has been involved in any church with any regularity would not know how to pronounce the name of the book, Hosea. It's just unbelievable to me that someone with any real history with the Bible would encounter that word and think it might be Jose.

But in reality, what it demonstrates is a really scary level of isolation we're taking on. Also this news didn't just break the Guardian reported on this story on April 24. Fourth, three days before the episode Alex is doing where he's calling this a breaking juicy piece of news. What happened is the global leaders got together on a video call and quote pledged to accelerate cooperation on a Coronavirus vaccine. But that's not all. It was also about sharing research. And as the Guardian reported, quote, The cooperation pledge made it a virtual meeting was designed to show that wealthy countries will not keep the results of research from developing countries. Because Trump has shown such outright hostility to the who he couldn't take part in this meeting without giving an implied endorsement of them which he's too much of a baby to do. And so the supposed leader of the free world, the head of the world's great superpower, turned his back on an international pledge to make sure the developing world is not left behind because they can't afford to pursue the level of medical research that we can fuck all this and fuck Alex for celebrating it.

When Alex says Anglo American establishment, he's not talking about the West. He cannot be because the foundation of his narratives about the globalists largely rests upon the foundation of misrepresentations of Carol Quigley's writing. Alex pretends that he's read Quigley's book, tragedy and hope and in that book quickly admits that there's a group of people who operate in secret to control the world. These are the roundtable groups who control the Council on Foreign Relations, the Royal Institute of International Affairs and countless other bodies. This group was set up by Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner and quickly very clearly refers to the collection of these groups as the Anglo American establishment. That's literally the name of Quigley's previous book about roads and the influence he's had over the years. I've heard Alex use that term in relation to Quigley many times. It's shorthand for the proto globalists in this fear of the Infowars conspiracy.

Sure, according to the Library of Congress by 1900, the year 1900 30% of the US population had migrated to cities and we're living in areas you could call urban centers. I don't know if Alex expect people to believe that between 19 119 29 approximately two thirds of the urban population relocated back to rural areas, but either way he's just talking shit. According to 2018 data from Pew social trends, a majority of the US population lives in areas that would be qualified as suburban at this point. Yeah, rural population is approximately 14% at that point and urban comes in around 31%. According to Pew, one of the primary drivers of the higher level Have population in urban areas is immigration. Most of the time people who come to this country from another country aren't doing so to settle in rural Montana. Most of the time, they'll gravitate towards locations with the most job opportunities or places with at least some semblance of community that they can connect with, like people who share their country of origin or religious practices. Those things are not as likely to be found in rural areas as compared to urban ones. There are other variables but this is one big driver of urban and suburban population growth. It's not shared by rural areas. Anyway, Alex is just making things up but urban and rural areas as well as about the Great Depression, but good to know that he would eat his neighbor.

So I know we've heard Alex talk a lot in the past about how after 15 days of no food we all become cannibals but I don't think I've ever heard him discuss his willingness or dare I say enthusiasm to eat his neighbor's fantastical enthusiasm. It made me wonder. So I decided to look into cannibalism a little bit. And I've had two interesting bits of research on the subject that I think Alec should consider. Sure. The first came from a 2017 article in Time about research done by James Cole, the Senior Research Lecturer in anthropology at the University of Brighton, cool published a study in Nature that looked at the caloric content of a human body, like all the edible parts. Yeah. And it came to the conclusion that it seems unlikely that most of the historical instances of cannibalism were driven by a need for food, except in cases like the Donner party. Sure, part of the reason for this is that, as Cole put it, quote, the mental and physical effort to hunt a hominid would presumably be much greater given the hominins ability to fight Ron and think their way out of the hunt. what he's getting at is that compared to most any other source of food, the calories you would expend to eat a person would almost not be worth it from a nutritional perspective. It's a bad strategy, unless you literally have no other option. And even then you probably do have a better option you haven't considered like various wild plants.

    | text      = The second article I found was pretty interesting. It was in the sun discussing a recent study published in the Journal of Forensic Science, researchers profiled five cases of people who practice cannibalism and found that they had some interesting commonalities. Essentially, what they found was the people who ended up eating other people are pretty consistently either severely schizophrenic, or they're survivors of intensely dysfunctional childhoods. And in the case of two case studies, quote, feelings of humiliation seemed to be the trigger and both patients assaulted their victims at a time when they suffered a loss of self esteem. Hmm, granted, Alex isn't actually eating anyone right now, but he's talking about being cool with doing so right at a point when he seems to be suffering a bit of a loss of self esteem. I do hear I do think he's being serious. I found that thread to be troubling. From the sun article, quote, in the cases of cannibalism, and patients who suffered from schizophrenia, the researchers found there was a history of emotional friction and hostility in their parent child relationships. The academics concluded the schizophrenic ones performed cannibalism as a very extreme reaction of self defense to a threat of destruction. physical or psychological? Wow. For the ones with a personality disorder, cannibalism boosted their self esteem and relieve tension. Quote, ego and narcissism are the central issue with a desire to overcome deep rooted frustrations by means of an extraordinary act. It kind of sounds like if you take if you just replace, actually eating people and talking about eating people, it's that same thing what Alex is, is looking for. He's looking to overcome deep rooted frustration. He feels this seems like an extreme reaction of self defense to a threat of destruction, physical or psychological. It's, I would assume he has some hostile hostility in his parent child relationship. Oh, you think? You know, so what does all this mean? I don't know. Maybe nothing. Or maybe I totally believe it when Alex says that he'd be fine. One of the two.

So I applaud that. Yes. If that's if that's the only thing you're bringing to the table. Unfortunately, everything else he's talking about is wrong and genuine. Well, yeah, it's not. Yeah, so that 255 million number is not a new development. It's just from the same Guardian article he's been citing on this story the whole time. He's never read it, though. I can tell that the article is published on April 21. And it warns that due to the crisis, we're in now, quote, at least 265 million are being pushed to the brink of starvation. All experts on the topic agree that the two most essential things needed to stop the looming catastrophe is money and access, we can all donate and try to make a difference that way. Or we can pressure our government to take threats seriously, and provide funding to organizations that are on the ground helping people beyond that these people who are the aid workers need access, they need to be able to cross borders to get the assistance to the people who need it. The essential message of this article, which chiefly quotes Beasley the head of the UN World Food Programme, is that quote, we can stop this becoming a world a widespread famine, that we need to act quickly and smartly. That's the bottom line. So we're fucked. This article was published under the Global Development Initiative at The Guardian. And if you actually read the article, there's a little icon that says supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The content is editorially independent, but the only reason a lot of this reporting that Alex is relying on to build his completely nonsensical and exploitative narratives exists. The only reason it exists is because of money donated by the very people. He's trying to paint as the arch villains who are trying to starve the developing world. So again, I say, take this problem seriously. But don't for a second think that Alex gives a single shit about this. These people are props to him, and he'll gladly yell about their deaths to make his political point. But he wouldn't do one inconvenient thing to help them out. So again, very serious issue. And I'm glad that Alex is bringing it up that other people are bringing it up. I guess I'm not glad he's bringing it up, because he's just using it.
