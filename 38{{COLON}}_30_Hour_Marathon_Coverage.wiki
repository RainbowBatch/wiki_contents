Today, Dan tells Jordan about some of the important events that went down in Alex Jones's 30 hour "Marathon Broadcast for Free Speech." Despite containing about 29 hours of garbage, a couple important topics came up:

*Is Alex Jones teasing his inevitable turn on Trump?
*Is Alex Jones the victim of "gay bullying?"
*Did Obama literally steal a bunch of money from housing lenders?
*Does Alex get really defensive when people imply that his voice is fake?

==Tidbits==

*Breakdown of 30 hour marathon
*Alex's dad sponsors his first radio show
*Alex's oxygen levels are low
