{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 11:00
    | text      = Well, and the other thing that that plays into that is there's this like even Alex's, like, put off by Oh, fuck off. You know, there's some of that. Yeah. And I think that there is a little bit of that. But larger picture, there's a context in which he is put off and gives pushback. Yeah. And I think that that dynamic is something that is being missed by a lot of commentating on this. So that's something that I'd like to pay attention to as we as we go through this.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 13:50
    | text      = Yes, he's wearing a full face, cloth mask. It's weird, but honestly, I don't really care if there's some kind of artistic meaning behind it. There really isn't any point in saying he's going mask off because that masks been off for a while now. And I guess he could be aiming for something along the lines of like rejecting his own celebrity and making himself appear to be an anonymous blank slate. But even if that's the point, it's dumb, because if he were just any random person making the statements he has been, no one would pay him any attention. The only reason no one's kicked his ass yet is because he's gay. Ironically, his celebrity status grant him the privilege to say this bullshit and people actually pay attention to it. Yeah. It seems like his main goal here is to say that we need to center things on Jesus. And that's all good and well to a point to say that people should put Jesus first in their homes is kind of an opinion that doesn't work for everyone. But it's not a problem so long as it's not something that's being imposed on people, suggesting that businesses and our country should operate in some religious fashion, however, is antithetical to the United States and our constitution that Alex claims to love. That isn't a problem for Nick and da though. They want to be a part of a Christian fascism that's completely disconnected from the liberalism that values things like freedom of religion, freedom of speech and free association. It's unclear how much Alex is aware of that. But the people he's talking to say things that he likes about God, but they're advocates for a system that would completely destroy all the things about America that he pretends to love. Anyway, this is possibly as innocuous as gay could have started off the interview. And already he's saying something pretty fucked up that Alex should push back on, but doesn't right.

    | text      = Gray said know what? It's in Deuteronomy. There we go. So this stuff that you're saying is not a new idea, necessarily, but it's one that's pretty important to push back on. The first thing that merits pointing out is that it means nothing to say that a person in a porn film is someone's daughter. That's just a way for you to couch a rigidly paternalistic and misogynistic view of the world into a form where you can present it as if it's based on some kind of like a sincere concern or care for another person, instead of what it is a lust for control other over other people's lives. The tale here is that he doesn't say that male actors and pornography are someone's son. That isn't part of this because at its core, it's really just a desire to exert control over women. In 2013, the Journal of Sex Research published a study titled pornography actresses and assessment of the damaged goods hypothesis. This was a name given to a theory that higher rates of drug abuse, childhood abuse and overall psychological problems led to women gravitating towards pornographic work. The study took the histories of 177 women in adult entertainment, and 177 women not in that field, and ultimately concluded that the two groups did not have a difference in terms of childhood abuse. What yeh saying has no connection to reality in the big picture, there are certainly people in pornography who are survivors of childhood abuse. That's the truth of people in journalism, marketing or any other field. Now, if EA cared at all about this issue, the angle he could be taking is to discuss the abuse that happens within the adult industry. But that's a larger issue that I'm not entirely confident I can cover appropriately, perhaps another day, and da doesn't seem to care about that all that much at all. Yeah, the point here is that Yang is coming out of the gate hot with a complaint that feels different than his recent anti semitic outbursts, but it's actually not people like IE Michael Jones, who Nick Fuentes is a follower of had been very public. They believe that pornography is a Jewish weapon against Christian society. So this is actually more on theme than it might appear to be. And Alex isn't picking up on these threads or if he is he's not pulling on them at all. Yeah, he's just presenting this in a way that masks that underlying point. And so that made it just it comes off as if he's like, Oh, you are you? You care?

Because you can you can process the abuse against women in a way that allows you to kind of internalize this? Well, they may be they're kind of where they should be point of view, as opposed to dealing with the fact that all women in all jobs everywhere are subjected to violence, just by virtue of being women, and more than 40% of them will experience it at some point in their life, regardless of what you do. So yeah, well, maybe deal with the big problem. But no, I think we should control their ability to do and say anything.

The dude just sounds like an angry loser who wants anyone else to be responsible for the situation he's in other than himself. The way he is talking sounds intensely abusive, and I can totally understand Kim leaving. He's claiming that he has a problem with porno, and his way of thinking he can deal with it is to exert control over how his wife appears publicly. She won't let him control her. And thus, it's her fault that he can't stop with his porn addiction somehow, yeah, he's so averse to correctly assigning responsibility that he has to insinuate that Kim was like duped into that picture. It was a Paste Magazine, I believe that like the internet article, don't give a shit about a Kardashian. That's absurd. But in order for him to preserve the image of Kim is a good person and not part of the evil system that he's up against. She has to have her agency stripped away from her. And Yang has to not have been aware of that photo shoot. It's just childish shit all around. And these are the kinds of issues that could really be helped with therapy.

    | text      = Well, I mean, I would just start with this. There are good people from every group and every type of culture. And we all know that. But definitely the left. When it was American defeated, Hitler calls their opposition Hitler when both my grandfather's almost died in the Army Air Corps. Both of them almost died, one of them crashed, landed, after a mission and got all broke up. The other one got hit the German air raid in North Africa. And he'd only done like 18 was missions. And then he'd had a concussion and he was the captain. And then his buddies went the next day and blew up over Italy. He was always freaked out but never really talked about really died. But we die. We read the letters and all the awards, he had seven the things he did after that, and then you know, reopening and recommitting to the Army Air Corps. So I take it as an offense to have George Soros and people that actually worked for Hitler. rounding up people tell me I'm a Nazi, when I almost don't exist, but my grandfather's one over there. So So I got a lot to say about this. Oh, so close this nuanced with the whole thing that's going on, but expanding on that, give us because I want you to go wherever you want. So just let's just have you talk for 1015 minutes more before me and why we got a lot here from point why we heard but we want to hear from you. Go ahead.

    | text      = So this is really sad, because I think that Alex thinks that this is going to be effective in cutting off the anti semitic stuff before it even comes up. He really thinks that saying that he almost doesn't exist because of the Nazis and throwing out this bland as sorrows lie is going to set the table where you can be presented as somebody who's saying controversial things, but he's being unfairly smeared by the ADL and sorrows. He clearly hasn't been paying close enough attention to what's going on if he thinks that because yeah, he doesn't give a shit about any of that. And it's not gonna stop him from saying the shady he's gonna say, yeah, if anything, saying that Soros worked for Hitler may be a complement and yeas eyes at this point globally. Alex, like Tim Poole, before him, wants to have his cake and eat it too. He's so used to dealing with a completely different sort of figure because he mostly just swims in the waters of right wing scam artists who are trying to use his platform to grow their own scam, right. He almost exclusively works with con artists who have extreme right wing politics they want to advance but are also really worried about doing things that will hurt their ability to run their scams. He's used to people who will equivocate or will accept his framing of their own fucked up comments. what Alex is doing here is giving a a template for how to proceed. He's trying to usher him into territory of anti semitic dialogue that won't get you in trouble because Alex knows that. Yeah, he's spouting straight up anti semitism, but that isn't something Alex can profit off of without altering his position in the market. Becoming more like EA would involve scaring off older more Normie members of his audience and without them the pill sales crater and he can't pay overhead on the expensive as studio. Yeah, but if Yagan moderators position they can make some money together and EA can still be super anti semitic. Alex is trying to present him with a way to bake in plausible deniability, seemingly unaware that yay isn't denying any of the shit. Except the Holocaust. Yeah, we'll get to that a little later.

I know for a fact that Alex was fully aware of Nick's white nationalism and neo Nazi beliefs as early as CPAC 2020. And he didn't care. He had Nick on repeatedly gave him his own channel on bandit video and went on tour with him on the stop the steel crusade. And all of that was possible because Nick played along with Alex's moderation language. But the thing is that Nick was playing along strategically, he was following the exact plan that we heard him lay out on our last episode where he wasn't showing his true ideology publicly, because he needed to be a more acceptable face to closer the the mainstream folks could accept, right, and then he could drop all the red pills he wanted when the time was right. Alex willingly or not probably willingly fell for that. And this is the end result of that. Yeah. These are the fruits of letting a hyper competent, charismatic Nazi. hijack your platform.

Just because it blew his mind that two Jewish people worked in two separate administrations, that doesn't mean it's actually mind blowing, he might just be an idiot.

But I still don't want him to be used as a punching bag by Nazis in order to make their dumb points look less dumb. Saying that there's such a thing as the black vote is not analogous to saying the Jews run banking. That is a false equivalence, it would be a valid point, if you were allowed to talk about the black vote but not allowed to talk about the Jewish vote. That would be where the difference would be something that you could point out, but that isn't what Nikkor gay points out because people talk about the Jewish vote freely. This is the not very subtle sleight of hand that Nick is engaging in and he's doing that trick because this point doesn't work without it.

Plus, this is a complete non sequitur since there aren't talking about the religion of Judaism. They're talking about Jewish people what's going on here? The Talmud is a gigantic document, which is a running discussion among rabbis, between the third and eighth centuries, you can find a whole lot of commentary on the Torah and laws in there a lot of it very affected by the times, when particular texts were written. Yeah, it's important to understand that a lot of what's in the text is a document of a time and that even within the Talmud, there's an evolution of thought, since the point of its writing and since the point of all these things were written Jewish thought has gone through further developments in the same way any religion does. For instance, there's a whole lot of shit in the Bible, that would get you the death penalty. You know, very few Christians would even consider that kind of thing, a problem deserving of stoning. So weird. Yeah. All this stuff is also Nick using historically anti semitic misinterpretations of the text in order to make accusations. For instance, the pedophilia accusation often traces back to this passage in the Talmud. Quote, if an adult has sex with a girl under the age of three, it is ignored for it is like putting a finger in someone's eye. I II tears may drip from the eye, but there will always be more tears to replace them. So to the hymen of a girl so young may break but will heal. This is a horrific sounding passage, because, you know, taken out of context, it appears that when it says it is ignored, that means it's open Hey for an adult to have sex with a child, but that's a fraudulent reading of the passage. It's part of a section involving the particular details about a reverse dowry, the amount of man is required to pay a woman in divorce. At the time, virginity made a person's reverse dowry, be higher, so understood as it's actually written. The passage isn't about excusing pedophilia, it's making a hyper specific point about boundaries. This has been used to accuse Jews of being pro child molestation by virulent anti Semites for a long time. And Nick is continuing that tradition on Alex's show, and he isn't he isn't even met with a tiny bit of pushback. Alex isn't equipped to have this conversation at all. And he's now in the position of allowing these to to hijack his show, or be forced to kick them off, and he's not going to do that. So long day for Alex is what I'm saying.

He brings up the fake information about Jews dying from the vaccine in Israel to be a counterpoint to yeas assertion that Jews run everything. How could they run everything if their own people are dying in mass from the vaccine in Israel? It makes no sense. Yeah, a response. It's the Zionists they work for Satan. And Alex says exactly. This makes absolutely no sense if you're trying to follow coherent thoughts. Zionism is based around the argument that the Jewish people needed their own homeland originally in terms of the establishment of Israel and eventually towards a movement to develop and build up Israel. Apparently, according to gay the Zionists work for Satan and they're killing Jewish people in Israel, which runs counter to, you know, the essential idea and facilitating point of Zionism cheer. Alex says exactly because he thinks he can work with that since it fits into his anti semitic narratives about how the Jewish people have to create their own oppression so they can assert their political agenda. Think about how he said that the ADL calls everyone who loves freedom Nazis so they can marginalize their political enemies. Alex thinks that this is somehow elevated from yeas anti semitic rhetoric, but in reality, he's as deep in the mud as everyone else on the show. He's just insisting his clothes are clean.

Apparently, according to Nick, she gave some advice about how to handle Trump which EA meant to text if wentest but accidentally texted, texted to Nick Gravano. A to Gervonta he then texted Trump to let them know that it was a setup apparently because giorno is out for revenge or something. Sure. Problem is that Gervonta has been very clear that he didn't tell Trump shit and Nick has no evidence that this happened at all. That's an issue, but that doesn't mean that the dinner wasn't a setup. giorno said she went on record and it said quote, Milo said that he arranged the dinner just to make Trump's life miserable. He was hoping that news of the dinner would leak and Trump would miss handle it. Nick Fuentes echoed that sentiment and he said I hate to say it but the chickens are coming home to roost. Also, Milo himself told NBC quote, I wanted to show trump the kind of talent he's missing out on by allowing his terrible handlers to dictate who he can and can't hang out with. Sure. I also wanted to send a message to Trump that he has systematically repeatedly neglected, ignored abuse, the people who love him the most the people who put him in office and that kind of behavior comes back to bite you in the end. lesson here is don't ever associated with any of these people. It will end up turning bad at some point. They don't have any shame.

This is bullshit. And Alex is not pushing back in this interview at all. He's fully engaged. It's just kind of hard to see that at times, because his role isn't necessarily to say the same things as the A and Nick is to give an ineffectual push back and try to sanitize the things they're saying. Yeah, so people don't see them for what they actually are. Yeah, there have definitely been tensions between Jewish groups and Christian groups historically, but the stuff in the Talmud that Nick is talking about is an old anti semitic smear. And the Talmud, there are references to a magician named Balaam, who's remembered for trying to curse Jewish people. These references are understandably not positive. There were theories that points in history that the mentions of Balaam were coded references to Jesus, but these theories have been debunked yet, they are still perpetuated and asserted by anti Semites like Nick in order to incite hatred toward the Jews and Christians. Sure. Here's a passage about Jesus from the Talmud, quote, the intent of the creator of the world is not within the power of man to comprehend for His ways are not our ways, nor are his thoughts, our thoughts. Ultimately, all the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth, Nazareth will only serve to prepare the way for messy acts coming and the improvement of the entire world motivating the nations to serve God together. Nick is referencing passages that were about Balaam like this one, quote, the disciples of Balaam the wicked inherit ghanim and descend into the nethermost pit Gahan gnome is a somewhat synonymous or analogous to hell, in Talmud. He is passing along an old anti semitic smear and Alex has literally no ability or interest to engage with what he's doing, essentially allowing the slander to be legitimized in the eyes of the audience. They should read it for themselves, because Jesus was trying to take over the whole thing.

His discussion of working for Satan involved threesomes, which seems really tame for the devil. Yeah, if I had to guess I would assume that he has a bit of a problem when it comes to impulse control, and that expresses itself through sex and pornography. Instead of dealing with that going to therapy, he's decided to internalize the neo Nazi argument that pornography is a weapon that Jews use to destroy society. And in order to turn this into some kind of a high minded idea. He's presenting it as a concern for people engaged in sex work. It's all really stupid, but it kind of feels in line with the trend of the things he's saying.

You can look at this broadcast and say, Nicholas Winchester is a 2324 year old you know, secret dog whistling kk k Nazi, but that's also not the case. You could say that Alex Jones and Owen Shroyer are actually platforming hate, but that's not what's going on at all. And I think we're all just sucking on Kanye data right now narrative history is that realizing that the Overton window the Republican establishment so that the window conservative movement so this out the churches, they closed, so when we look for leadership on the right, there was none. Okay? When Owen Shroyer got charged when Ali Alexander got sued, investigated, Alex, when you got sued, do we get a call from our Lago saying, Hey, I'm a billionaire. And I want to I want to help fund what you guys have been through. For me, Trump can't afford it either. So here we are left with the last option on Infowars, the home of the resistance, and we're a bunch of pseudo celebrities with one celebrity saying, Okay, well, we're just gonna break bunch of losers. We're getting off your chess board because it is rigged. It's rigged by Lucifer. It's rigged by the satanists. It is rigged by the Jewish mafia. And people don't want to say that it's rigged by the Marxist and the leftists, and all of these people. And it's actually frankly, rigged by people who would, you know, betray Christ within the church, the apostates. So I think that this broadcast should encourage everybody to take everyone else just at their word, only use what they're saying, taken in good faith and in the best light and stop relying on the ADL and the SPLC or Twitter trends. In fact, Elon should get rid of Twitter trends.

It's about six minutes. have extraneous conversation about liberty for the Chinese people. But then there's this and I think it might have been why it was cut out.

It's boring as hell I don't care and then he interviews Jesse Lee Peterson and I think that maybe they cut that out because it looks really weak and you don't want that in the the final product. And the next morning Alex declare bankruptcy. Yeah, so maybe that is more real than it usually appears when sales pitches Yeah, like no, they straight up got hit like with serious expenses because of the increased bandwidth cost. And if there is some silver lining to this possibly, it may be that indirectly or directly, platforming Yeah, is bullshit. anti semitism and Holocaust denial could have bankrupted Alex, it could have led to his bankruptcy.

But the words almost fail. You know, when when trying to look at what what has happened? Yeah, there's a lot of missing the forest for the trees in terms of just boiling this down to yay loves Hitler, or yay, likes Nazis. Yeah. Because, I mean, that certainly is a piece of it. But there's so much more going on. They all funnels into that. Yeah, you know, it's not like there are a ton of different things that are happening. There are a bunch of different things that are all rooted back to this anti semitic ideology, and the clear influences of the people like Milo, Nick, Owen, Benjamin Ali, that are around him, you know, these these, the obsession with pornography and the evils of it very clearly is just a side road of his anti semitic ideas. Yeah, this is it's troubling. I mean, I was in the shower earlier, and I was thinking,

Yeah. And I don't know if I can confidently say that, because he said, there have been a lot of really bad episodes. The Anders Brevik. One sticks out to me. And I don't know how much of that was just because it was, you know, traumatic for me to cover that episode. And, you know, the research into it was really horrible. Yeah. But in terms of like, a presentation of something, you know, he's had Richard Spencer on, he's had David Duke on, those weren't really as bad as this in terms of the incompetence of the pushback. Intentional or otherwise ineffectual. Ness. Yeah. The danger of it in terms of what like what it could be. I feel like it's worse than David Duke. In as much as like David Duke is not cool. Kids don't like to do share. You know, there is a unwise ness of debating David Duke when you're definitely not ready to and you don't really disagree with that. I was gonna say, yeah, that seems dumb, and maybe not the best idea. Yay, is cool, still to a lot of people. And also, he has something that David Duke doesn't have, which is people like Nick Fuentes and Owen, Benjamin and Milo. And I think that presents a unique set of circumstances that are worse. I don't know. I mean, again, I need to sleep on it. Yeah. and reflect. But this is up there as one of the worst episodes of his show that I've heard. Ah, I mean, it's very rare that you actually get someone denying the Holocaust on him for Yeah, yeah, that is something that is it puts it in the category. All right. So

Because we can argue what the worst is, or the definition of the worst, you know, that may not ever come to answer, I can happen all day. My problem with this is that the one way that almost everybody is going to engage with this is the most damaging way to engage with it. To me, the only possible way you can engage with this exactly is if you watch the entire video, or if you listen to our show, because this is a totality. Yeah. And any any, any attempt to shrink it down is damaging. Well, yeah, it's more harmful than his interview climate. I mean, it clips

And right and all that getting lost in that and thinking, Oh, this is such an absurdity. Who would ever take this seriously, is working towards the interest of what the the propaganda is meant?
