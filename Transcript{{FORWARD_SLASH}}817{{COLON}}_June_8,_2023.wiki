And then I saw him put out a video we'll play coming up next segment. Very short. We said listen, and all you're asking questions, I want to just say I appreciate you asking those questions. Thanks for asking the questions. He's talking about the shots civically. So we get McCall on last break. And I talked to him briefly. He's coming on next segment. And I said what's the photos? We see you with Jamie Foxx? Is this accurate? Are you in contact with him? He said yes. So he's coming on with the big scoop next segment. Probably should have said that. The start of the segment. Here's a photo of Dr. Peter McCullough with Fox before he took the shot. But Fox was aware of the shot he didn't want to take the shot. He talked to McCollum about it last year, that was getting pissed they were pressuring him to and now it's come out that indeed he did take multiple shots, Ken knows the shot did it. And that is reportedly going to be coming out very very soon.

I guess we just got a heightened battles a little bit different. But okay. There's also a short little video that Alex plays later. But it also doesn't say any of this. What's going on with Jamie Foxx right now is really disgusting. He had a medical situation that he and his family have requested privacy regarding most of the people in his life. And a fair amount of the media is respecting that and as much as they're covering that he was in the hospital but waiting until he's ready to talk about it to get into specifics or pry about it. But these other fraud as communities are latching on to his medical situation and using it to promote themselves. Initially, the cue leaning folks were saying that this was an attempted assassination because Fox was about to reveal all the secrets of the Hollywood elite parties thrown by people like Diddy. Then the anti vaxxers came around for their slice of the action and the narrative is that Fox reluctantly got vaccinated, and it's now almost killed him. Yeah, Peter McCullough has zero credibility. And there's one picture that everyone posts of him with Jamie Foxx but who knows when that's from or what the context of that picture is? floating out there somewhere in the universe. Yeah. Is a picture of me with two Live Crew.

    | text      = Yeah, and he hasn't read these articles about food stuff. The Guardian article isn't about how big factory farms with robot bugs are better for the earth than local organic produce. It's an editorial about how there's a growing consensus that eating locally grown stuff isn't always the best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The prevailing wisdom previously had been that locally sourced stuff was better because it had to travel a shorter distance unless it cut out emissions during the transportation phase. However, more research has shown that the transportation of these goods contributes significantly less to the emissions calculation than the factor of how the per produce itself has grown, locally grown stuff in Eco conscious Farms is obviously going to be the ideal since you limit the emissions in production and transportation. However, if you have to choose one variable, it might be best to focus on the production instead of the transport. Better produced goods from far away may be better for the earth than poorly produced local ones. And that that's against a lot of the the ethos of the farm to table movements that had gone on. Yeah, that really emphasize the cutting out the transportation is paramount. Yeah. And so that's why this is an interesting conversation. The article is clear that there are benefits to supporting local farms, but that it's easy to fall for the trap of thinking that just because something's local, it's automatically better ecologically than it is nothing about robot bugs. Or, you know, factory chip being better. Yeah, yeah.

The reality is that you're never going to be able to fully reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production since it comes from the methane that animals produce and their manure.

So it's, it's kind of a one step forward, one step back, right. That's it. But you know, the alternative is really, people should transition to a more plant based diet. Yeah, probably. And that would that would help with that factor. But if you're going to eat meat, there's not much knowledge there that you can really, it's gonna be tough. So we get to the Jamie Foxx clip. Sure.

After Alex was on some of Tim's other guests have been Carrie Lake. Lauren Southern and Mark Pellegrino, the guy who played Jacob on last and then went hardcore libertarian. Yeah, what are you gonna do? Fun fact Pellegrino also played the villain Jacob seed in Far Cry five, because this dude loves playing cult figures named Jacob.

I don't like Trump at certain levels. He the the people elected him, so I'm gonna respect that. And I do like Trump a lot of levels. I just don't want to be chump the same time and he's still running around saying the vaccines good. You know, he came out said, Oh, we're gonna investigate the cause autism. Well, I mean, okay, you put a BandAid on a gunshot wound you just gave us. So that's a big deal. But getting rid of Roe v. Wade, securing the border scanning up the China shipping jobs back made his energy independent. I mean, you're pulling us out of the UN who I mean he did Abraham Accords, so many peace deals, peace deals in North Korea are so many good things. But you could have the greatest dinner set there. And then, you know, and then the waiter climbs up on the table and takes a dump everywhere. It kind of still ruins the meal time trying to like ignore all the crap the Trump spill on the table and kind of bite around it. But it really does have a bad smell. I know.

    | text      = who? So? Yeah, don't don't eat that. Don't just go without a meal. Don't skip, skip dinner. That's fine. So that was a whole collection of nonsense that's just meant to allow Alex to play the fence and he wants to try and retain his pro Trump audience while giving some appearance of pushback to retain the folks who have soured on him entirely right. This is really dumb. Based on Alex's callers lately, they don't seem to like Trump at all, and the vaccine shit is insurmountable for them. So Alex's best shot right now is to cut bait. He seems to have forgotten that he doesn't need to support a candidate and lesser of two evils arguments are embarrassing for someone with his belief set to make. He can mock the idea of people voting blue no matter who but if Aleksis insists on caring about electoral politics, he's gonna vote red every time because the other guy works for the literal devil. Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous. Yeah. The only thing I find interesting here is that Alex saying at the beginning, I'm not a pragmatist. I'm a realist. This is really confusing as a way to describe oneself. And I have to say that neither of these terms come anywhere close to fitting what Alex is. But it gets even weirder when he says that he's idealistic. But if the alternative is Biden or Newsom than Trump looks pretty great. That's actually far closer to being a pragmatic perspective than a realist one. Alex isn't speaking about these terms in any academic sense. So what this boils down to is that realism dictates that the world is what it is, and you should use that to guide your beliefs. Realism has no place for idealism. Because idealism is about wanting to change reality. idealism and realism work against each other. Conversely, one can be idealistic and pragmatic at the same time, you can hold lofty ideals, but also recognize that in order to make changes in the world as it exists, you need to deal with the world as it really is, and not as you want it to be. If anything, what Alex should be saying is that he's a rigid ideologue who's willing to play lesser of two evils games, when there's a pragmatic reason to like, for instance, it's really profitable to do that. What follows is Alex listing off a cavalcade of his ideological beliefs, which are not in any way based on realism. Trump is actually the president because the people elected him and Alex is going to respect the will of the people. The COVID vaccine is killing people, the vaccines cause autism, all of that is reflective of Alex's idealism, which is projected onto Trump. And the only reason he has any need to play any of the games that he's playing now is because Trump is not and never was the fulfillment of Alex's ideological fantasies. But Alex said that he was because he wanted to sell him to his audience based on their idealism. And now he's in a little bit of a bind, which is why he needs to retreat to this embarrassing land of lesser of two evils. He didn't have to do that in past elections, because his idealism guided him until he pragmatically realize that there's a shitload of money to be made in doing things this way. And also, just to be clear, you can't really have a pragmatic view of the world and also believe that your enemy has worked for the devil. Yeah, it just doesn't work. Yeah, there's no way there's no way to be pragmatic about that. Demons.

There's like 50 officers that have come out. The story happens like every year. So it's always the same, like were animals like the same program the same why the same thing. And meanwhile, this gets even weirder. Looks on I'm in Texas, our grandfather's World War Two that has worked for oil companies show the big oil fields and we're in New Mexico, in Roswell and my grandfather from like, 46 to like 52 My uncle was born out in New Mexico. They they worked and live in Roswell, the big building this big square buildings and petroleum building. So we were coming back from a Christmas trip like my grandmother's dead now at 92. But she was probably like, a year or something was like 1516 years ago, because my third child was even born then. And we it's we go out to readouts or whatever it is a mountain thing to ski out there. And so we come back in like two days after Christmas and we stop at a Denny's and Roswell Oh, yeah, Bill. My grandfather in the dead of yours is a terrible director in the petroleum building. And we lived a little house, right down the street here and I'm in this Danny's. Nobody's in there. And I'm like, really? I forgot you guys lived in Roswell? Well, what happened in 47, or 48, or whatever here, it was just oh, we were here. I saw the big truck in the in the tarp and the army men with their guns. And, you know, they said it was all secret. Well, if you look at a map where that thing crashes, all these highways and roads, why would they bring it through Main Street in the middle of the day with the press? Right? It was all a psyop. It was all so my grandmother was there. They're like, there's a flying saucer. The aliens are here, here. Let's all go out here in Roswell on the main road. And then let's sit here and see it.
