Just when they thought they were moving away from Project Camelot World, Dan and Jordan get sucked back in. Dan needed a break from Alex Jones, so the gents discuss some paranormal weirdos. In this installment, they look into the time Kevin Moore (the guy who is making a takedown documentary about Project Camelot and Mark Richards) interviewed a guy who claims to talk to time travelers, which is as close as this show gets to a Halloween episode.
