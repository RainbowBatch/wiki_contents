Today, Dan tells Jordan all about why Alex Jones most likely did not really infiltrate Bohemian Grove, or at least did not do so in the way he presented in his documentary Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove. There are a lot of problems, and Dan discusses a few of them, and the gents speculate that a man who lies for a living probably started that career with a big lie.
