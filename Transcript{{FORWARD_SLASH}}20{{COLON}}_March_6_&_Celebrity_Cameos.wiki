All the sudden, that level of pivot, guys, we'd like to start things off, we'd like to, you know, get warmed up. So I have a couple of out of context clips of Alex Jones from the area of time we're covering is all of last week, March 6 through 10th. Right? But I reserve the right to go back to that time period more specifically later. Okay, because the only reason it's basically Monday through Wednesday is what we're covering, but we have to go to Friday in order. Fuck this.

And I've actually pulled up the speech that that's from, and it's actually really great. It's actually a beautiful sentiment that the Pope was making that Alex is twisting. Here's a quote from the Pope, the other pope, Pope, the Pope, he was talking about points he wants to make. The other is a reflection that I shared it on most recent World Meeting of popular movements, I feel it is important to say again, no people is criminal, and no religion is terrorist. Christian terrorism does not exist. Jewish terrorism does not exist. And Muslim terrorism does not exist. They do not exist. No people is criminal or drug trafficking or violent. He's essentially saying that the identification is right.

That's a beautiful thought. That is a beautiful thought. And fuck you Alex for twisting that into claiming that there isn't. There aren't people who are Muslims who do terrorism. That's not the point he's making, right? You're a fucking asshole, Alex. Anyway, here's the last clip. This is Eddie Bravo. I should tell you this.
