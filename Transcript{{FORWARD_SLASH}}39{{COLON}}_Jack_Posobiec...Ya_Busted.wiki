So I've been going back to the well, and we have a couple of time travel episodes, we're going to end up doing okay, in the near future, but I wanted to do one of my own. And so I went back to the day of the Boston bombing. Because I was really curious, because I remember listening to him a little bit back then. Did he say it was a false flag? Oh, big time. Okay. But here's the thing. I don't know if we'll ever cover the episode itself, because, much like the 911 episode, it's really not that interesting. Okay. But as the news of the Boston bombing is breaking, he's in the middle of an interview with Richard Belzer. Richard Belzer. Yeah. So Richard Belzer side cars, his coverage of the Boston bombing over Skype. It's amazing.

    | text      = Belzer it is. So I was digging around was trying to find something for us to cover because like I said, the last few days have been just no man's land. That was no good. I was really struggling and then a real I realized on Monday, Alex Jones did an interview with Jack Passaic. Yes, we've brought him up a couple times in the past. And today, it is finally time for us to delve in to something that I am going to call one of our dirty dossiers. Because as we do this show, it's going to become more and more essential that we clearly delineate who these fucking characters are, okay, that exist in the periphery. Okay. Alex Jones had an interview with Jack for Sobiech because he is one of the main forces behind the Macron leaks. So I found a a New Yorker article that contradicts his story about what happened with the macaron leaks. Okay, this is a New Yorker story that actually uses an interview with Jack for Sobiech as it sort of foundation. Quote from this New Yorker article, I reached the Sobiech by phone on Saturday, the previous day he told me he had flown from Washington to Miami to attend a party hosted by the far right self promoter Milo Yiannopoulos. For sobic spent much of Friday night monitoring 4chan slash poll before chan message boards, which has recently become a breeding ground for nationalist trolls, both in the US and abroad. This is a quote from the Soviet people were claiming something big was coming. So I just kept hitting refresh. He told me shortly before 3pm 3pm and anonymous 4chan user posted nine gigabytes of information, purportedly hacked emails, photographs, and internal documents from the campaign of Emmanuel Macron. For Sobia could not know whether all the information was authentic. He didn't even have time to glance through most of the 1000s of pages. But he considered it his journalistic duty to let his followers know about the leak, quote, massive doc dump at pol he tweeted, he included a link to the 4chan post along with the hashtag Macron leaks. So that's how he got involved. According to him, I'd heard that that

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:07:51.000
    | text      = Yeah, they really got with it. And really, it was hacked by somebody. So anyway, he goes to this party, and people start retweeting it, and it starts to catch steam. And so like, at about midnight, he realizes he's at Milo Yiannopoulos his party, and he realizes that a bunch of other people have started to pick up on this. Obviously, some of these bot farms started to push the content, of course, much like it's been demonstrated has been done in the past. Yes. And so on the phone Sobiech started a live video on Periscope which he called a quote, press conference on macaron leaks. The first few minutes consisted of pisode B, which he has not read or looked at. He's gone to a party at this point. Yes. The first few minutes consisted of for sobic and his girlfriend dancing too bad and bougie by Migos while sob occasionally made the okay hand gesture. All right,

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:09:01.000
    | text      = then he took a little bit of criticism about like the alt right, does it? He took some harsh criticism and his response was, I just find interesting things and post them to my Twitter feed. Look, journalists have gotten so bad that they see someone like me doing real work actually digging through documents and distributing them to people. They assume there must be some sort of conspiracy behind it. I hope that if anything, this can be a learning experience for the New York Times and Lamont and the rest of them to understand how real journalism was he was dancing amigo by his own admission in this article, he didn't read any of the documents. No, he just said like, maybe this is something fucking put it out on Twitter. That was it. Yeah. So that should give you some sort of a sense of what a blowhard fuck this guy is.

Infowars puts out a video about it. Drudge Report puts up a link. Alex Jones starts reporting that Drudge Report is reporting this thing. It's this cycle.

    | text      = Even the fucking newscaster in Arrested Development knows that. Every part of the story can't be part of the story. Yeah, exactly. Even fucking. Anyway, we're gonna talk quite a bit about Jack Sobiech today. And at the end of this, I guarantee you, he won't be busted. But we have to start with why he was on the show on Monday. Okay, so he was tweeting about the Macron leaks. Right. And now he's coming on to Infowars on Monday, because the narrative is that Macron himself is suing jack for Sobiech. So I will let him isn't he suing? LePen I will let Alex Jones start the narrative. All right.

Yeah, all this stuff the like, oh, everyone was creepy there. Yeah, they weren't we I saw the periscope. We heard them. They were just even a little they were just service industry people. Yep. They didn't know what Foosball was. The girl started three days ago. Right most I don't care that she didn't know what Foosball is. Right. That's very believable. Yeah, that's not that's nothing at all. They treated you weird. They gave You're weird. You're weird and that you deserve exactly the weird treatment you got. They give you very polite pizza recommendation. Yes. Your lie is about kids scampering around behind curtains is not true. It's not in the periscope. So when we come to at the end is the only thing that is maybe defensible. And you can't tell from the Periscope because it's shot terribly. And it's dark. But there's a possibility that there's weird art in there.

His own source material doesn't backup his reporting. Nope. So he's a shitty journalist. He's a propagandist. But we need to be afraid of him. And he will be a character that comes up again in the future, I'm sure because he doesn't even because well, because like I said, he's going to come up again.
