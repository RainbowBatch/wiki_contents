He's being done by Fox because Tucker has a non disparagement clause in his contract. He's not been disparaging Fox News. Oh, no. Yeah. So they're leaking it disgustingly to Media Matters, hoping that by messing with Tucker, and getting in his face, that that he will then strike back at them, and then they can play some type of game with his contract.

Patrick and Davidson a really nice guy I like him a lot. You know Newsmax has some good people over there another offering Tucker 100 million dollar contracts the rest of it over the next five years. So just say this. I wouldn't hold your breath. Because Tucker's already been through the experience of having bosses at the Heritage Foundation, and then at CNN and a bunch of other places. And Tucker wants to be his own boss. And in the future in the very near future. I would expect Tucker Carlson to launch his own operation on Stormfront round that build an entire new network.

And I don't think there's any greater truth than the fact that God created the world and Jesus Christ as as you know, the one and only Son, He sent His Son for all of us, and there's no way to be redeemed outside of that. And I understand that there are a lot of atheists who watch a lot of libertarians who now are becoming sympathetic toward the idea because they see that if there are no Judeo Christian principles, right, Western civilization ceases to be this idea of if I don't, if I don't need a God, if you need a God to tell you how to kill, then you must be a horrible person I and I always go with those people say, well, it's like, okay, not all societies agree that you shouldn't kill or certainly the circumstances surrounding killing what, let's go further theft.

Here's where Stephen makes a huge error in his thinking. If these cultures had no concept of personal property, then there is no theft. It's not that they were okay with theft. It's that what Stephen wants to call theft is not theft. His belief in personal property in and of itself creates the existence of theft, which he's decided is wrong and he may be justifies that with the Bible. Steven is getting this backwards by looking down on this culture for being okay with theft when what they're really doing is looking at ownership through a different lens than him and he doesn't care to understand that or present it with any meaningful accuracy.

We text a lot. And I said, I'm gonna step out on a port call me and I stepped out into the hallway. And somebody tried to shake my hand I said, Hey, I hear you can't talk. A little bit distracting. I go, Hey, what's going on Tucker edge Tucker Carlson's voice and start saying these horrible, lewd sexual things to me. And I instantly figure out this is AI. So Almost moving his number, and I confront the individuals on this, they say a few more things, and then the phone hangs up. And I immediately call Tucker and talk to him talk to his lead producer as well, called scooter up. And he said, Hey, If this has happened to me, it's probably happening to other people. This is the next level of their setup. Then it turns out, the individual that did it that has quite a following on Twitter, bragged that they had just done it, and just recorded it and done it. And so we're gonna be talking about that. Look at that he says he's going to be airing it is His name is Frank Stallone, on Twitter. He's gonna be on his show Monday. But very important for Frank Stallone to come on the show today or tomorrow. And explain he's not part of a government group or an agency. Because what he did spoofing someone's number, and then doing that in many jurisdictions is a crime. I don't think Tucker Carlson wants to press charges. But he need to come on the air. And he do explain your intent was not to be mean. But he says he's pointing out the dangers of AI here, finding data, what, but it's serious. You don't know what's going on to what's been happening to Tucker behind the scenes. And so you need to, you need to understand what you did is not good.

I think that there is a very real line between calling a radio show and fucking with them, and calling someone's private cell phone number. I believe that that borders on harassment. I think that spoofing someone else's phone number and using AI to try and trick them into thinking that they're talking to somebody else. Yeah, is a pretty fucked up layer of I mean, it all kind of does go back to harassment. Yeah, it is, it is a bit harassing. And I do not feel pity or empathy for Alex, in this circumstance. I understand that he's a piece of shit, I get it. But this is an invasion of privacy and harassment in a way that I think is not appropriate. Yeah. I don't believe that it's justifiable, because Alex is a piece of shit. Because guess what, there's a bunch of other people with ill intent. Who would think that you or I are pieces of shit? Yep. Because we cover Alex Jones, if we arbitrarily decide who doesn't get their privacy respected, or who is fine to harass in private spaces, because we don't like them, or we have problems with what they do. Yeah, it opens up. Basically, anyone is harassing people. And I mean, what Alex did with the Sandy Hook folks is probably okay. Because, according to him, they were assholes at that time. Yeah.

And if that's the case, I'm gonna prank calls him on his show, you're gonna do whatever, you know, generally, you can tell when something's a prank call. And, you know, I can cover it or not. Yeah, you know what, I still don't think that I would want people to do it. Because I don't want Alex to be able to write us off as some people who are harassing him or whatever it is. I do think that that would D legitimize a lot of the criticisms that we have of them. But you know, people are going to call his show. That's just kind of part of doing radio, you expect that some people are going to be fucking with you, or whatever. I don't think that calling someone's phone number at home is necessarily great. I mean, I've had Alex's phone number for a long time. Yeah, I've had his home address. I like I know these things. And I don't know I I guess it may come down to a difference of opinion.
