Today, we're going to be covering the timespan of July 14 through July 21 2015. It's going to be strange. It's a weird road ahead. But there's a lot of stuff that's very worth discussing. And Alex Jones being very weird. Very weird. Okay. His headspace is so fucked up. And I think I've started to piece a few things together. I'm gonna give you some of this analysis upfront. Okay. I think that Alex Jones, more than being just a propagandist is someone who's tricked by propaganda very easily.

And one of the things he was asked was when did the FBI become first aware of Russian hacking and Russian influence campaigns? And his answer was summer of 2015, which is right around the era when we're talking about, okay, all right, I have noticed a lot of instances of Alex believing bullshit stories

And we'll see a bit of it over the course of this episode. But first, let's start in July 14. Alex Jones has an interesting ride on July 14, but he has one big announcement that he starts the show with. And this is very exciting. Oh, no, because I will get at the end of this clip, I will explain why this excites the shit out of me. I think you'll know, I think you'll Oh, yeah.

That's a rear of the first hour or some stations carry the second, third and fourth hour. It varies. But I am looking at bringing back I will announce here on air sometime this year, the fourth hour. But making the fourth hour an intense news broadcast our roundtable discussion where more than 50 news articles will be covered every day. Boom, boom, boom, throw the topic out. Get a quick comment from the people on the panel. Take a call. Go to the next story.

Roger Stone is gonna have a TV show. And Mike Cernovich is gonna get a show any moment now. Yeah. So I think there's reasons not to get too freaked out about Alex's stated plans in 2017 of having a TV network. I don't think we need to worry too much about that.

Well, it's been said many times, there are no atheists in foxholes. And when you read about babies wrapped in gold foil, shipped out of China by the 1000s every month and being turned into powder for women mainly to eat it, believing it makes them look younger. And nobody seems to care when you look at hundreds of millions of abortions every year worldwide. When you look at the globalist poisoning our food and water supply by design and forcing Gardasil shots on young girls all over the planet. When you look at our government funding ISIS and al Qaeda, when you look at the borders wide open and El Chapo, now we learn had his wife move here and have her baby so he'd have an anchor baby. The billionaire drug dealer, even lives off US taxpayers. I mean, it's a joke. I mean, so that's why I'm committed to fight as hard as I can. The British Special Forces slogan for the Special Air Services, the model of Special Forces worldwide, and they were the first to do it. shs is Fortune favors the bold? Well, I'm here to tell you I in the face of them coming after our guns coming after our health coming after everything. Fortune favors the bold what is our fortune? What made our fortune what made even prosperity and freedom? What that forbearers back down what is he talking used to be down there? A lot of them came from the Super Service of slavery, you name it, but they persevered to the point where at and our ancestors aren't losers. Whether you're black, whether you're white, whether you Hispanic or Asian, all peoples of the earth have incredible histories of incredible adversity and overcoming it. And that's why we're here today. The fact that your parents and their grandparents and their great great great, great grandparents, were able to have children and have them survive and pass that torch forward. And the fact that we're alive today, as a species and dominant on this planet is because we're winners, and I'm sick of people telling us we're not winners. I know. You're special supposed to be this is incredible, and incredible. God made you whether you believe in God or not look around you reality is fantastic. 12 dimensions they've decided here as believers probably lies in other dimensions. What do you think all this is? We only see a very narrow spectrum of light, just in the light spectrum of this dimension. The eye is not seen the ears not heard what God the universe whatever you want to call it has in store for us. And we're not going to let the globalist wall off reality put us in a matrix to control us dumb us down and then phase us out. Like we're a horse and buggy whip in 1920. And the factories are closing because nobody buys buggies and buggy whips and horses anymore. We are the innovators. We are the great creation, we are in the image of the Great Creator. We are special, we are powerful. And that's why the Fortune favors the bold wants to bring us down.

I don't remember the I don't remember the origin country. But the reason he was doing that is because China has a very interesting relationship with fetuses and babies, especially ones that have died. They have a whole tradition around abortion, where if you get an abortion, you're supposed to create a shrine to the baby and worship the fetus ghost oboes to appease the fetus, ghost, bring it food, and stuff like that to help it live in the other worlds.

In the Bible, furthered job 121 says Naked I came from my mother's womb and naked I will depart the Lord gave and the Lord is taken away. A lot of people interpret that to mean that the Lord gives you life and the Lord chooses when your life will end the Lord takes away when your life ends. First Corinthians 1013 He will not let you be tempted by more than you can bear but when you are tempted God will also give you a way to escape that temptation.

The six Democratic members on the panel walked out of the meeting in protest before the vote. The committee's final report recommended the quote, The National Institutes of Health be required to stop funding fetal tissue research, and that the huge health provider Planned Parenthood be stripped of us funding. According to science, the publication science, the report contained multiple inaccuracies. Democratic members of the panel who had not been permitted to read respond to or vote on the final report released an alternate report in which they criticized the committee for relying on McCarthy Era tactics, and a relying on unsourced unverified documents and writing of the report.

The problem is, I don't trust him as far as I can throw him but he's got to be given the benefit of the doubt. Because he shared with the other Republicans won't show I'm going to stop attacking Donald Trump. I've warned. But that said he's better than anything else we see right now. Sure what he's saying has to be supported and defended. Thank you for listening more important in the man. It's the idea. I think he's gonna betray us. That's what my gut tells me. And spot he's never wrong.

Second of all, I get irritated because I'm off the grid down there. I live 900 miles in Mexico. And whenever somebody with the statute of Donald Trump makes a statement like he has, believe me, we as Americans down there feel the repercussions of that. All of a sudden Mexican people stare at us. All of a sudden, you know, hassle start happening, maybe the federal rallies pull you over bar, whatever it might be, but it does nobody any good, because what Donald Trump is saying does nothing but anger, Mexican people, because you can't take them in a broad brush.

Hmm, not so much. For some people, the phrase brown bag calls up ugly associations with the use of the expression brown bag to determine if people's skin color was light enough to allow admission to an event or a home citizens is a different case, we sometimes use it as another way of saying members of the public, except for all the members of the public who aren't actually citizens who live and work here.

And this is because saying boys and girls are hurtful to trans identifying students, which doesn't make any sense. He's stupid. But here's the thing. If you look into it, this is based on a story out of Lincoln, Nebraska specifically. And there were some materials that were provided to teachers by a group called the gender spectrum, which is an organization whose website states a goal of fostering, quote, gender sensitive and inclusive environment for all children and teens. So inside their materials, it has this I'll just read this, quote, don't use phrases such as boys and girls, you guys, ladies and gentlemen, and similarly, gendered expressions to get kids attention, instructor training document given to middle school teachers at the Lincoln public schools, create a classroom, create classroom names, and then ask all the purple penguins to meet on the rug. The document also warns against asking students to line up as boys and girls and suggest asking them to line up whether they prefer skateboards or bikes, milk or juice dogs or cats summer or winter talking or listening.

The materials were provided as guidelines for educators to better understand gender identity issues, and were not intended to impose rules mandating how those issues should be addressed. Quote, The handouts provided by a staff member on a district equity team were meant only for teachers, not for students or parents who said and hoarse. And they were not meant as rules staff had to follow. But as suggestions for how teachers can make students feel comfortable, it also stresses the impact words can have on others. If there's a staff member that's uninformed and unsupportive, that can be a pretty scary, that can be pretty scary for a family, maybe struggling to understand transgender issues themselves. So that just sounds like a really good progressive school district, quite frankly.

In fact, never once has anyone inside our school mandated that a teacher take the words boys or girls or ladies and gentlemen, out of their interactions with children or interacting with adults, of course, this was about adults, professional educators who care deeply about trying to reach and establish relationships with children.

The Police Chief William Wright tells news eight The reason no one was arrested was because the items were being sold on private property. Not to mention, not to mention, no lots of guard no laws were broken because of course, there was a table set up with this material right says according to the journal record, it's not criminally illegal, but obviously it offended this person. It causes some people a sense of being uncomfortable. Certainly the owner could preclude this merchandise. You said he could if you wanted if you and the owner. Yeah, it's a choice do that. Yeah. The town resident who called 911 said that there were helmets with swastikas images of Hitler and other historical Nazi items. Quote, I was shaking and almost vomiting. He tells the paper I had to run my hood. My grand not turn on the History Channel. My grandmother had numbers. He said referring to the digits Nazis would tattoo on their prisoner. Oh shit, the caller complained that the Confederate items were quote, not authentic. And replicas of flags and weapons. He said the seller told him he was quote selling so much he can't keep it in stock. So basically what happened? This has to be the story he's talking about. It's from around the same time. It's a flea market. It has to police coming in. I couldn't find any other stories. Nobody got arrested for selling the flag, right? He's just completely making that part up out of whole cloth.

He's fucking talk. He's trying to weave his narrative that he has built up in the past that it turns them on people who are pro abortion have some sort of a sexual thing about killing babies. Yeah, it's all nonsense, but he's trying to make this lie match up with his pre existing lie. And it doesn't work if you watch the videos that doesn't match up at all. Now also he says that they are driving Lamborghinis. The lady says she wants a Lamborghini. There's no indication that she has one right and who cares if they're drinking wine, you asshole.

We see little evolution in his feelings towards Donald Trump, except to say that maybe someone loves some bigotry. He does love that and maybe someone told him to stop talking about his mob ties. Right. I didn't speculate about that earlier, but I might as well. The stuff that he was saying about Trump before this was basically vague accusations of crime reps. Yeah, so there's a decent chance someone was like, Dude, you got to stop that.

We are getting close to August, where the first debate happened. Right. So we'll see again, Roger Stone is not shown up yet. Ready? pedantic is not there. I actually want to make this clear what I remember that on our last episode. We didn't spell this out enough we danced around it a little bit. And let me see if I can find the best way to say this. Alex needs to be lied to in order to get on board with Trump whole hog because of the things he knows about him and the lack of trust right he knows about these connections that he has to mobs he knows about Russia connections, x y&z So in order for him to get on board, what we said is he needs another compelling thing, which we speculated would be this culture war stuff. Ah, I regret that I didn't point out that that Steve Botanics role in the whole con Steve pathetic is there to give the Russia didn't hack this stuff. It was patriots within our government. Okay, so Steve magenic. Is there functionally as the cover for those lies that Roger Stone is going to tell him? Okay, that's what I think. All right. But it's probably more likely it's just bigotry.
