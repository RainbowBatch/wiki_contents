This bill in the House was just grandstanding for the conservative base and an attempt to come up with a headline exactly like the one Alex is covering, while also being an opportunity to attack access to reproductive health care. They did the same thing in 2019. And it went nowhere except to rile up the base and to demonize the Democrats who voted against this pointless bill meant to stir up conflict. Yeah, anyway, there's no way this bill will pass the Senate. So it's kind of a moot point outside of the play that it gets in far right medium. This specific bill was introduced by Representative and Wagner of Missouri who also introduced this same bill in January 2021 and march 2019.

    | timestamp = 00:23:43.000
    | text      = movie producer. Yes, yeah, Alex is making an interesting pitch to MTG here, but the reality is that she's very publicly sided against that small group that Alex wants to flex their power. I wouldn't be too surprised to see her occasionally find common cause with them. But in terms of the big picture, she made her position entirely clear, and that was that she sides with the part of the party that can actually get something done, as opposed to the side that's all about stalling and obfuscation. I'm loathe to call MTG smart, but there's a common that's being displayed here. We talked in the past about how she served an incredibly useful role for the GOP in the context of a Democratic controlled House. Even if she was attacking Republicans. She was able to cause huge scenes and getting to embarrassing fights with other members of Congress, and it all worked to delay any possibility of Democrats getting anything done. However, that role is not useful once the GOP is in charge of the house and all of the stalling and grandstanding is being directed at them. Marjorie knew exactly when to change strategies and I think she made the right call for herself. The extreme right wing community she was getting in bed with was always going to turn on her eventually. You don't stay on people like Nick Fuentes is good side for very long and for people like that. If you're are not as extreme as the most extreme people in the movement, you're an option to be branded as a sellout if they need it. Yeah, you can, you're expendable. If you're dealing with people like Matt gates and Lauren bowburn It's probably really smart to exit that game of brinksmanship and make a very public statement. In the speaker vote. That's almost certainly the best time that she could have done that. Now, unfortunately, this does come with some downsides. She's going to lose the knotty folks who were her primary base up till this point. The good news there is that her district is so strongly Republican that as long as she wins her primary, she's essentially guaranteed reelection. By buddying up with McCarthy in the GOP establishment Marjorie has made it much less likely that she's going to end up running in a primary against a challenger who has support from the Republican establishment and the party and the fundraising and all that so she's probably kind of a big deal for her. Other folks are going to be in a bind here though people like Alex MTG is somebody that he's supported heavily because she has been willing to come on the show. He wants that access to power and proximity to it but the more he pursues connection with heard the more out of step with the audience he is going to become the extreme right thinks that he's a sellout and a shill which isn't great for the tip of the spear. The real interest in having her on and associated with the show lies in her popularity with the far right and as that erodes, it becomes less beneficial to have her on. Anyway, well played MTG probably the best thing she could have done for her political career. It's an interesting position for Alex to be put in though to see how long he sticks around here

It's a waste of everybody's fucking time. But then because she got enough of that power in there. Now she's got the support of the party system behind her regulatory capture man, now she's part of the very system because the system is the thing that protects her. That's what she wants to be part of not part of the crazies anymore. So the whole point of this is that they are exploiting the crazies to get to the place where they're safe and they don't have to listen to the crazies anymore.

A member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission just suggested looking into new regulations about gas stoves, after a meta analysis of studies concluded that gas stoves were associated with about 12% of youth asthma cases in the United States. How direct is that association? It's unclear but there are researchers who have drawn conclusions that are troubling. electric stoves are more safe from a few standpoints, and the major player in the push to fight against these regulations against gas is naturally the fossil fuel industry. Obviously, these fossil fuel companies have lobbied hard against regulations, even though studies have been coming out for at least the past 30 years demonstrating health risks associated with gas stoves. But in addition to that political action, they've also engaged PR firms to pose as normal people to create culture war agitation, inciting them toward being defensive about their gas stove

I go, Whoa, those anomalies are was professors and people were wrong. I think it happened. Nobody should me. No one Joe Rogan apologized, do a whole apology to her. Because I wasn't sophisticated back then I'm like, Yeah, I think it happened. I barely covered it. Then they sue me. Once I apologize. They have a judge in Texas, in Austin is in Liberal San Francisco and in Connecticut, sue me, then I give them all my text all my documents which they show in court. I gave them no documents. They default me first time in modern US history. I'm found guilty by judges and juries then have hearings on how guilty I am. Then they have a false financial expert get up and say I'm worth $400 million. At the time. They did that six months ago in that hearing in Texas.

Anytime someone like Alex is being told that he needs to accept that his actions have consequences, some switch gets flipped, or all of a sudden they're on death row. It's ridiculous. It's a straw man tactic. But in the case of Alex, I suspect it's also an expression of his narcissism, it would probably be threatening to his ego to recognize that at the end of the day, the plaintiffs in this case and most of the rest of the world just want him to be an adult and take responsibility for his actions and then everyone will move on to the best of their ability.

What, what I'm saying is, I think you're right, in some sense, but the supply side is impossible to deal with. And that's why I think the demand side is more of a fruitful place to try and make inroads. Sure, sure, sure. The the he is the supplier of this stuff, and you cannot get him to stop, he will not stop. He claims he has 15 Giant offers. That's not true. But he could, you know, still do a podcast or whatever, he's never going to retire to a farm. Like he pretends to want to Sure, sure, sure. That's not going to happen. And so the best you can really do is create as much of an awareness about who he actually is. And the fact that he is scamming his audience and all this is bullshit.

I think often it can be a little bit dangerous in as much as like having him on with Rogan being cool and Bros and stuff chair that portrays Alex in a light that is the fraudulent and makes him more appealing to people who maybe otherwise wouldn't be drawn towards his brand of fundamentalist ass. Weird demonology. Sure. Same thing with the Glenn Greenwald interview. This is presented him as somebody who should be taken seriously. Right, the documentary itself is a fraud on his positions and his who he is, you know, there's a lot of that. And I think that those people are definitely more culpable in the way that you're describing, with peers. I think, first of all, they have a history with each other. Second, I don't think that this interview in any way is going to make Alex look cool. And I don't think that it's in the reach that piers may have. I don't know if it's going to introduce Alex to a an audience that is likely to be drawn into his shit. Right. And the final point, I think beers has a reason he thinks he's doing this, whether or not it's worthwhile, whether or not it's a good idea. I do think that there's something he's trying to get to, in a way that a lot of other interviews, maybe don't have a point. This doesn't have a point. Right. But Pierce thinks it has a point, right? Therefore, I can understand why he's doing it. Right.
