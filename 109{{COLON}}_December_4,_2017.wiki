Today, Dan tells Jordan all about the December 4th episode of The Alex Jones Show. The episode will live in all our memories as "that time Alex Jones tried to pretend he wanted dissenters to call in, then avoided the minimal valid criticism a caller threw his way and started to fake crying talking about masculinity." Also, Jordan screams about the tax bill.
