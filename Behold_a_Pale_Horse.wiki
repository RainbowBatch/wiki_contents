"Behold a Pale Horse" is a 1991 book written by [[Bill Cooper]]. The book is a conspiracy theory manifesto that claims to expose various government secrets and cover-ups, ranging from the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] to alleged plans for a [[New World Order]].

The book's claims have been widely criticized and dismissed-- they lack evidence and rely on unreliable sources. Despite this, the book has gained a cult following among conspiracy theorists and has had a major influence on the development of the modern conspiracy theory movement.
