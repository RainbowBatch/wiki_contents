On July 29th, 2022, during the trial for [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|Heslin v. Jones]] (and days before [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|the Connecticut Sandy Hook Case]] was due to go to trial), [[Free Speech Systems LLC|Free Speech Systems]], the main company associated with [[InfoWars]] filed for Chapter 11 Section V bankruptcy protections.

This paused all litigation against FSS. FSS indicated, however, that it would ask for the Heslin v. Jones trial to continue. It of course intended for Lafferty v. Jones, which would have started  jury selection on August 1st, to be blocked.

On the same day the bankruptcy paperwork was signed, Alex filed a cross claim in Connecticut, indicating that he was suing Free Speech Systems for violating a supposed contract between himself and FSS (multiple courts have declared that FSS is an alter-ego of Jones, so they cannot form a meaningful contract) which would protect him from paying damages for his on-air conduct.

The case will be overseen by Federal Bankruptcy [[Judge Chris Lopez]].
