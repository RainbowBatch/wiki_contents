Second, the case accuses Alex of slightly different violations and has a bit more to do with the business end of his his operations. So there's a bit more there a bit more meat that you can look at.

It is exactly that norm is Alex's lawyer.

And it really gave me a sense that as bad as Alex's lawyer wasn't Austin, he at least had some boundaries. It didn't seem like it at the time until I saw norm and realized how shitty Raynal could have been if he had wanted to eight is crazy.

    | text      = This is an interesting tack that norm is trying here because he's essentially arguing that Alex is simultaneously really serious and important and on the right track, but he's also a raving madman who you should just ignore. At first glance, this seems like a message message that Alec shouldn't endorse. But if you think about it a little more, you can see how this is exactly the kind of ambiguity that Alex wants to cultivate about himself in official circles. For his audience, he's serious all the time. And all that stuff about chemtrails and shit is very much sincere and real. Yes, but for the rest of us, and in a courtroom that isn't going to fly. So a different tactic needs to be employed. And it's that sometimes he's serious. And sometimes you should just write off what he's saying is crazy. It's a perfect way to evade any responsibility for anything you say. But simultaneously allow yourself to feel like a big boy hero about things you want to be taken seriously for. There's an uncertainty about whether or not any particular thing Alex says should be taken seriously. And that works really well in this context. talking shit about social media being too powerful, take that deadly seriously. And recognize that Alex was way ahead of the curve on that. And he was essentially a prophet, claiming that murdered children's family members or actors and the whole thing didn't really even happen. Come on. He's crazy. You can't take what he's saying. Seriously, you can see how this game that norm is playing works. It's very transparent. Yeah. And I want to take this one step further. I do think that the things that norm is listing off as the crazy stuff Alex says that you should discount as the ravings of a madman are things that you should absolutely take seriously. Alex isn't someone on a street corner is nor wants to imply just talking to himself about outlandish theories. Alex is a multimillionaire businessman who's great at a career out of disseminating these outlandish theories to masses of people. He's not someone on a street corner. He's a demagogue with international reach and the race things that are just supposed to be ignored. Those aren't things that his audience is supposed to know that Alex, his lawyer would describe that way in court. These are very serious, very real, completely documented conspiracies that are aimed at killing you and your family. This isn't up for debate on Alex's show, but mysteriously when you're in a formal setting, surrounded by people who aren't indoctrinated into the fold, these are examples of things that Alex says that prove you shouldn't take what he says seriously. The ludicrousness of the things Alex says is used as a defense against him taking responsibility for the real world damage he causes. And I think that is something to take very seriously. Even beyond that, the thing is, norm is listing off a very fucked up conspiracy theories, many of which have their roots in anti semitic tropes from histories. The the eating of children and drinking their blood is a holdover from the blood libel, many of the conspiracies about poisoning the water in the air hearken back to well poisoning accusations about Jewish people intentionally spreading the bionic plague. Leaving aside these bigoted roots of his talking points, there are just very serious dangers in the way that a non insignificant number of people and some elected officials are using pedophilia accusations to rile up their followers into a state where they're causing real damage to people primarily aimed at members of the LGBTQ community. Even if we aren't supposed to take Alex's theories themselves seriously, if we are responsible members of the public, we do need to take the reason they're being spread seriously. We need to take the impact that they have seriously and the game norm is playing here is an attempt to run cover for that. And based on norms character, I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing. Because he's a piece of shit. Yeah, and he should rise above that sticks and stones, you know, very good bones and words don't hurt.

That book was not the best selling book in America. In fact, the best selling book in America last week was the great reset and the Warhammer world written by Oh my Jones.

    | text      = So one thing we should just get clear. Before I get into any of this is that for over a decade and probably way longer than that people have been a bit confused about how best seller lists work. There is not well, certainly a precise science to it. And if you look at different publications, you'll see different listings because they use different metrics. I went to check the New York Times list and sure enough, I'm glad my mom died is a number one but if there's some kind of a weird systemic bias on this list, I don't know how Jared Kushner his book breaking history is coming in at number three in its third week on the list. That seems strange. Yeah. Or what about number 13 on the list being the book battle for the American mind by Peter Giggs, if and David Goodwin which is described as quote, The Fox and Friends Weekend host makes his case for what he calls a classical Christian at occasion seems like the time to just say no thank you to that if they're just manipulating their shit. Yeah, given these inclusions I just don't believe for a second that there's like a systematic bias against Alex's book. No, of course not. There's one factor that I think is working against Alex, and that is that a ton of his books are being purchased directly from his website at a giant markup. Oh, yeah. And he's complained quite a bit about how he asked to sign them all before shipping them out. On his Wednesday show, he said that he sold 14,000 copies on his own website, Jesus Christ, these purchases through Infowars wouldn't be confirmed purchases, The Times would factor into the rankings partially because Infowars store doesn't report sales data to the time

    | text      = of how the times makes their list from their website about the lists methodology. Quote, rankings reflect unit sales reported on a confidential basis by vendors offering a wide range of general interest titles published in the United States, every week. 1000s of diverse selling locations report their actual sales on hundreds of 1000s of individual titles. The panel of reporting retailers is comprehensive and reflect sales in 10s of 1000s of stores of all sizes and demographics across the United States. So you know, they have like some smaller bit like operators, some smaller bookstores, some chains, yeah, Amazon, of course. And so they have these to get a sampling of where books are sold. Yeah, of course, this is where Alex is probably hurting. I would guess that he doesn't have like really great distribution for this book, and it's probably not being carried in many stores. He's got his own website and Amazon. And while a ton of book buying is done online, there is a wider picture that is often ignored. Alex's book is currently number five on Amazon's top seller list, which is great for him. That's just based on purchases, so it's a little more straightforward in terms of rankings. Incidentally, number four on that list is I'm glad my mom died. So he's not beating generic either. Heartbreaking also, number two is a cookbook written by Steve Doocy and his wife so really Dungar should be asking why is it the New York Times charts putting Steve Doocy up there?

This is just about him taking his own petty grievance and insecurity about feeling left out and pretend to get actually reveals a political point. He also very clearly sees the potential this has as a way to drive sales as the article on Infowars says, quote, The New York Times excluded Alex Jones as the great reset from its rightful place on the list. It's time to end the censorship of conservative voices from bestseller lists. Fuck me, that article is maybe 700 words long, and it includes six hyperlinks to the Amazon page to buy Alex. Also, I shouldn't know that all the book is 36% off its original price like a week into its release, which definitely doesn't scream. We fleeced people on pre orders, and now we're trying to sell off the rest of these books at a cut rate. Yeah, so they don't fill up the warehouse. Exactly. Alex did well, he cashed in a bid on a book. And he should be proud of himself for turning his incoherent ramblings into 30, something 1000 books sold. But this whole thing is a bit much.

The argument is that these mandates may not avert that many hospitalizations, and I can see where that may make some sense. I think that'd be very reasonable if people under 40 and people over 40 Never came into contact with each other but seeing as we all do intermingle and vaccines are a community level solution to a problem not an individual level one. I have some issues with the just the very idea of this. Yeah, that being said half headline is bullshit. The study didn't say that vaccines are 98 times worse than the virus as Alex is repeating that number 98 is used In the paper is the high end estimate of the number of serious adverse events you might expect to see in a hypothetical College of 30,000 students who are all given the booster, right. Also, this paper hasn't been peer reviewed. So their numbers and methodology might be suspect probably

Either way, that's as close as it gets in this beat right into that lay. In that speech.

So I searched for the words he was saying and imagine my surprise when I found that he's just reading the headline for the article on Infowars. That includes the embedded video of the show that he's in the middle of doing. This is just a headline Alex himself has written for this day's show. And you can see the exact same wording reposted on tons of really shady looking blogs, all of which are just reposting Alex's video. But weirdly, none of them have links to these documents in this Israeli study. That is supposed to be the bombshell. So I did a little digging around and I found what Alex is covering and it's just another post on Steve Kershaw's subsidizes Christ. There's a video on rumble that purports to be from the Israeli health ministry having a meeting where they discuss findings that are that, that there are some longer term side effects of the Pfizer vaccine that hadn't been known previously, findings which are being said to have been covered up by Pfizer and the Israeli government. Sure, I can't find coverage of this on any outlet that I find even halfway respectable and I don't speak Hebrew. So I don't know what's being said in this video, right. The context in the original narrative framework for this story traces back to a post on Twitter by a woman named Yaffa Shira Roz, who is credited generally as a health and risk communications researcher and a health journalist. This translates to her running a website called Real Time news, which is kind of it comes off as an Israeli version of a lot of the dicey sources that I run into on this show things like World Net Daily.

The CDC had made some comments that they had used a data analysis method called proportional reporting ratio, or PRR. But in fact, they only use that method between March 25 2002 And July 31 2022. As is clarified in the letter from the CDC director to Senator Ron Johnson, who is questioning her about this, quote, CDC and FDA chose to rely on empirical Bayesian data mining more robust technique used to analyze disproportionate reporting, rather than PRR calculations to mitigate potential false signals. CDC performed PRR analysis between March 25 And July 31 2022. to corroborate the results of the EB data mining, notably results from PRR analysis were generally consistent with EB data mining revealing no additional unexpected safety signals. This isn't a story about the CDC not monitoring data, it's just about them using a different methodology that they felt was more useful and possibly someone Miss speaking at some point in the past.

This is about a high school student named Kaden climber who had a large blood clot and multiple nowhere in the story doesn't mention climbers vaccination status. Alex is just making that up because he has a vested interest in reporting every story about a young person who gets hurt as being the consequence of their getting vaccinated. Right. He can't make his point by discussing reality. So he just makes up whatever works best for him so he can keep his audience scared and in his way, incidentally, the CBN story includes this that Alex never talks about doesn't mention this at all. Quote, it's unclear what caused the extensive clots in his body but doctors diagnosed Climber with a condition called inferior vena cava at tree Xia. Just disorder can be acquired or congenital. Even the CBN is letting you know that there's a decent chance climber was born with this condition. Right? I looked up other sources on the story and no one mentions whether or not he was vaccinated. I did find a lot of angry blogs saying that the fact that stories don't say whether he was vaccinated as proof that he is and they're covering it up, I think that's dumb. Yeah. Also in July 2021, Ohio, where this high school is located passed a law prohibiting mandates for public schools, so there's literally no reason to just automatically assume that he was vaccinated. Alex doesn't care about the reality of the situation. To him. This story is useful if the kid was vaccinated, so he can make it look like this as a consequence of vaccination. So he doesn't need any proof to justify reporting that he was. That's how simple his brain is and how little he cares about what he tells his audience.

As a consequence of their default sanctions, Alex aside isn't permitted to make certain claims which they could have contested and raised in an actual trial, if they hadn't engaged in a very clear pattern of malicious non participation with the discovery process.

So there is that now, the judge in Texas didn't turn off the internet feeds and lecture Alex's lawyer for hours that's just completely made up and actually might be defamatory. Chris Mehdi, the plaintiff's lawyer here in Connecticut did say that a fitting punishment for Alex is to get him off air to make it so he can't profit off hurting people in the future. That could possibly be argued to be a little bit out there in terms of an opening, but I think it's fine. It's a damages hearing, and the lawyer is saying that fitting damages would be to impose whatever punishment makes Alex unable to continue doing this damage in the future. Alex is also misrepresenting the issue with normes questioning of the FBI agent who was the first witness called by the plaintiffs that had to do with Norm asking inappropriate questions about whether or not he was one of the people in Connecticut who had petitioned NBC to not air the Megyn Kelly interview, right? It wasn't trying to take Alex off air per se. And Alex himself filmed a bunch of videos where he was trying to get that interview pulled. So I don't even know what the point is here. Also, Norm had no reason to believe that the guy was involved in that and his conduct was way out of line. It was part of a chain of things. He got reprimanded for where he was trying to present to the jury that Alex is only getting sued because of Hillary Clinton, putting a target on him basically the premise of that cool documentary, Alex's war.

In order to and the presenting things as a fundraiser. Sure, the overpriced pneus of the coin, the markup on the book and stuff. These things are in order to create the appearance of a business doing well. So he can coast through the bankruptcy court and make it he won't be able to keep it up after that. No. But then ideally, I guess, his image of it is that like, they won't crush me. I'll just not have money to give them a leader or something. It's a bad strategy, but I also think it's, it feels fraudulent.
