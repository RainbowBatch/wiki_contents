Today, Dan tells Jordan about a really good example of how Alex Jones has literally no standards about who he allows on his show as a guest. This is not news, but today's example is the very hateful pastor Steve Anderson, who Alex Jones has on to discuss whether or not the rapture comes before or after the tribulation. As is so often the case, there are far more important issues to discuss.
