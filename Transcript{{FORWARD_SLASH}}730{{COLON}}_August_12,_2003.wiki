There is that Shrivers mother Eunice was JFK sister. Right, right. I also have no idea what kind of books Arnold was writing before 2003.

So anything you want to discuss, it's it's wide open phones, if you disagree with me, if you want to confront me, if you want to show that I'm a liar, and that government is holy, and that government can do no wrong, and that it's conservative to turn your guns in. I disagree with that. I believe it's not conservative to have open borders and to turn your guns in and to be for an abortion. But again, I'm one of those old fashioned conservatives.

And then at the end, he goes into the basement and there's the gun club huddled around something whispering he says watch that they don't show it is that they say oh, it's it's a machine we're building to defeat the New World Order.

He has really basic plot points wrong like how it was Niles, not Fraser who got into guns, or more importantly, that it wasn't a gun club. It was that Niles and his dad went to a shooting range. The bigger aspect that Alex is really missing with this episode is that the shooting range and guns are treated as totally normal, safe and actually fun. Fraser's dad has a routine of going shooting and Niles is a stick in the mud. But after firing a gun, he realizes that it's really enjoyable and not that scary. Nothing about guns or even an issue that the episode makes look bad. It's the people that he met at the shooting range that are a weirdo New World Order dudes. And that wouldn't have even really been a problem except they were trying to get nails to come to their compound in Idaho, which is why Frazier's dad was worried in the first place.

Notice they always called it and this means now in any case, that your lawyer when you're there giving him information or preparing your case will go report on you to the prosecution and to the judge. Now. That is a 180 from what America was found it to be but it doesn't matter. They all wrap that in American flag. Patriotic if you don't do it.

If Alex actually thinks that level four labs are for weaponized things that explains a lot of his dumb ideas, but he's just making that up. The distinction between level three and four are the things that are studied in level four labs are, quote, infectious agents or toxins that pose a high risk of aerosol transmitted laboratory infections and life threatening diseases for which no vaccine or therapy is available. Both use very high levels of safety protocols, but understandably, for things that are, you know, studied and level four, they need greater control, right? Smallpox and Ebola are absolutely not level three pathogens. They're studied in level four labs. Yeah, he's just, he has no idea of the things he's talking about.

We stopped in front of the garage and Quinn pulled up behind us. I opened my door and started to exit the car. Quinn stepped out of his car and yelled for me to remain in the car. Rather than cause a scene I remained seated in the car and close the door. No, it's Quinn was talking on the radio. I asked Rachel How to handle the situation. She had no answer. We both realized that it had been five years since being stopped and I was pretty rusty. Two unmarked cars arrived within moments. One of the persons in the first car was the chief of police quit and approached this my side of the car and stood slightly behind me. He asked to see my driver's license and registration.
