Today, Dan and Jordan dip back into the past of the Alex Jones Show to explore how he behaved in the days and weeks after Sandy Hook. In this installment, the gents uncover a really important development in Alex's path toward calling the victims actors, and in the process find three interviews completely unrelated to Sandy Hook that can only be described as "trash."
