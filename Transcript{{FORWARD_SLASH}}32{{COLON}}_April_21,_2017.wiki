And so someone pointed this out, he didn't delete the tweet, he didn't apologize. And a day later, when he was hosting the Alex Jones Show brought it up. Why won't CNN say that this guy is black, so

And I gotta be honest, without the quick editing that he does in his videos that he puts out, he's not ready for primetime. Baby. He is not good at that desk. Okay, he's not there yet. Because he relies so much on quick edits, that just having him speak for 10 minutes. Who are not good. No personality. No, it he has no ENT which is fucking fully demonstrated by the he had a time where he was on air with with Leon McAdoo, right I've already here love of your life, but who I've already said is a zero in terms of like her abilities.

Typically, whenever a secondary leader comes, that's when things go off the rails. That's when shit turns into, like suicide pact. Yeah, so I think that if Alex does end up going down and you end up with a new leader ascending, you'll just you'll see it fall apart much quicker. But I still think here's what I think. Alex Jones has done a really good job of building up individuals that fit certain demographics as his team. So you have Owen Troyer, who's kind of like a frat boy who's kind of like a cool, bro.

And they have that there because the FCC will find them if someone swears on air or something like that. That's the that's the Janet Jackson tip rule, right. But it's always been in place in radio. Like I remember, I didn't know that. When I remember when I was listening to love line when I was younger, they would have chops, that would end up happening, just because someone swore and then they had to kick them off the air, okay, and the swear would never make it through to air unless tons of people kept calling in and swearing, and they would eat up the seven second delay. That's pretty great. That is a thing that can happen. That's pretty great. Right? So but the problem with that is that guy could have just said fuck you or something like that. Yeah. Or he could have threatened bill. We don't know that. Right. So the the idea that he's saying, I don't agree with your position I'm gonna send security to you is not fair.

And this tracks I'll just read their explanation of what affinity means. This is a comparison of the audience composition of this property. In this case property means infowars.com, or audience segment to the Okay, so it's a comparison of the audience composition of Infowars. To the internet's population at large. The higher the affinity number is, the more concentrated the Infowars is in a particular geographic area. For example, if Infowars has an affinity of 10, times 10, multiplier of 10. For San Francisco, that means that a given visitor is 10 times more likely to be from San Francisco as any internet user chosen at random. Okay, so I gotcha. And affinity of point five times means the visitor is half as likely yes. So I looked at the statistics, and when something really jumped up at me, because in the United States, the affinity ranking is 1.98 times. Okay, so it's twice as likely as a random internet user to be a United States.

He said I attended the UT sleep specialist Delta ut professor. I've been to everybody. I can't sleep for years. It's incredible workaholic. I don't drink coffee because I just might make me not sleep. He goes I took your knockout formula. And he said I've done everything tested the drugs you name it, none of it worked. And he said it actually reset my But he was like he's 10 years younger, literally. And he said, This totally changed my world. Why is it so much better than when I just bought melatonin to the store? And I said, I figured if we just took melatonin l tryptophan, Valerian root and all these other key things that are known as natural and healthy and organic sources of this that have been known for 1000s of years to eat and sleep, lemon balm, chamomile, all of it together. At the normal, same dosage isn't each one all supercharged, all into one that'd be absolutely explosive. And with good people amazing sleep. And he said, Yeah, it's changed my life. I want to come on here and endorse it. So this gentleman, it should be $50. One bottle of melatonin of the same strength is his 1995. We have the same dose in there. And then everything else you need, and it's all organic, with absolutely no fillers. Just understand that that's why we're such game changers. We do the research, we do the research to bring you the products that nobody else was, will do with the top scientists, you name it. top producers, personally, I came up with a knockout and then worked with others to you know, pick the best sources. But I'm really really proud of it. It was just some little side issue that I thought sometimes I mix Valerian with with melatonin it really works together. So what did we add everything together? I checked with the experts to make sure none of it interacted wrong, and they were just like, oh my god, still consult your physician not available.
