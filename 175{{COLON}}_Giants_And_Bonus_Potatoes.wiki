Today, Dan needs to save Jordan from the awful flavor of the modern world, so he decides to branch things out and explore a new con-man on the show, the one and only Jim Bakker. To make it relevant to the podcast, the gents discuss an episode of Bakker's show where he talked to frequent Alex Jones guest Steve Quayle about a whole lot of nonsense, but weirdly not much about Jesus.

==Tidbits==

*Steve Quayle discusses the lineage of giants
*Steve talks about cyber attacks
*Jim Bakker is basically Alex but more religious and selling way more
*Jim runs a scam college
