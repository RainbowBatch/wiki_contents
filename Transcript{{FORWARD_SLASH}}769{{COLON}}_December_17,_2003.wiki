The publication is named after Harry Elmer Barnes and old school Holocaust denier, and the content that they put out is straight trash. It strains credulity for me to believe that someone could get their news from TBR news.org and not be aware of the outlets, editorial beliefs. Here are some of the headlines from that website around this time. Quote, news of candidate's Jewish roots adds another flavor to campaign quotes how the Holocaust Industry stole the Swiss monies a shockingly high number of books that they have on their reading list so they do have a reading list.

Yeah, this is where that really is true. Yeah. Because if you tried to have a conversation with Alex about like Bush grabbing guns and stuff, you couldn't possibly because you're just dealing with the term completely differently. Yeah. And I think that extends to like 100% of the things Alex talks about, yes. 100%. I think that exactly. I think that's maybe one of the big reasons why it's almost pointless to like, try and talk to him about any issues, like debating him or debating.

And it was a very flawed policy. I understand that I may be bringing this up a bunch as we go through this timeframe. But I think it's important to recognize that in addition to all the many instances of things that Alex is wrong about, there are also narratives like this, that he has just constructed reality to sell his audience that are the inverse of the real world. Yeah, he's getting mad about the CPA, putting the Baptist back into power. So he should conceivably be glad to hear that this is not in fact, happen at all. But here's the problem. I think this goes a long way towards clearing up why Alex is so insistent on this false reality here, Alex is trapped. Imagine that he acknowledges the real world and de bath suffocation. He needs to have an angle on it and nothing works. Alex isn't equipped to express opposition to the bath suffocation and has already told the audience repeatedly that Saddam and his party are essentially globalist CIA shield as true supporting deep bath applications is even worse, since the architects of that plan are the very people he spends all day on air decrying his secret Trotskyites. Yet people like Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, Alex can't be on the same page as them is only real option is to pretend it's all fake, which is what he's done by constructing the illusion that two thirds of the bath party members are being put into power in December 2003. In some ways, Alex is lazy and stupid, but sometimes he's doing the only thing he can within the confines he's restricted himself to thanks to his laziness and stupidity. Yeah, man, I don't even know if I think that that's a conscious process or anything, right. But I'm looking at this and like, it does make sense that those angles are just roads that are blocked, right, there isn't any way to proceed forward on those roads. Whereas this one, you can go down it it's a dumb road, right? It's not real.
