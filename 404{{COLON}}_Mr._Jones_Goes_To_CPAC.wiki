Today, Dan and Jordan discuss Alex Jones' horribly misguided rally at CPAC. It was an event full of real dumb weirdos, from doomed congressional candidates and longshot grifters to Nick Fuentes. The goal was to get Trump's attention about the cause of free speech, but the end result is probably everyone waking up the next day not feeling like they did a good job.
