'''Harry Dent''' is a very dicey economic expert.

Harry Dent frequently appears on Alex's show, suspiciously almost always to make claims about how financial collapse is right around the corner. For example, in [[57: August 12-16, 2015|August of 2015]], he claimed "we are probably a week away from a complete collapse." Spoiler alert: this prediction did not come to pass.

Dent is using very irresponsible rhetoric on a show that is broadcast by a gold sales company, with a host who is constantly telling his audience that they need to buy gold to be safe when the economy collapses (as Alex does many times on this episode).
