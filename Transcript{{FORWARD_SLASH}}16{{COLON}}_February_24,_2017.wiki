Finally, the intelligence agencies and other patriot groups ensured Hillary couldn't fully steal the election, she did steal part of it. And so now they're in such panic mode that he's going to have in their program as if Hillary still got elected. And that's why the government and the shadow government is behaving as if Trump doesn't exist. The American people don't exist with total arrogance, but they're failing. We have the initiative, we have the upper hand, we have justice and the right side of history on our side, and destiny. But most important, pray to God and get on your knees and repent for everything you've done. I do as well humble ourselves for the Lord and ask God for guidance and deliver scales for our fellow countrymen and women's eyes, and others around the globe. I'm Alex Jones. This is the info war and you are the key, the critical anchor that whole thing in the last two days we've seen massive, unprecedented support coming in, since the Google bandits through had rolled from being able to online advertising, just incredible. jackboot chilling effects, censorship.

So it's a chilling effect of our free speech and of what we're trying to do not letting us enter the market. Just like for a decade, we fought this. We don't sell guns, but we fought it. Sell guns now. You got gun dealers but major gun shops than sporting goods stores. First, it was little small gun dealers, you know, Mom and Pop outfits, you know adult storefronts. They ban those and those magazines, TV ads, radio ads, did a lot of places, newspapers all got together and banned those. That's about 1520 years ago, everybody remembers that. And then there was sporting goods stores. And then they just said no guns advertised period anywhere. Okay. Now some magazines would say oh, we'll take an insert and still do it and get around that as people file lawsuits. So they're blocking your access to the market. It's racketeering. It's like block blocking little black kids from going into the school in Alabama. Or a places like Arkansas 1959 shame the Oh I knew you're saying you're not allowed in this restaurant, you're not allowed this train station, you don't get service in this hotel. Get out of here. No, not at all your ads violate our rules. You Your website is political and you're not allowed to make money, go into a corner and die.

And you know, che literally let adult men come in the shower with your daughter or your hateful that is promoting pedophilia. But they play these games with the with the terms. Nambla basically runs the UN folks, okay. And they're so scared. They're getting caught now that they're trying to normalize it and say, Well, you're not just transgender. You're not just this no, you like kids or you identify as a kid when you're a 50 year old pig like, man, so somebody's eight year old daughters. Okay. Well, then my 357 Magnum and the bullets that come out of it in a fight with your head. These bullets identify as your brain tissue. Know that okay, do you want to go you know, with your ding dongs hanging out little girls, is it okay, if Smith and Wesson identifies as your brain tissue? I mean, I'm just asking. The headline will be Joe's threatens to kill transgenders. I didn't say that. I said they use the whole transgender thing to say, let men come and showers with little girls or you're not tolerant. That's pedophilia, what's being pushed? I don't care who says it. Or if it's some asshole on CNN, excuse me, I've never used a lot of profanity on air tech. This is Christian show, and I apologize, and I'm gonna stop it. But I gotta tell you, there aren't names or words strong enough to describe people like that. I'm gonna play that clip too. But let's play somebody who's actually trying to get jobs and turn our energy back on and bring us together. Someone who isn't up there telling us the number one issue is grown men with little girls have showers. Because of little girls don't like seeing men's penises. They're bad people. These are quotes okay. Now their natural weak mind is they think we are yes, CNN. They're not. I happen to have a 12 year old daughter. Let me immediately make sure that I will. No doubt I catch a grown man in the shower with one of my daughters. I will beat your brains out with my bare hands guaranteed. Oh my god so hateful. That's right.

And of course you know the classic thing of a male you could have three heads on a male's shoulders, and only another head on a woman's shoulder, or one half of the head on each side. That's a well known thing and anatomy. And I saw a online video that I made earlier today and we may look into this talking about Michelle Obama, looking like a man. And now they only released photos of her with their hands up covering her shoulders, or her turned at an angle. And I started looking at it with Joan Rivers saying she's a transvestite. And I've been hearing this for years and I thought, come on. I know Obama was raised by a transvestite in the rest of it and I'm not getting into bashing people. That's not my cup of tea. It is really last minute look at videos of this and look at photos over and the official White House photo. And she looks like an NBA senator. I mean, she looks more like Shaquille O'Neal than a black woman and no weirdness and that we don't even know Ray silly isn't a social security numbers don't racist and then his dad clearly we sell the documentary dreams of my real father enemy with the famous pornographer who lives in Hawaii, whose grandfathers was best buddies with and who Obama would stay the summers with a famous communist pornographer.

I don't think I think that's what he's saying. How about we volunteer them to go in there?

It's like, okay, you can make that argument and still be on solid ground. Yeah. But once you get into this territory of, you know, we should tweet at him, that sort of thing.
