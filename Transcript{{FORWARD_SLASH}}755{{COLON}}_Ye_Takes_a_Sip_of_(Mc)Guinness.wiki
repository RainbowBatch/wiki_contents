And for 90% of the game, she is the weakest, most useless character example being in this run. All right, on purpose. You have to fight a fight for about 45 minutes. Sure.

Because watching somebody beat something really fast with these glitches and things. It's like, I don't think it's interesting, I guess, but it's not fun to watch. Okay, hearing about it.

    | text      = That sounds right. Yeah. So Jordan, in a perfect world, we would never have to talk about this stuff ever again. Yeah, I was hoping that we were done Damn. Yeah, the public would recognize that yay. isn't saying anything new or interesting that Nick Fuentes is engaged in a large scale political project slash publicity stunt geared at further mainstream and Catholic fascism as a viable political entity, and that Alex Jones and all of his ilk are complicit in all of this. In a better world, people would see these kinds of actions as disqualifying and these actors would be cast off the stage of public life for the crime of being poor stewards of the public attention. But we live in a shitty world and gay can spout anti semitic shit for a month, and none of this stops. In that time he did an interview with Tucker Carlson that was so offensive that Tucker had to edit out large parts of it. So the clips that he did play match the narratives that he wanted to sell to his audience. He did an interview with Tim Poole, where he stormed out after 20 minutes because Poole wouldn't say that the Jews were out to get yea, he did a three hour stretch on Infowars, where he denied the Holocaust twice and constantly rebuked any of Alex's attempt to help sanitize his clearly anti semitic bullshit. And all this isn't enough to make him a persona non grata in the right wing because there's still something they want from him. Like Nick, they see the utility and associating with a lunatic bigot. And there are two major reasons for that, which we're going to discuss in greater detail today through two recent shows. And then just for fun, we'll listen to Nick shit on Alex.

I'm not sure if that idea that he has for is like to be a series. I don't know if that's a joke or not, but Gavin does say it at one point. It seems like the kind of thing he would do. The second A piece we're gonna look at is an interview that Alex did on louder with Crowder where Crowder announced that Alex was breaking his silence on the A interview. What that's not really accurate but who cares? Oh my god. Each of these two documents illustrates one of the dynamics that make yay and Nick's current media campaign incredibly important for them to engage in and ultimately also reveal how bad of an idea it is for these right wing figures to be getting involved at all. Apologies in advance for making you and the listeners hear Gavin and Crowder's voices, but in some ways, it's not my fault. It's not all my fault. I mean, partially might have

I'm going to talk them off the ledge and bring them back to the understanding that our problem is liberal elites of all races, Kamala Harris is a major problem. Barack Obama is a major Barack Obama is what started this whole mess, I would argue we weren't really into racism before he came along. To say, anti semitism is a rut.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:12:42.000
    | text      = So there's two important points here in this opening from Gavin. The first is that he has some kind of sense that racism really wasn't much of a thing before Obama, and that isn't even something Gavin believes or should be taken seriously, as a point he's making. Yeah, that's pandering to his racist audience that wants to believe that even if they have fucked up racist beliefs that are reported by the larger population, they only have them because a black man became president and made them become racist. Obama was instigating the racism. It's a load of shit. But there's actually something interesting about this formulation that he's putting forth. When Obama became president. It didn't create this new racism, but a lot of people use racist ideas to contextualize their political opposition to Obama. In the time of his presidency, the attacks on Obama intensified in terms of their racist content. And a lot of that was because the hard work of people like Alex, racist ideas were Trojan horses into criticisms of Obama and the demagogues would insist that they weren't racist at all. They just didn't like the policies of this President. While being flagrantly racist.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:13:43.000
    | text      = Yeah, when they combined politics and racism into one thing, it did not occur to them that later on they would continue to be the same thing. They thought they could take them away again, they could take them apart again, cocky, yeah.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:13:57.000
    | text      = And over time, these racist ideas were more mainstreamed to the point where it was completely acceptable for Trump to make a name for himself in politics by insisting Obama's birth certificate was fake. It was a normal thing for Alex to do stories about how we thought Michelle was a man and routinely called her Michel. People like Ted Nugent were heralded as legitimate people to take seriously when he did things like speculate that it would have been better if the South had won the Civil War, or when he said the black communities have a quote, mindless tendency toward violence. During the Obama presidency and the rise of the Tea Party, the right wing realized and exploited the political capital of using racism to rile up their base to hate the black president. So in those years, it probably did feel like there was a whole new racism thing going on. But it was the product of the right wing unleashing stuff that had been there for a long time. And the product of gradual normalization carried out by media figures exactly like Alex and Gavin. And quite literally Alex himself. Yeah, not people like Alex. Yeah, Nora. For example,

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:14:57.000
    | text      = it as they began this campaign of D Dealing with yay and Nick's winters, they should really take a moment to reflect on how fucking stupid it sounds to say that racism became a thing because of Obama, unless they're actually just trying to push Nazi shit in which case they just keep doing what they're doing. They're, they're killing it. Yeah. This brings me to the other point here. This is a, this is important to understand. Gavin is not trying to talk you out of being anti symmetric. He's engaging in exactly the same fool's errand that Alex was trying at the end of last week, he's going to try to convince EA to use different words and couches commented somewhat respectable and plausibly deniable language so they can get insanely rich together, while pushing hate. Yay is an incredible business opportunity for anyone who could manage to pull that off. But none of these people seem to realize that he's not interested in that at all. He and Nick understand that's what people like Alex and Gavin are doing. And they know they're not interested. So they're essentially just showing up for the free publicity and to spread their hate message to whatever audience they can get in front of. Yay, won't do this talk with Gavin where he's going to try and talk him off the ledge off camera, because the only reason to do it is to do it publicly. And because it has to be done publicly. Gavin has to use bullshit pretenses to approach the conversation. He can't just say Hey, be kind of anti semitic and we'll do a lot of business together. He has to pretend that he's trying to talk me out of anti semitism. If you watch this and you think Gavin has any sincere principled opposition to anti semitism?

It's the EAA believes on anti semitic conspiracy that anyone who questions the Jews gets killed by their amazing assassination teams. Maybe people aren't killed for being bigots, but big. It's a pretty consistently obsessed with how someone is going to kill them for speaking their false truths. A larger point is the EAA is once again engaging in Holocaust denial and getting no pushback from the people hosting him who are presumably there to talk him out of his anti semitism. The census that was taken in Germany in June 1933, but the Jewish population of Germany at approximately 505,000 people. This was when the Nazis took power. And in the intervening years, many Jewish people did flee. But no matter what number you cite for the Jewish population in Germany, it's important to remember that the Nazis were expansionist, and they held territory beyond one country's borders. Notably, the Nazis occupied Poland, where the population of Jews went from 3.3 million to approximately 380,000. After the war. It seems pretty clear here that yeh has gotten some pretty elementary basic Holocaust denial memes and talking points most likely from Nick. And now he's going to go on a campaign of repeating them as loudly as he can, whenever he's given a chance to talk. And folks like Gavin are hoping to get in on the scam.

This is directly in line with things that yay and Nick have said in the past. So I don't believe that this isn't a sincerely held view that anyone who doesn't believe in Jesus the same way that they do should have no place of influence in society. They're discussing yeas ideas and one of the first things he throws out is that he'd create a stratified society with a broad underclass of people who are ineligible to run businesses hold public office, or own malls. Presumably, the things that Yang is advocating for are abhorrent to any right thinking person who cares about the ideals of freedom, individuality and small government the way that folks like Gavin pretend to, it's the easiest thing to push back on too. And yet, Gavin doesn't really do so effectively. And I think that's probably because he wants the same thing, just maybe with a differently worded definition of who belongs in that marginalized underclass. In some sense, yeas refusal to relent on anything has the effect of revealing how little the people he's talking to really believe. They may be pretty loud about loving the Constitution when they're on their own, but they don't love it enough to fight with it. A really famous person suggesting the Jews shouldn't be allowed to work in government jobs. There are too many things that could go wrong, and he might walk out on Gavin, it's just episode one of his supposed series. And you don't want that. In that situation. It's best just to laugh at this suggestion. So you can pretend later that he didn't really mean it. And the joke's on me, Dan, the guy listening to this because I took it seriously.

Gavin had another show called free speech to different shows. Where and this one was very tried to book a liberal and conservative to chat and hash out their issues. Fun fact, one episode featured proud boy Rambo Joe Biggs as the conservative guest, who is now facing charges of seditious conspiracy regarding his involvement in January 6. Yeah, really cool, though, for Gavin to book one of the leaders of his street gang as a guest on his show, really given back, Nick is advocating for a theocratic society, which is antithetical to the Constitution and everything these right wing shitheads pretend to value.

    | timestamp = 01:02:01.000
    | text      = So I really do appreciate that. At the very least Gavin is doing a little soul searching and realizing that doing this interview was a stupid idea. Maybe not a stupid idea in terms of getting publicity. But if his goal really was to talk you out of being an anti Semite, and Gavin failed the test before he picked up a pen. And part of that is because he's just like every other shithead con man on the right, whose beliefs are completely malleable and can be swayed if they realize the profit margin is better with different beliefs. It seems like David didn't realize or didn't appreciate the EAA doesn't want to be tucked off any ledge and he's not on a ledge. He's acting like yay is an old friend who fell in with a bad crowd. And yeah, sure, yeah, he isn't with a bad crowd. But he's not an impressionable teen. He's not being tricked into being an anti Semite is a willing participant and antagonist in this whole operation. Through the course of this interview, Gavin has gone through the big transformation from part one of our episode into part two. At the beginning, he thought he could handle yay, like he handles all the other opportunistic shitheads that he deals with and get him to moderate his position so they can get rich together. This is almost like an escalation of attempts to moderate yea, Tim Poole is the most ineffectual loser in the right wing space. So that's a situation where there's not even really going to be meaningful pushback. If he does try to help you smooth out his positions, it'll be the softest touch imaginable, you might not even notice it. Then Alex is a little bit more coarse. He traffics in some of these same anti semitic ideas himself and he has a lot of experience whitewashing them for the larger audience. So he's naturally going to try and help gay into the box where they can make some money together. Then Gavin is the next level of offensive shithead. If Alex's version of acceptable anti semitism is too watered down for you, perhaps you'd like the version sold to you by the drunk guy who started a street gang that was involved in planning a seditious conspiracy involving January sixth. Gavin is a little more edgy than Alex. So his attempts to soften gays anti semitic shit are a little edgier. And they're still not even close to being effective because he doesn't want to be soften or have this message whitewashed. Yeah, he's saying what he wants to say. Yeah, yeah, he has now essentially done a speed run of all the right wing media from dopey to edgy, and rebuffed all of their attempts to make his positions more palatable. Nothing has been achieved for any side except for yay and Nick's, they got a ton of attention. And beyond that a second goal has not been achieved. Which leads us to the second element of this episode, which is where Crowder comes in a little more. The first use of this that is so effective for the right wing stuff is trying to convince him to soften these ideas. Yeah, it's what Alex did for three hours. It's what Tim Poole probably would have done in some ways if you'd been given a half a chance to play the game. Yeah, and it's what Gavin set out. That's the entire premise of saving. Yay.

Again, both my grandfather's almost died, both of them, World War Two, I almost didn't exist because of it. And they, they talked about what the Nazis were like, and my mom's dad also worked on some black budget weapons programs, the 50s and 60s, and just said that he'd been at some military bases that had Nazis on him that were very, very arrogant. And he didn't like having to work with them in these in these some of these programs. So I'm like eight years old here, my grandfather in Austin, Texas, sitting around the kitchen table bitching about, you know, Nazis and working on secret weapons programs and how arrogant they were and how much he hated the government bringing them in here. So that's a real thing that's going on. So my dislike of Nazis really comes from my grandfather's who both didn't like him very much.

That's that, you know, that's the real type ideology that the Nazis were striving for. And we know that Hitler, and of course, Joseph gurbles, wrote about how this is public. They wanted to take over England and kill HG Wells, and kill Bertrand Russell and others, because they HG Wells and Bertrand Russell had a competing authoritarian World Government leftist model.

    | text      = So just real quick, Alex is referring to Hitler's black book, which was a list of people he wanted rounded up and killed after the Nazis planned invasion of the UK in operations. de Lyon Alexandre is made up that they want to kill HG Wells and Bertrand Russell because they were setting up a rivaling world government. That is, for all intents and purposes Alex whitewashing Nazi history. Hitler wanted to kill wells because he ran an organization called poets essays to novelist International, which expelled the German branch of the group because they only accepted Aryan writers into their membership. He was a very vocal critic of the German government and was a very understandable target, especially considering the offense he'd made against Germany's place in the art and culture world. The reasoning was similar for Russell, he had been a non interventionist and he'd switched positions and decided that Hitler was a threat to all of Europe and needed to be fought. The list includes a bunch of folks like Virginia Woolf who they wanted to kill because she was married to a Jewish man and Aldous Huxley because he helped Jewish artists and writers flee from Germany. what Alex is saying is complete bullshit, and it's carrying water for Hitler. Now larger picture what Crowder is doing here is the second stage of the purpose gay serves to the right wing, as we discussed in sort of two parts of the episode, Crowder seems to have realized what so many have missed, which is that yeah, means this shit, he's not going to relent. And maybe people are right to call him anti semitic. He's getting ahead of the ball for a very important purpose, which is essentially to create an avatar of an anti Semite, so he can use them to excuse his own toxic opinions. Anytime he's accused of saying something fucked up or anti semitic, he can say I'm not yay, and that has the effect of giving him some breathing room. Alex knows this dynamic Well, since he was on the other side of it for most of his career and still is used that way from time to time. Most of Glenn Beck's conspiracy bullshit early career was predicated on him saying something insane and then saying I'm not Alex Jones and pretending that proves rationality even within the last year when he was being grilled about his promotion of great replacement conspiracies, Tucker, Carlson Shopback. This isn't some Alex Jones shit, yay, can fill a very important role for these right wing media figures, which is to be the person they are not which excuses their rhetoric, that person goes too far. And I'm not that person. Therefore, I've not gone too far. And what I'm saying is acceptable. And when you have someone like yeh, it provides a rare opportunity where there's this huge celebrity, so the media is eyes will be on what he's saying. And he's a bombastic personality. So he's not going to take this half way. This combination leads to the conversation going so far past the point of acceptability that it allows people like Crowder to move the ball a little bit down the field, and then it doesn't look like he's done anything. For instance, in response to you denying the Holocaust, Crowder can condemn that but then decry the problem of quote secular humanists with Jewish last names in Hollywood. That's pretty fucked up stuff. But when it's compared to what Yang is putting out there, it certainly doesn't seem that bad. Yeah. If yay, goes 50. I can go 30.

He'd been a communist before that in the Spanish Civil War, and been a hero and heavily wounded. But then when he actually got at the top of the British socialist society, and recognized that, that actually Stalin was being funded by the West, there was actually a war against the individual in the future, and that Hitler had been wound up by British intelligence, not not run by them, but actually built up and given power and funding early by the big banks. He realized that there was a global authoritarian system that operated under different names, but basically had the same goal, total power and control and reason I know that is not just reading it for probably eight. Well, that's clear, very clear, I think the essays in several big compendiums of George Orwell, right before he died in 1949. He finished 1984, late 1947. But he died about a year and a half later. And so George Orwell had this view of it as well. He thought the Nazis were the ultimate evil. He fought them before World War Two in Spain, and against Franco. And then he later learned there was a more evil group of Fabian socialist British intelligence, basically Spectre, what you see in the James Bond movies, I'm sorry, James Bond is Spectre. And I'm not saying all British intelligence, but that British Empire model that virtual America at Bretton Woods, and then America became the world empire at that point, that system is full spectrum dominance, where they want to control all the major groups, and then play them off against each other in an alien dialectic.

He constantly makes excuses for raving bigots and anti Semites and gives his audience flimsy arguments for why you shouldn't see them as raving bigots and anti Semites, which they actually are. And anyone who says that those people are anti Semites are actually just mad that they're these people like freedom too much, Alex as consistently He hosted outright anti Semites and Holocaust deniers on his show and he never has had a problem funneling his audience into their information spaces, so long as they keep their shit subtle on air. The list of people from recent times is pretty long, but it goes as far back as he's been on air. In recent 2003 episode that we did, we saw I'm interviewing Eric Schmidt, the Holocaust denying techno DJ and that wasn't an isolated incident. Flash forward to the present day. He's having softball pretend debates with David Duke and Richard Spencer, and hosting friendly conversations with a man who has inspired a lot of Nick and yeas current ideology, ie Michael Jones. If anyone facilitated the slide further down the path toward anti semitism. It's been Alex with all of his non existent standards for guest Selection and Show prep. Even so framing this whole thing as a reaction is unacceptable. Yeah, you and Nick are anti Semites they've decided to be so because they believe bullshit. Alex is trying to take moral responsibility away from their decision by saying that it's the left's evil, manipulative actions that led them to becoming Nazis out of spite, I guess, I guess it's spite. The implication here is that the left if the left weren't doing the things that they were doing, Nick and EA wouldn't be anti Semites, which isn't true. Nick has been this way for a long time. And Alex was fully aware of that the whole time he's known him. He's just not able to plausibly deny who Nick is anymore. So he needs to come up with a new spin. And it's pretty fucking weak.

So you can see what Alex is actually saying here. Less leftist academics and Hollywood people, many of them Jewish are teaching non white people that all white people except Jews are inherently evil. Seeing this kind of thing will make Nazis look legitimate. So the left is driving people toward becoming Nazis. That's fascinating because I pretty much agree with Alex's construction, except for one part, academics in the media and Hollywood aren't saying that white people are inherently evil there is that that's a paranoid white identity fantasy that Alex uses for a bunch of different narrative shortcuts, but it's one that's just accepted as truth on his show. It does make some sense that believing Alex's version of the world would make Nazis not look that bad. So in essence, if you believe the pipeline that Alex is describing, then he's actually responsible for the creation of a ton of Nazis. He presents people with a false reality that makes the Nazis look less extreme than they actually are. Thereby making them a more acceptable group to associate with or ally with, How bad are the Nazis compared to the globalists who work for the literal devil and want to kill all humans?

And to say all that when we were in Austin, but then he comes a week later and cries about it to Crowder and says, manway, I'm a victim of a publicity stunt. They're these terrible Nazis. I'm just a humble water filter. You know, no, Tropix Patriot salesman, please, please don't cancel me. And you know, the thing is, like, there's layers to it. Of course, Alex has canceled, but he also presumably has Zionist backers like no doubt. I think even told me that was the first time I ever went on his show he cut in during the commercial break, because the first thing I talked about was Israel. And he cut in during the commercial break and said, like, Hey, I'm not telling you what to say. You can say whatever you want. But I would recommend like not talking about Israel, so much like the Jew thing or whatever he goes, but that's just not gonna get you anywhere.
