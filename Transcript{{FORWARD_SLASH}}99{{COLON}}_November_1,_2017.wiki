There's some big news in the world of Alex, which I think is going to excite everybody. And beyond that there. I have to put Media Matters on blast. They will be joining Will Smith and the ad company behind the Ninja Turtles in New York caramel company. I appreciate what Media Matters is doing and bringing attention to stuff, but they've made a critical error. And I will discuss it a little bit later in the episode.

But it is. Quite frankly, I love it. I can't wait to I can bring all this stuff out very soon, but they figure it out. We've got PI's and people really freaked out. So I'm not telling you anything.

Another thing I want to bring into focus is today while I was on the bus, going to and from therapy, right, I noticed a bunch of Ninja Turtles. Well, I noticed that as well. But I noticed on Twitter, a lot of people complaining about Laura Loomer. Laura Loomer, got on Twitter and she said Can someone start an Uber or Lyft that doesn't use Muslim drivers. I don't want to I don't want to give money to Muslim immigrants, something along those lines. And everyone got surprised. I'm like, Guys, yeah, I'm we've we've been over this. You know, like, everyone's getting hundreds of retweets for being like Laura Loomer sucks and like, we could have told you that six months ago, that's when she went on Alex's show and said that there are no ratter there are no rational Muslims. There's no moderate Muslims, when she went on the show and said that everyone one's in denial about the idea that we're at war with that religion. We already fucking knew that she's come out and said way worse. Everyone's acting like oh, what a surprise. It's fucking garbage. Get up to speed you assholes. Not you people listening.

And some places can implement some plan. Some places can implement other, and we can see what works. That's the idea of government. I get, I guess, governments and stuff like that. There is something to that. Now, if you want to dismantle the entire federal government in the name of states, right, you're stupid that we can't do. But the idea of like, the idea that people pitch in terms of states rights, about like, let's see how things work in Colorado, and then maybe if that works there, if we can expand it, like that is kind of what happened with marijuana legalization. Yeah, they had the right to do that. And we learned it fucking worked super well. And so other states adopt it. Yeah, that is the kind of thing that I understand where that philosophy comes from.

And I absolutely think that the one is one of the Terry's a certain progressive, that can go, you know, we're not Pollyanna, there is a rational approach to take. But at the same time, trickle down economics is magical. It doesn't exist. So that conservative, polite disagreement is gone. There is no further discussion of tax breaks for the rich, leading to economic growth. We're done there. So that's not a polite disagreement. Well, that's a disagree as you're making it reality.
