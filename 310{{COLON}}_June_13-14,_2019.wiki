Today, Dan and Jordan discuss a couple of incredibly messed up days on [[the Alex Jones Show]]. Most of the coverage is about Alex's insanely convoluted coverage of the tanker incident in the Gulf of Oman, and about a recent cyber attack that has targeted InfoWars. Along the way, though, the gents learn how leftist brainwashing on college campuses works, and that one of Alex's lawyers may not be totally insane.
