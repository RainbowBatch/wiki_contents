Dan and Jordan are still stuck back in the past, discussing episodes of The Alex Jones Show from 2008, and Dan has reached a strange point of conflict. Despite him being wrong all the time, was Alex Jones so bad back in 2008? Would Alex Jones be way happier if he had never started selling weird pills and making tons of money?  These questions and more are discussed on this episode.
