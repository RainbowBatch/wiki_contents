'''Steve Kirsch''' is a multimillionaire and former entrepreneur<ref name=":0">https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/05/1036408/silicon-valley-millionaire-steve-kirsch-covid-vaccine-misinformation/</ref>. He went off the deep end during the pandemic and now spends his time making crappy anti-vax posts on Substack. He is an occasional guest on [[InfoWars]], with his first appearance apparently on November 9 2021<ref name=":1">[[616: November 9, 2021]]</ref>.

In March 2020, he founded the Covid-19 Early Treatment Fund (CETF), which looked for FDA-approved drugs with a well-known safety profile which were effective against Covid-19<ref name=":0" />. While this was a good idea in theory, he was extremely overoptimistic about the results for several drugs, claiming enormous benefits for hydroxychloroquine and fluvoxamine. His frustration with experts (including those he'd funded) grew to the point that most avoided him.

In May 2021, he branched off into antivax activism<ref>https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/my-bio</ref>. In the same month, the entire scientific advisory board of CETF resigned due to his behavior, and he was asked to resign from his most recent startup later that year<ref name=":0" />.

A speculative explanation for his actions is a drive to heroically save millions, which is sabotaged by its narcissistic nature. Before the pandemic he funded asteroid detection efforts<ref name=":0" />. In a pandemic, he started a high-risk philanthropic effort to find effective treatments. (Both were good ideas.) He could not accept that the latter had little to no results. This would mean he didn't save many. He decided the naysayers were dumb, and he had to convince them. Authorities eventually promoted vaccines while still ignoring his treatments. It was unacceptable for his efforts to be ignored for a comparable alternative. This would still be failure. If the alternative was inferior, he'd still have the best treatments. If the vaccines were worse than nothing, he'd have the only treatments. In fact, if the vaccines are lethal enough, he can save millions merely by spreading the truth about them.

Unlike many Covid-19 cranks, he does not agree that the virus is fake or low-lethality<ref name=":2">https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/1m-bet-rules</ref> (which would make his early treatment efforts pointless). As of November 2021, he did not think that vaccines were intended to cause deaths<ref name=":1" />. Instead, his narrative is that the vaccines cause enormous hidden harms that exceed their benefits (if any).

Kirsch has a dishonest and erratic rhetorical style. A common rhetorical theme is bets or bounties for "proofs", and announcing that the lack of takers proves him right. This assumes that someone with both money and expertise has heard of him and expects him to pay out without onerous shenanigans. Hidden in the fine print are conditions that likely bias the outcome or render the proof impossible. For example, "bets" often require neutral judges, preferably with a scientific background<ref name=":2" />. For extreme assertions, a neutral-yet-informed person may necessarily be a poor reasoner. In another example, he once offered<ref>https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire

</ref> a million dollars to anyone affiliated with a university who could prove vaccine deaths were below a certain value. Behind the headline, he mandated that they must use the methodology from a blog post, and publish the results in a peer-reviewed journal. No money was offered to demonstrate that most peer-reviewed journals would reject a paper using the method, or to publish a paper showing that the method was horseshit. No mention was made of the effect of an author's enormous financial interest on a journal's willingness to publish.

Steve Kirsch is a fan of live debates and often structures his bets around them. Any person wishing to debate him, with or without money, should observe what happened to lab leak proponent Yuri Deigin. Yuri accepted an offer to debate him live on vaccine safety (with no apparent money on it). They did not discuss having anyone else in their debate, which was supposed to be less than 2 hours. Since it wasn't explicitly forbidden, Kirsch invited a dozen or so of his closest friends and conspiracy theorists to constantly interrupt Deigin and make contradictory assertions <ref>https://youtu.be/SUmicxBfWuo?t=581</ref>. One can assume he'd pull even more absurd shenanigans if there was a seven-digit sum on the line.
