'''Daniel 'Dan' Bidondi''' is a former Pro-wrestler and former [[InfoWars]] reporter who is particularly notable for his involvement in the coverage of [[Sandy Hook]] and the [[Boston Marathon Bombing]].

[[Alex Jones|Alex]] has implied (and available public evidence corroborates) that he would send Bidondi into tense situations like the aftermath of disasters, where Bidondi would generally make a fool of himself by disrupting any official proceeding he could. Depending on how responsible adults responded to the disruption, Alex could spin the footage various ways.

For example, when Bidondi disrupted a press conference related to the Marathon Bombings, Alex claimed the unwillingness to answer Bidondi's incoherent questions represented evidence of a cover up or narrative.

After repeatedly traveling to Sandy Hook and harnessing the families of victims, InfoWars tried to pretend that they never really knew Bidondi anyways, recently referring to him as a "[former] contractor" (brackets in the original) and claiming that Alex had no control over his actions or assignments. This is undercut by audio of Alex jokingly explaining that he referred to Bidondi as the "Kraken" and comparing sending him to events as being akin to "Releas[ing] the Kraken".

Nowadays Bidondi hosts his own podcast where he appears to discuss some pretty crazy conspiracies, including stuff that probably belongs on [[Project Camelot]].
