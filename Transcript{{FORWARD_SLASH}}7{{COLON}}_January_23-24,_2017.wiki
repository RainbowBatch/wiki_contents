I was looking all over the place, and I couldn't find any of them that didn't look like they were half dead, young, old, you name it now.

Jordan is on his workstation out there in London, good ol jolly England. And luckily for us, Jordan sent in a little report from from London, what are you seeing on the ground? And so for you know, we have a fight for knowledge, your knowledge fight. Okay. And so we're gonna get a little bit of knowledge from across the pond. All right.

I'm speaking specifically of Nazis, the ones from Germany, not the ones from the United States who currently hold power over over all of us really. It's strange being here and And, you know, I don't feel blamed for Trump. So much as I feel like the representation of Trump, you know what I'm saying? Like, I think they hate Trump so much here because his hair offends them personally. It reminds them too much of their own. Or his fake tan, his fake tan reminds them of the sun. And they have the same relationship with the sun that I have with, like, an old high school classmate, where it's like, no, I know you. I just, I just don't want to see you again, except for short bursts. I think I think one of their big issues is they do feel like, you know, we, we want up to them. Like we have a little bit of a little brother syndrome. With the UK, no matter how much things change. There is still that kind of small relationship there where, you know, with one vote, they said, Hey, we can destroy great pet Britain. And we said, oh, yeah, you like that? Well, with one vote, we can destroy the world. How do you feel about that? Assholes? So that's America. I can I can, you know, they, they read the news here. And the news is about Trump. Even though, you know, they had something very important to happen with the Supreme Court ruling on Brexit. And the Supreme Courts of Britain, which I don't know if they even have real courts, they're everybody wore wigs. They ruled that you cannot actually trigger Article 50. That's the Brexit law, without a congressional or parliamentary, which is their word. Like, you know, the C word. You can use parliamentary rules to actually vote on Article 50. And you can't do it without a parliamentary vote. So you think, you know, if everybody is finally realized that they don't want Brexit to happen, then they could put pressure on their parliament to keep that from happening. But that's a very non British way of looking at things. The fact that the majority of people now don't want Brexit to happen, and it doesn't matter to them. What matters to them is that they do it the right way. It's that kind of bloody mindedness that just is so British. Yeah, we don't want this to happen. And we have an opportunity to keep it from happening. What was that? How about and that's the end of that sentence.
