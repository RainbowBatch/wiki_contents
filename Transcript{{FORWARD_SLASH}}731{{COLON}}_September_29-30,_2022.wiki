Now, if you think that idiocy to not be top, Kamala Harris, who is not geriatric, who does not have the later onset of dementia, but it's just a complete empty suit puppet has come out and said that the United States shares a very important relationship with an alliance with the Republic of North Korea.

Now, I wouldn't be too surprised to if like people were curious, he was gonna continue kidnapping immigrants and stranding them in various parts of the country to own the libs durling the storm, or if he would wait until it had passed to do another publicity stunt that mocks human rights. Also, it's fun and all to point out that Harris misspoke in a speech and I'm glad Alex can have fun pretending it was a sincere statement. I would just like to remind everyone how pumped Alex was when Trump went to North Korea and palled around with Kim Jong-un. Alex didn't seem to have a problem with Trump when he said this about Kim Jong-un at a rally in 2018. Quote, we went back and forth then we fell in love.

Now, with the Nord Stream one and Nord Stream two pipelines, both confirmed to be attack in western controlled sectors, the Russian government officially saying that NATO in the United States blew up the pipelines. And I even had Russophobic on Joel Skousen is a smart guy, but he's definitely anti Russian, anti communist Russia and anti Putin Russian. He agrees the analysis is clear that Biden in the New World Order blew up both pipelines, and looks like Nord Stream two, they're saying can ever be repaired. What that will do economically to Europe will be beyond devastating. It will be felt here in a big way.

So I really don't see how this is a meaningful statement from Alex, or from Skousen. It's exactly what you would expect. Yeah. Now, the situation with the pipelines is an interesting one. And it's something to keep an eye on, but it will be unwise to fully jump to a conclusion about it immediately, which is what Alex and Skousen have clearly done. And always do. There were three leaks, which were clearly not the product of an accident or a coincidence, the odds of three independent incidents happening around the same time are astronomical. So it's just, you know, it's not just Russia, that saying that probably isn't intentional act. Right. US and NATO are also saying that

    | text      = clear that this was done by someone for some reason. But it's not really clear right now, who it was or why most people think it was Russia for a number of reasons. The first is that they have the capability and capacity to do it from a technological standpoint. The second is that they would lose essentially nothing given that their oil companies are sanctioned. And these pipelines are all but shut down currently. The third is that this kind of gesture would send a strong message to the whole of Europe that they're not going to be getting Russia oil in the future. And that even if the war ends, they're at the mercy of Russia's energy supplies. This is in line with acts that Russia has carried out in the past using energy as a tool to apply pressure on Europe to sway policy. In the immediate this isn't going to make things that much worse at all. For Europe, in terms of energy supplies, Nord Stream two was never open. So it doesn't really factor into things. And Russia cut off Nord Stream one over the course of the war in Ukraine. This is more of an omen than anything else. And there are very few parties, you could imagine having a reason to do this, other than Russia, right? It is possible that this is the result of a wild coincidence, or even a rogue actor that we haven't identified could be behind it. But the smart money is pretty clear.

But Russia does have some potential reasons to carry this out. And now if you're addicted to false flags, you've found a reason for the US or NATO to do it. They have no reason to do it, but Russia does. And now they have a reason, which is to frame Russia, right. This is tortured reasoning, and it's based on Alex and Skousen has intense hatred of our government because they think it's controlled by evil communist globalists.

It's just a write up about a report released by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization that looked at edible insects around the world and what potential existed from exploring insect agriculture. It wasn't about feeding kids bugs. A large portion of it is about raising bugs to use as feed for livestock. But Alex doesn't know any of this because he just has a headline from about a decade ago and he's using it to make shit up to freak out his audience. Yeah. The headline about UK schoolchildren is from a May 2022 article on Breitbart that misreports on a study that researchers were carrying out to see if primary school children would change their opinions on alternative proteins. If they were given accurate information about them. No one's being forced to eat bugs in their school lunch here.

Yeah, you can hear how Alex is reporting this story, which is how the article wants the reader to experience it. In the real world. What's happened is that there's a brand of chips and snacks called circle harvest, and they use cricket protein in their chips. It's very prominently displayed on the packaging with the name of the product being cricket corn chips, so I don't know if anybody's being tricked into anything here. Circle harvest has been holding presentations at schools since 2007 about their insect protein business and their insect farming, which weirdly is only now becoming an issue for Alex and all these other idiots on the right. This year they began selling their corn chips as an option in about 1000 Australian schools at the canteen. So if kids want to eat them, they can. They don't have to. It's just a product that can choose to buy or not like Doritos or Cheetos. Right kind of feels to me like Alex is afraid of losing to bugs on the free market.

It's the formaldehyde cream that's being used to treat human keratin like a person's hair. Yeah, there's been a lot of misinformation flying around about chitin. The polysaccharide found in bug exoskeletons mostly about how it's undigestible by humans and toxic, it's not toxic. But it is true that chitin itself may not be fully digestible. But so cellulose, which doesn't stop people from eating celery, you can still get nutritional value out of eating something that contains parts that can't be fully digested, and then you just pass those parts.

The actual study that's behind this is titled quote associations of BMI with COVID 19 vaccine uptake vaccine effectiveness and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes after vaccination in England, a population based cohort study, if you understand the title, you'll probably realize that this study would never be able to be used to make the kind of claims Alex's reporting, it's just not something that you're looking at lead stories reached out to the study's co author, and they explained that this interpretation of their data is irresponsible and incorrect. There's one data box in the study that's being used to argue that vaccines cause a 44% increased risk of infection. And if you only look at the numbers in isolation and create your own interpretation, you could maybe come away with that conclusion. But it's totally out of context and wrong. This was an observational study, which is to say it depends entirely on tests that have already been taken. As explained by lead stories, quote, their data was dependent on COVID tests that were available to them and the people who chose to take them. In other words, a person who didn't feel sick and didn't take a test wouldn't be able to provide with them with a negative test result. So the data is highly skewed. Yeah, that is an issue. As we see, every day, Alex has a new COVID vaccine narrative that's full of shit and easily dismissed with a tiny bit of digging.

It's a joint venture operated by the Danish company Energinet and the Polish oil company Gaz-System. The pipeline has been in the works since 2001, with long periods of dormancy, but it's always been an attempt to decrease Europe's dependence on Russian oil. As far back as the beginning of the year, they were estimating October 1 as their partial opening date with the full capacity possible by the beginning of 2023. Right. It's maybe interesting that this pipeline opened around the same time as those other ones were possibly sabotaged. But that alone is not enough to prove that these events are connected. Yeah.

We go through and we're entering the bottom of one of the most deadly cycles in human history, if not the most deadly with the high tech weapons and systems that are on The surface of this planet, beneath the seas and in the air and space, what. But when I really get focused, I find a place of clarity and understanding and can really articulate why the enemy's doing, what they're doing and what we have to do to stop them. And so right now, and one of those focus places, we'll see if I can stay there and just calmly go over this because the gravity of all of this is so unbelievably important.

    | text      = So this isn't true. A member of the greens parliamentary group recently said quote by the end of 2026, a third of all newly advertised positions in the city should be filled by applicants with a migration background. This is a headline that Alex is reading from summit dot news. Paul Joseph Watson sight and just on its face, the way this is being reported is convoluted. Here's how the article starts, quote, In the name of promoting diversity ruling greens in the German in the German city of Hanover plan to ban a third of native citizens from applying for government jobs so they can be given to migrants. Yes, really? Wow. How is a third of city jobs ideally being filled by non German born citizens the equivalent of banning a third of native citizens from applying for those jobs. That's just nonsense. Unless Paul somehow believes that the only jobs available in Hanover are from the city. Paul reports it this way because it's a much more flashy headline then city aims for 30% immigrant workforce. Paul's version is easier for Alex to yell about and get his audience nice and scared with. That's why he writes the completely nonsensical and dishonest title that he does. It's because Paul's role is to churn out rage bait, the demagogues like Alex can then use to incite their audiences. Here's the part of the story that Paul doesn't want to bring up and neither does Alex Hanover's population is only 78%, German born aiming for a city workforce of approximately 30%, non German born individuals is really not too far off from accurately reflecting the city's demographic makeup. Considering that the 30% that they're talking about is a goal, not a mandate, it's likely that they'll fall short of that number. And maybe, maybe they'll hit 22% immigrant hires, which would be exactly representational of the city as a whole. Yeah, this is outrage based on nothing. And it's actually based on less than nothing. It's based on a willful ignorance of basic reality, because that reality would get in the way of being able to agitate against groups of people you don't like, and you want your audience not to, like, pure and simple.

Even if it were classified what he was doing, there's still ways he could corroborate that deployment, which he has failed to do. Also, it turns out he was dishonest about why he couldn't reenlist after his first stretch in the Air Force. He apparently was stationed at a base in Okinawa and got popped for drunk driving mere days before 9/11 Which led to him being demoted from Airman First Class to basic airman.
