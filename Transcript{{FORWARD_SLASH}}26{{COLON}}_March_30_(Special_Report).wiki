Of course, he gets Roger Stone in and they have an interview. That's bad. Roger Stone leaves it about 50 minutes in and Alex loses his shit. So we're not gonna talk much about the Roger Stone portion of the show. Because quite honestly, it's just the two of them doing like a wrestling shoot promo about like, come at me bitch. Right, right. Like Roger Stone is trying to flex on the House Intelligence Committee real hard. He calls them pussies, stuff like that. Which leads us to right around the 17 minute mark. Alex Jones says this is probably my favorite clip we've ever played on this show. I don't know how anything is gonna top it. I've listened to this conservative estimate 40 times.

On the amazing game changing nutraceuticals and supplements we have Mike Rogers, I'm gonna go back to you just a moment. Let me just point out folks. It was four years ago that we're putting out iodine supplements that you now see in stores everywhere. Because ionized the good halogen fluoride and bromine and bromide are the bad ones there and everything. And because we had people basically doing industrial sabotage the block is the DEA controls iodine because it can be used to make a bunch of stuff, you name it nearby, nearby sea breaking bands, which he used to make everything. The point is though it's a legal element, you can have it okay, and the way we put it in palm oil, it's not used for anything illegal, but to get the crystals from deep earth mining. That's something that only drug companies the Pentagon has also used strangely enough and nerve gas but whatever.

Strangely enough, I was at Trump Tower in a penthouse with one of the heirs of a major restaurant chain that had been out on their big yacht drove around New York the day after 911 at a memorial. And I said they were talking about art displays where people would pay $50 million for a skull was was was some rhinestones on it, that somebody would leprosy jacked off on, you know, stuff like that. And I was like, why would you spend $50 million on something so ugly and pathetic and that guy looked at me, he goes, you don't get it. Alex, do you? That's religious. The fact that that $20 million could feed hundreds of 1000s of African starving children. And the fact that they gave it to some weird degenerate artist for a skull with rhinestones I've heard diamonds, a skull may be worth $500. And then they metaphorically gave their seed to death not to a woman to create life. It was worshiping death. It was a death offering a death cult offering have 50 of those $54 million, the newspaper to a Shimon covered skull. And then you understand everything. Oh my god, oh yeah, they go and they pay millions a week for art. And they go back to their pet houses, and they burn it. He was one of the burn and I go because that was money for poor people. Exactly. It's like it's as good as killing a kid killing innocence.

    | text      = It's a little bit of a bummer, because it is excessive in some ways. It costs 14 million pounds for him to make. Because of all times and platinum. Oh, yeah. And that way. And the job. I thought it was because of the labor the joke of Alex's like, they paid $54 million for a semen covered skull. He couldn't sell it. No, no. Why? Why would you? Yeah, he ended up having to buy it along with a consortium. So he put together a collection of people who bought it, in order for him to get his cost back. So at the end of the day, Damien Hirst ended up essentially breaking even for this piece of art that he made, right. But the interesting thing about this, there's two things that I think are really interesting, and I'm not into art, so I don't know, a whole lot. But when I was looking into it, one of the things was the commentary that people had, like critics have, which is the modern art genre really is publicity, right? publicity and marketing is really one of the most modern art forms. Yes. And so the idea that he was able to use publicity and get people to talk about this thing that he made is really what is more impressive, right? The idea that a lot of people don't know if he has sold it, or who bought it. It gives intrigue and so like, that's one of the things that the art world is really interested in. Right. The second thing is that the art, the for the love of God is considered in the genre of a memento mori Ranch is an art piece that is designed to remind you of your mortality, right? So essentially one of the reviews of it that art historian Rudy fuge observed is The skull is out of this world celestial almost. It proclaims victory over death. At the same time it represents death is something in infinitely more relentless compared to the tearful sadness of Vanitas seen the diamond skull is glory itself. Luck you I know but that's art people talk man. Yeah. So the the idea of it though is kind of interesting in that you have a skull, which is kind of the symbol of death. And then you have attached to it. Platinum and 1000s of real diamond right? And it is sort of it does take the piss out of materialism and money in some ways. It is supposed to have some commentary. Now whether it's successful or not, is another story. I have no idea. I'm not an art critic. Right, but it's not some stupid piece. It is there was a point that he was trying to make. And he is a legitimate artist. He is someone who has put out tons of work.

And as he's gotten into in the last week or so, there weren't it wasn't on this episode, but we will eventually address it. He has been starting to spout some revisionist history about the Holocaust. That makes me super uncomfortable and a lot of ideas about these globalists set up Hitler like kind of things like they propped him up and they were making him do the things
