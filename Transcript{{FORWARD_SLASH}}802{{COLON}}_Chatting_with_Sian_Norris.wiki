    | text      = I swear to you, I wear the same clothes every day. The only expression I have now is just socks. That's it. Ironic socks is my my bright spot. So, Shawn, I wanted to start by giving people a little bit of background on you. You I if I understand correctly, you started more as a fiction writer short fiction and the like and then became a human rights journalist traveling around the world kicking ass? How did that transition work?

    | timestamp = 00:03:02.000
    | text      = So I mean, I like to think of myself as a fiction and short fiction writer. But to be honest, I didn't have that much fiction published. I had a few short stories published. And as many journalists and writers are I'm constantly trying to finish that novel that will become a huge blockbuster hits one day. Sure, sure. I think I was always really interested in writing and telling stories. And I really wanted to do that, like in whatever form it took. And I think, you know, alongside my sort of background, writing fiction, was also this background in feminist activism and human rights activism, particularly on women's rights, abortion rights, obviously, and LGBTQ plus people's rights. And so that really kind of led me to sort of bring those two skills and passions together. How do I talk about the issues facing women and marginalized people? And how can I use my skills as a writer that leads you to human rights journalism. And so for the past couple of years, I've been a staff writer on a independent paper in the UK, but recently gone back to freelancing, which is definitely my happier place so much more. I much prefer freelancing and having that extra bit of freedom. And yeah, and it's just sort of, yeah, like reported on human rights and women's issues from Bangladesh, from Kenya, from Romania, from the US looking from the UK, if that makes sense, haven't actually been on the ground in the US. And obviously,

So yeah, so one of the interesting things that I noticed on that front is that with your short fiction, it is far more rhythmic. In terms of your structure, your sentencing all of those things. Whereas when I read this book, it is I don't know I would almost describe it as a hammer. You know, This Yeah, darts and it keeps driving the point, the point the boat, you know, like that kind of thing. Why do you feel like there's a deliberate choice to? I mean, obviously, there's a deliberate choice between the two. But do you feel more comfortable in one or the other?

    | timestamp = 00:05:17.000
    | text      = I don't know, if it's necessarily feeling more comfortable. It's just that they require really different styles. So I think when I what I wanted to achieve with with this book was a couple of things in terms of form and structure in it one to like, get across the urgency. I mean, obviously, we're in a slightly different place now because of the overruling of Roe and the success of the Dobbs case in the US. But when I was started writing this book, a lot of people didn't really take it very seriously. When I was saying, you know, this is a real threat to abortion rights, this right to abortion rights is coming from white supremacy and white male supremacy in particular. So I was very much like, I have to get this across, I have to really be urgent, I have to really, as you say, How am I home? What is going on and why this is an issue. And I wanted to be really, really clear. And make make my points really clear. And particularly said it wasn't just speaking to someone like not speaking to myself, like, Oh, I know these issues, because I've been buried in them and researching them and reporting on them for a really long time. So how do I really open it up and make sure that someone not as engaged although I think people who read the book are gonna be somewhat engaged in women's rights issues, just because unless they're in So Steven Seagal and I pick it up by

    | text      = There's obviously when you're writing fiction, you can be a lot more playful. And you can play around with language and, and shapes of sentences. And I think that's one of the things I really enjoy about writing fiction, although I haven't done any for a while, like I keep saying, as I say, gonna finish that novel.

    | text      = Right? Well, I mean, last, the last interview I did was with Jeff Charlotte, and his book was written, I mean, obviously, it's different because it's written from a man. And it's talking about very, very similar issues, from a different lens. And from his creative writing background, you know, or creative nonfiction background, you can definitely see how he's trying to craft the stories within the story, in order to kind of do a little. I mean, I'm not, not politically here, but it's an entertaining book, and that way, and then, like I said, from, from your point of view, from your perspective here, this is not entertainment. This is a fucking emergency, you know, we got to start riots is is the way that I felt from that,

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:07:52.000
    | text      = I think is that as points in the book, where I do try and kind of create a paint a picture of what was going on, for example, there's a section on the January the sixth insurrection, and I try and like get go into like, what it was like what it looked like, from watching it on the news in the UK, that but at the same time, I wrote most of the book during the pandemic. And in the lockdowns, which meant, there wasn't a lot of opportunity to go anywhere. There was a point when I went to North Bristol, and I was like, wow, it's like, the furthest I've been from my house for four months. So I think that was that kind of, you know, there was a potential to sort of, in another time to have gone to different places and described what I was seeing and kind of embedded myself more in in communities and, and movements, but because to the restrictions of the pandemic, it just wasn't a possibility.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:08:41.000
    | text      = I think that even from that perspective, and that's what I want to get into next about the book is you start off by kind of listing out the main characters. Because when we are talking about so our show, I know you have no idea who we are, which is fine. We cover Alex Jones of info, yeah, exclusively for way too long. And our character lens is going to be through that. You know, and you were talking more about a global, I don't want to say conspiracy, but a grouping of different people who are interested in restricting women's rights in different places around the globe. So I wanted to I wanted to give you an opportunity to kind of give some of those Greatest Hits. As far as Kenya, the the organization's there. I mean, the I wanted to hear more about the Dutch. What was it? Let me take check Miami Asante. Yeah, yeah, I wanted to definitely hear more about that. So could you could you kind of do that for us real quick?

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:09:54.000
    | text      = Yeah, sure. So, the sort of, I mean, if I go back a couple of steps, the way that I looked at this research and the way I wanted to structure the book was to show that there is a pipeline between extremist anti abortion ideas that kind of fester and ferment in you know, very dark spaces, you know, far right neo Nazi groups and extremist anti abortion groups. So in the UK perspective, I mentioned organizations like patriotic alternative, which is a far right group based here, and a center for bioethical Research UK, which is a branch of a US organization. And it's a very small group, but it's very extreme anti abortion group in the UK. That's one

    | timestamp = 00:10:46.000
    | text      = Yeah, they've got such a benign name. And yeah, their actions are really, really extreme. And, you know, they become very well known for like displaying very unpleasant and graphic abortion imagery, outside MPs, constituency offices, and also outside clinics and things like that. And then I kind of look at the sort of more mainstream organizations, which I kind of think of as the next stage in this pipeline. So you get this sort of extremist ideology. And then it's laundered by more mainstream groups who, you know, can go to the UN who go to the European Courts of Human Rights, who take amicus briefs to the Supreme Court in the US. So these are people like Citizen NGO, which is a Spanish organization, Alliance Defending Freedom, which I'm sure you as listeners will be really familiar with that very influential and very influential on the whole road debate. And then from there, these organizations kind of take the extreme anti abortion ideology, clean it up, put it in a PowerPoint presentation, which to share while wearing a seat. And it goes into politicians. And the politicians then kind of enact a lot of these policies, in terms of restricting abortion rights, or pushing really anti immigration policies and saying that the way to resolve things like demographic winters, or so called demographic crisis, is to restrict women's reproductive freedoms. So that's when we look at places like Hungary in Europe, Poland, obviously, which has a very strict anti abortion ban, and also issues in the UK as well. So yeah, so I guess like some of the organizations that are really focused on you mentioned in Kenya, I've done a lot of work on this organization called Citizen go, which, as I said, is a Spanish grip. And they're sort of modus operandi is to get people to sign petitions, which focus on a whole range of sort of anti gender initiatives. I mean, it's a really random selection, everything from, you know, Roe versus Wade to a Netflix show that's got a gay character in it,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:12:45.000
    | text      = right? Well, that's why we talk about with them is, why the fuck are they there? Who fucking cares? What is a Spanish organization doing? I mean, essentially, once again, colonizing Kenya, this idea of structure?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:13:01.000
    | text      = Well, this is yeah, this is where I got really angry. Because one of the sort of things that citizen NGO has done in Kenya is it's got a representative in Kenya, she's a Kenyan woman. And, you know, she's addressed the United Nations about abortion rights in the country, and LGBT rights. And they argue that abortion and LGBTQ plus people's rights are like a Western imposition on traditional Kenyan values and traditional African values. And of course, this completely ignores the fact that citizen NGO, is a Spanish European organization imposing its ideology, and its motivations on Kenya. And when I was in Kenya last year, you know, I was talking to a gynecologist who's quite high up in the sort of medical profession over there. And he was saying, we've always had abortion in Kenya, abortion is traditional in Kenya. So the idea that these global North organizations can go into the global South, and try and spread their ideology and spread their ideas, and then claim somehow that they're, you know, presenting to African values is really offensive. And it's offensive to the amazing, you know, pro abortion activists who are working really hard in Kenya and in other parts of Sub Saharan Africa. And of course, it doesn't go also very active in Latin America. And the kind of very close to the Spanish far right party Vox as well.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:14:55.000
    | text      = Absolutely. And I think in terms of particularly we're seeing a massive backlash against LGBT rights in East Africa at the moment. And you know, a lot of the laws that we see against LGBT people are really rooted in those colonialist era laws from, you know, the 1800s. And when Britain was going stomping around the place telling everyone had to live their lives and how to behave, and we don't seem to have stopped doing that.

And I'm saying no, maybe I'm on the wrong side of history here. That is entirely possible. I do want to, I do want to throw in something that is very almost kind of insidious, here is that a lot of religious organizations that you talk about in the book, present themselves in the United States and in the UK as one thing, and then when you see their behavior in other countries? It is I mean, disgusting. So can you like as as I was saying, like the Dutch Reformed Church, was it?

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 00:16:51.000
    | text      = It does help. And I mean, he was education secretary at a time when anyone could see the administration was really going after so called woke curry in schools, from, you know, a backlash against positive representations of LGBT people, a backlash against, you know, any materials that talk about black history, talk about the enslavement of people in America and African American people. And obviously, she also put in her firing line at the protections for sexual harassment for schoolchildren. So there was a lot of really reactionary activity going on from Betsy DeVos when she was education secretary. And then when you look at the sort of background of her and her family, you start to see okay, well, she was part of this thing called a Dutch Reformed Church, which was a very reactionary church, very anti abortion, very anti LGBT. Her, her foundation that she runs with her husband funds, anti gender, organizing anti gender campaigning all across the world, as a foundation that is linked to her family, the prince family, so you know, maiden name is Prince. And I think this is when it gets really interesting. Have you

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:18:07.000
    | text      = right? Yes. But it gets really interesting hold of these families are so connected, and these funding streams become very connected, and they're coming from this really shared ideology, and how they use that money from, you know, all sorts of different sources of wealth to try and influence abortion rights all around the world. So I think it's really concerning that these, you know, again, maybe just in America, very, very wealthy individuals have taken on this ideology. And I'm trying to import it, and, you know, force that ideology on to more. I mean, I don't like the word more vulnerable populations, but that is kind of the terminology we use, I guess. So, you know, was it might not have the same health infrastructure, or the same infrastructure around women's rights? And, yeah, it's a really dangerous combination.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:18:58.000
    | text      = Well, I mean, you know, it's hard not to say vulnerable when the reason for the vulnerability is because they've been denied so much by the people who are also destroying them now. So it's not a vulnerability, it's, it's fucking trauma throughout that entire time. And that's why I there was a line that I really, really appreciated, which was without access to reproductive, why rights women can never be free, which is a good line. But I was wanting to ask you, what does that freedom actually look like? Do you know what I mean? Like right now? Yeah, I would argue that the vast majority of human beings on this planet believe in some form of restricting women's reproductive rights one way or the other. So how is it that we see that actual freedom for reproductive rights?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:19:53.000
    | text      = So to me, it's that freedom, is it. It's sort of about reproductive justice. So the idea is that when when when we have reproductive rights or reproductive justice and women can be free. And that means that we have the choice to control our own fertility, the choice to end a pregnancy, that we don't want to have the choice to continue a pregnancy that we do want to have. And then when that baby is born that wanted baby, we can have access to secure housing, to education, to social welfare, to work. And for that work, to be flexible, and to be supportive of the family that you want to have. And I think that's a really important aspect of women's freedom. It's not just about saying, Oh, you have a right to abortion, it's also about saying that you have the right to, you know, the families that you want, and the support that needs to be in place for you to achieve that. And I think fundamentally, you know, I say that we can't be free unless we have reproductive rights, is because the driving force behind the anti abortion movement is to control women, and to control women's bodies, and to put women's bodies to work to reproductive exploiters for reproductive labor. And as long as we're saying that it's possible for someone else to control and own our bodies, then we can never be free. And when we say that, actually, I get to decide what happens to my body. And again, that expands beyond just having an abortion that can be who I want to have sex with how I want to have sex with that person, you know, whether I want to have a baby at all, it's like, when we give up that space, when that right is taken away from us, that very bodily freedom is denied to us.

    | text      = Right, right. I mean, but that's that, I suppose, is my question. I mean, I feel like our society when I'm reading through your book, it is hard not to continually make these connections that basically, our entire culture is in some form or another based around commodification of women's bodies, control of women's bodies that say, you know, I was thinking, the, you know, we we've often described sex work as the oldest profession. And the more I think about it, the more I think that is the entire basis for capitalism, selling women's bodies in one way or another without their consent or control. So, in essence, if you want to have full reproductive rights, it has to be the entire system that goes, right.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:22:23.000
    | text      = Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I would say so. I think one of the really interesting things to look at is Sylvia Federici, his work and she wrote this book called Caliban and the witch which looks at the links between reproductive rights or reproductive exploitation and the roots of capitalism. And reading that book was just such a lightbulb moment. For me, it was like one of those moments being like, oh, okay, this all makes sense. This was planned. Like, this is how it's supposed to be. And I don't like it. And I want to change it. Yeah. But it's absolutely

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:22:58.000
    | text      = yeah. And it's absolutely about that this idea that women's bodies are put to work in order to create the next generation of workers. So women's bodies need to be constantly reproducing, otherwise, the capitalist system collapses. And it's really interesting stuff, both in Federici his work and in Angela Davis's work about how that links to the enslavement of African American people. And how black women who are enslaved, you know, if they ended a pregnancy, that wasn't seen as her having an abortion or anything to do with her body that was seen as her stealing from the enslaved from this one. So as soon as you sort of eat these connections are suddenly like, okay, because that's what women's bodies are for in this society. And to deny that to say, actually, I'm not going to play a part in that actually, I want to have control over my own body. I don't see myself as a reproductive vessel. It's like, Oh, that is too much. You cannot have that that would, you know, that is women's freedom. And that allows freedom for everyone. And so it has to be stopped.

The thing that I can't get out of my head about that is how obsessed in cells are with controlling women's bodies. But oh my gosh, yeah. It's it's like, they're also miserably unhappy all the time. And they blame their inability to control women's bodies for that misery, but it wouldn't make them happy. Do you know what I mean? Like even if there was control, even if they had complete control, it would only be a different form of misery. How is it that that is so constantly exploited by people who are only benefited by it?

But but in order to, for these ideologies to ferment in the first place, they need to, as you say, start somewhere. It needs to be the egg that hatches. Exactly. And I mean, I think one of the sort of complicated things with abortion rights is how it has been a very long standing route, you know, Rose 50 years old, before it was overturned, you know, that kind of the backlash against roe started even before it had come into law, right, like these organic people were organizing. Well, I think
}}

{{TranscriptBlock

Well, you know, it's almost like every 50 years, some assholes are good enough at propaganda to convince people that abortion is so wrong, that they have to ban it, or they have to unban it, you know, it is it's just a never ending cycle.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sian Norris
    | timestamp = 00:31:03.000
    | text      = But I think that's interesting as well, because one of the points that I make in the book is when abortion was banned in the states in the 1860s, it was coming from a position of anxiety about women's in political empowerment, and rising rates of immigration. That is where we are now, you know, the, the panic around abortion rights is coming from this great replacement conspiracy theory, which was we hear parroted by mainstream politicians now. And, you know, women's political empowerment, this is like, post me to where women are supposed to be doing better than ever, like, right, and yet, suddenly, so that it's like, oh, shit, we've got to take her rights away, we've got to have this backlash. And we've seen that throughout history in Weimar Germany, pre sort of the Nazi era, in 20, early 20th century Italy, before fascism, women's empowerment, growing immigration becoming higher up the agenda, and then bam, we ban abortion rights. So I think in terms of where it comes from, it's kind of like the ways in which political narratives take hold on these sort of intersecting issues around race, gender, sex, and immigration, in order to kind of ferment insecurity, and fuel, anger and fuel resentment, which then allows for this backlash to happen. And so it's that kind of meeting point between the activists and the politicians and the funders, that creates this whirlpool of hate and anger. And that is, yeah, whether that starts with a politician who stands up going, we've got a problem with immigration and as a low birth rate, or whatever, it starts with the guy on line going. I'm really, that's a massive replacement. And women are aiding it because of their all of their abortions. It's the same thing, it's just a different way of phrasing it.

And so I think there's this reluctance to kind of punch up because, number one, it's harder to take on a whole huge system. And number two, you think, Oh, well, I wouldn't mind a slice of that pie.

    | text      = So I mean, I think a lot of people reach for the really obvious message that like, patriarchy hurts men too. And, you know, capitalism hurts all of us. And I think we need to, like start putting forward. And I'm always like, yeah, patriarchy does hurt men too, but also men benefit from patriarchy. And that's why we've got it, like, you know, two things can be true at once. So I think we just need to like, and I felt like this, going back to 2016, when it was the referendum in the UK of a Brexit, the remain campaign, which I voted for came out with such negative messaging, it was all just like, if you vote for brexit, the whole economy is going to collapse. And everything was terrible. And turned out they were right. But there was no sort of positive vision for what remaining in the EU would look like there was no sense of like, if I vote remain is going to create a stronger Euro, I'm gonna have access to, even if they just said back to remain in the EU, and you won't have to queue at the airport anymore. Like, yeah, just like a positive vision. And I think that's what we really need to start doing for women's rights and human rights across the board. So one of the really exciting things that happened last, I think it was last year was there was a referendum in Hungary about LGBTQ plus rights. And the pro LGBTQ campaign went out. And they told really positive stories about gay people's lives, or LGBTQ people's lives. And they spoke about how your friend or your son or your daughter, or your auntie could be gay, you know, it was like, we're a community, we're in your community, we were all part of this. And, and they weren't like the referendum that the result that the government wanted, you know, didn't have didn't happen. They, the government failed to enact some of the repressive legislation that they wanted to enact, they obviously have put in some other things. And I think, going out with that really positive message, like gave people a reason to vote in favor, because they're like, yeah, actually, my next door neighbor is gay. And I really like him. And we have a really great time. And we both like, we talked about our dogs, and as opposed to always kind of going, everything's terrible, everything's terrible, things are gonna get worse, things are gonna get worse. Like, and it was one of the things that there was a film called, yes, which was about the Chilean referendum. And it was just, that was the sort of message of that film of like, show, show what a positive difference can be made. If you believe in human rights, and you support human rights, you know, you'll have half, you know, women won't be dying. Like, you'll have like, Healthy Families, happy communities, like the people that you love will be better cared for and have, you know, better mental health and will have stronger economies and all of these things can happen. But I think for understandable reasons, we can be very negative because things are very, very bad right now. But if we're going to win, we need to start showing what winning means and what change could look like.

And that there's really, I mean, no, no strategy to deal with that. So, is it? Is it something honestly where it should be? Should we find a way to lessen their ability to commit violence? Or, honestly, I mean, it's terrifying. And what you wrote in the book makes me feel like maybe I should start learning how to use a gun. Do you know what I mean?

I mean, obviously, that underpins that, that is, underpins gender inequality, like, you know, again, we can't be equal, we can't be free, so long as men use violence against women to, to control and, and subdue women. But I think, again, it's about making that case for like, why women's rights are important. You know, we know that the more equality women can get, the more we have gender equality, that the more we can impact and reduce the levels of male violence, you know, more, because women are respected and seen as human, and seen as having equal value to men. And so there's no reason to be violent towards those. And I think it's again, it's about really striving to see women's rights as something that is positive for society and positive for men as well. Because, yeah, like, it doesn't have to be this way. And and, you know, men's violence is a sort of tool of patriarchy, and patriarchy is so linked to capitalism. But if we fight for a fairer and more equal society, you don't need to keep control for violent means, because there isn't that need for control in the first place.

And servita is, is really a message to the United States, like, because this is coming to your doors, like women will die as a result of jobs. And the reason they will die is because you have told doctors that they will go to prison, if they act. And so you have doctors who, you know, want to help women, they want to do the things that they used to do they want to perform surgical abortions, that will save women's lives. But if you're constantly being told that that could result in you going to prison for life, and you think there's a teeny tiny chance that this woman will pull through and abort debate the fetus naturally, then of course, you're gonna keep holding and holding and holding until there's no options left.

And I think the really scary thing about that I've seen coming out of the anti abortion movement in the US is they're already preparing for when the women start to die by saying, Oh, well, the law allows the doctors to intervene and if the doctor doesn't intervene, and that's the doctors fault. And it's like, no, the law is really murky. The laws are not clear. There's not a moment in the law where it's only like a now you can intervene and everybody will agree that this was the moment. So by creating these bad laws, and failing to recognize the medical realities of women's bodies, and not respecting doctor's expertise, this is this is what happens this is a result Have those bands. And, you know, I remember really just thinking when the women in Poland died because she was the same age as me when she died. And I just kept coming back to that I was like, You're the same age as me. And you're, you know, you've died because you weren't allowed to have a surgical abortion that would have saved your life like that. The horror of it is, I still really, really feel the horror of like that news story and what the woman's mother said and the video of her, you know, it was just a really horrifying, I don't want to say tragedy, because it's not a tragedy when it's deliberate

I think what happened with the Polish death deaths, and what will happen when women start to die in the US is like, this is the start.

And as long as we see abortion as something that's around a moral issue, or a criminal issue, is always going to be vulnerable to these kinds of bands and these kinds of restrictions. But as long as if we start talking about abortion as healthcare, and valuing it as women's access to health care, then we can start to have real change.

That's that's what we can see if you have political appointments in a judiciary that is open to abuse. And that's what we're seeing in different legislators around Europe as well, I think there's this sort of feeling that it's only in the US Batchi political appointments in the Supreme Courts in different European countries is also having profound implications on people's rights.

So obviously, the main example is Ireland, you know, what we saw in Ireland was just an unbelievable show of what happens when you don't compromise on advocating for reproductive rights. When you you go out there, and you say, This is what women need and deserve. Abortion is health care. And every woman should have a right to control her own body. And we saw feminist organizations and human rights organizations come together as a coalition, and I spoke to one of the leaders of the coalition just like, you know, after day after the referendum, we're all back to rowing again. This time period was like, Wait, we have one goal, and we're gonna unify and we're gonna go after it. And, you know, it was never given that the yes side would win the referendum. It was always felt very touching go the no side. So the the ones who wanted to keep the Eighth Amendment once he wanted to keep the abortion ban, when added with everything, you know, just very, very vicious campaigning, very graphic campaigning, US actors coming in to Ireland to sort of spread the anti abortion message. And it didn't work in

And now Ireland has more, you know, as a liberal abortion laws. Similarly, in the UK, we've we've seen progress in that abortion was finally decriminalized in Northern Ireland. So Northern Ireland was not covered by the 1967 abortion Act, which allowed for abortion in certain circumstances in the rest of the UK. And it's taken a lot of like political campaigning, and, you know, some problematic political campaigning to get it decriminalized in Northern Ireland. And then in Britain, we've had, you know, buffer zones implemented so people can no longer go and harass women outside of clinics, we've had changes to the law that allow women to take abortion pills at home. So we have seen like positive progress and abortion rights in our little corner of Europe. And I think one of the messages of Roe as well was that while it's been a disaster for the US, and has emboldened the anti abortion movement around the world, is also kind of put some fire into the pro abortion movement in that, you know, we, like other nations have been like, Okay, we need to actually do some more to protect abortion rights in our own constitutions. And when I reported on roe being overruled back back in last year, I spoke to layer doctor from the Center for Reproductive Rights and she was like, Look, this is really terrible. But one thing to remember is that since 1973, I think 50 free countries have improved access to abortion, and only four countries have rolled, rolled it back. So

You know, actually we can, there's, there's a famous phrase that Joe Cox said the MP who was killed, like, there's more that unites us than divides us, you know, with that we have more in common than what, then what we want what devices and I think we should remember that as the left movement and the feminist movement, we've got common goals, and we can fight for them, and we can move towards them. And yeah, it doesn't mean we have to like each other doesn't mean we disagree on on some things. But actually, if we're fighting for women's freedoms, then we have to, we have to really go for that. And, you know, I come from the British left, we're always screaming at each other. We've got, we've got a shared goal and a shared vision and we can achieve it.
