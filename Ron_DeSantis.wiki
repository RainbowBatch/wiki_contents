Ron Desantis is the current Governer of Florida, and a GOP Presidential Hopeful. At one time he looked to be a rival to Trump, but as of the time of writing, he looks a lot more like a crazy Jeb Bush.

Desantis likes to engage in a bunch of crazy, InfoWars adjacent political stunts, but still expects to be taken seriously by the mainstream. Somehow, this seems to work for him inside Florida, but has been notably less effective on the national stage.
