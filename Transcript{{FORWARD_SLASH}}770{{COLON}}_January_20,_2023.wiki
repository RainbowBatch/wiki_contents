Right. And thankfully, he did exactly that. The door is now open for me to talk at length about my feelings regarding this whole right wing media chaos. The first thing I want to point out though, is that Alex is not above talking about petty drama, that's a very large portion of his shows content, possibly second only to ranting about made up headlines.

I realized that many people probably have no idea what Steven Crowder has been doing. So here's a little recap. For a while now, Stephen has worked for Glenn Beck's network, the blaze. Crowder has a large audience on YouTube, but he's also demonetised on there and his exclusive membership group the mug Club was run through the blaze. Steven is no longer with the blaze. But toward the end of his time there he was apparently entertaining offers for who wanted to buy his whole thing. The daily wire put in an introductory offer that was very generous to the tune of $50 million over four years. The offer was a starting point and potential negotiations and overall is a pretty standard sounding contract for a lot of the things that even Crowder was complaining about great real basic stuff. Okay. I know the details of this contract, because Jeremy boring, the head of daily wired decided to reveal it all after being called out by Crowder. Yeah,

Anyway, essentially, Stephen misunderstood or intentionally misrepresented various aspects of the offer to make it appear as if the daily wire was in bed with big tech, and they were doing their bidding. For instance, the offer specified that if Stephen got kicked off social media platforms for something he said his pay would be decreased. Obviously, this makes sense because the company would be making less money as a result of the ban and their business. Right? They take a hit and so does Stephen. In Stephens mind. This was the daily wire saying that big tech, hey, we'll do your job for you. We'll punish Stephen on your behalf like they're, they're in cahoots with the social media moderators to decrease Steven salary. To me it sounds

Now to have a next chapter what you want that next chapter to be. And Stephens agent, candidly, just wasn't interested in any aspect of that conversation. He only wanted to know about the money, he said, you know, we're not going to have a conversation, we're gonna have some abstract talk, we're gonna send us an offer, tell us how much money you're willing to pay. And he gave us an indication of what the minimum number would have to be in order to even have a discussion with Stephen. And it's a big number. So we talked about it internally. And we decided, yeah, we should do that which had send over an opening offer a non binding term sheet that takes a stab at what we think that that minimum number is going to be to get the conversation started. So we can sit down with Steven so that we can see if, if there's a deal, they'd be good for him and good for us. And that's what we did we, we put together the term sheet.

They'll learn and he'll growth, he's a smart, talented guy. And I hope he gets to a place where he's proving me wrong, and he's making all that money. But that just was not a deal that the daily wire could possibly make. And we'd have to pay it, even if he lost all the revenue. Or even if he lost enormous chunks of the revenue.

I just realized what I already knew in my heart, which is Stephens, not a team player. That's not a knock. He has an enormous individual talent. Why? This? So I called him up. I said, Hey, we're not going to send a follow up offer want you to hear it directly from me and not from lawyers and agents. I said, but the kind of deal you're looking for is not the kind of deal that we can make. It was super gracious, appreciative kind, we agreed to continue forward as we always had as friends, we do favors for each other. I told him, you stay at the blazer, if you go off on your own, go to rumble go wherever we're going to continue to write stories about you and promote you and have you on like, we want you to be as successful as humanly possible. We want to contribute to that. And we went our separate ways. And months went by October goes by November goes by December goes by. And then a week ago, in January, Stephen called me and he said, Hey, man, I can't unsee this contract that you sent me. It was not a contract is a non binding term sheet. It's a conversation starter, but okay. And he told me his perspective on it, that we were not paying him what he's worth, that we don't understand his great business mind and that he's just gonna go exactly the way he the way that he thinks we're all going to be proven wrong. I said, again, I hope that's true, Steven, but that's not a risk I can take. And then he said, and you're just an enforcer for big tech, you're hurting young talent. So we'll see. And first of all, no two talent in our company have the same deal. Every deal is different, because there's different circumstances, this is the kind of deal you make to protect a nine figure investment. You can't pay nine figures and expenses. Even if the revenue draw dries up. That isn't possible. It's not prudent, but it also isn't possible. And he wouldn't let it go. He was very angry. And I got very flustered. I didn't expect him to be calling inland into me the way it was. I've never experienced it before. I didn't make the best defense of the deal that I probably could have because I was so caught off guard. I mean, I made a decent defense of the structure of it, but I was really taken aback.

    | text      = Yeah. Anyway, here's the point. Stevens deal was ending at the blaze. And it seems like they weren't interested in paying him what he was asking to renew the deal. If I had to guess it might have been because his actual numbers weren't as good as Stephen thinks they are. The investment wasn't worth it. So they passed. Needing a new home. Stephen tried to play hardball with the daily wire months back and it didn't work. Without proof of his draw. They couldn't justify paying him what he demanded. And Stephen probably wasn't able to provide them with any numbers, since he admitted that all that stuff was handled by the blaze. And it's unclear if they even knew about the negotiations since he was still under contract. Oh boy. months back, Stephen thought he could find a new place to make a huge guaranteed chunk of money free from any market pressures, but it didn't work out. And now guess what? There are no other options. He isn't going to make that kind of money anywhere else other than maybe Fox News, and I don't think he's quite their brand. They already have their funny guy. They don't need him. Then they've got

It was clearly a calculated move. And the idea obviously, was to try to poach some of the daily wires audience, presumably drawing them to Stephens independent operation, that he's going to now have to figure out how to get off the ground right. This past week has been when the big reveal has happened. And Stephen has done some pieces on his show. But this whole mess, Jeremy boring, put out his response video explaining the offer in minut detail for an hour,

Yeah, the daily wire will continue to exist. Steven Crowder will continue to be a rich bigot somehow and everyone who move on. However underneath this drama, there are a couple of points that make it critically important for Alex if he wants to profit from this. The first thing I saw that you needed to do was side with Crowder and it's a good thing he jumped on that. The daily wire doesn't want shit to do with Alex and all the hosts on there probably or definitely hate him. Alex isn't going to be talking with Jordan Peterson Ben Shapiro or Matt Walsh anytime soon. And Candace Owens may have been on Infowars in the past, but her brand is way bigger. Now. Siding with these people is a waste whereas Crowder still has Alex on his show. That's where Alex's bread is buttered, but it introduces other problems that we'll get to as we go as time goes along. I see. So Alex says he's got the inside baseball, right? He's gonna provide everybody with the deets,

Of course, it is something that can raise both ships, rat beef attention will be given to both they can both come out better for it. The problem is he picked the wrong thing to make the beef about the beef being about first of all contracts. And second of all money touches on things that the right wing media ecosystem cannot engage with.

But I didn't want to go there until I checked it. My analysis was correct. Crowder is as good as it gets a real patriot American. And he loves the country. And he's a really smart, reasonable guy. He left the blaze because he was like 80% of their money. And he was almost being paid nothing. Then when he went and interviewed with the people over at Ben Shapiro's operation, the daily wire, they sent him the contracts that said, we're gonna control everything you say, control, whatever you do, and we'll withdraw your funds and your tight end for five years, no matter what if you get censored by big tech, essentially making big tech his boss and then he just criticized them on air without saying their names. So some of them attacked him. So he released recordings of them basically admitting that, and his issue was he didn't take the deal. Because he's not going to be shackled.

    | text      = don't expect me to have the numbers but I would expect Jeremy boring to have the numbers Oh, they were in opening up a negotiation. 100% So anyway, to be clear, I hate the daily wire and Jeremy boring sucks, but I definitely believe his side of the story way more for a number of reasons. The first and most important reason is that his story makes sense, whereas Stevens does not. Stevens actions and motivations don't make sense if you take them at his word, whereas borings explanation of the contract and the timeline are sane, rational sequences of events. And here, I feel like Stephen definitely doesn't know how many subscribers he has. If he did, and the number was as high as he's claiming he would use that to his advantage in the context of negotiations, how it works, it could only help make the case for his demand for higher pay. So the fact that he doesn't cite it can only really mean that he doesn't know or he does know, and it's way lower than you think. Yeah. Beyond that Alex is wrong about what the author of The Daily wire sent included. He's just parroting Crowder. It is true that Steven didn't name daily wire in the first video he did, but I don't think that's to his credit. After Stephen did his first beast boring came out and did his response. And the reason for that makes total sense. Everyone knew Crowder was talking about them, and they have a business to protect daily wire subscribers were worried that will Crowder was saying was correct and if left unanswered, people might assume it was correct, and that could cut into their profits. Essentially, they would have to accept Crowder's framing of things when it's obvious he's talking about them. What other business is there that might have been able to afford this kind of a deal to hire him? Yeah. After that, all of the daily wire hosts began to shit on Crowder, all of his presumed allies like Candace Owens and Matt Walsh, hit back pretty hard and there's a good reason for it. For one thing, Crowder's behavior is much like a sneaky snake. Perhaps more importantly, though, by saying that the daily wires contract is tantamount to him becoming a slave to big tech, he's implicitly calling out everyone who's under contract at the Daily wire. He's boasting of his principles and not signing this deal, which by extension is a condemnation of the people who did yeah. Yep. That's not good. You're you're stabbing all your friends in the back.

And they look just like you a plumber working a 12 hour day, a farmer working a 12 hour day. Those these people cannot hide in a manual job. They can never hack it, never do it. Again. Thomas Jefferson said he studied all different types of people. He'd been all over Europe, very learned man knows in college when he was you know, 1213 years old. He did not say this. And he said nobody's better than the farmers. And back then they didn't call them ranchers, the ranchers. He said the best people are the farmers. And the hardest working most successful farmers are the best people. And they should run things, not lawyers. And it's true.

Yeah, good luck running a radio and TV show that relies on selling bullshit supplements and an Amish community though that's gonna be really tough. While we're on the subject. From a doctrine perspective, Alex would have severe problems with the Amish because they come from a branch of Christianity called Anna baptism. Groups derived from Anabaptists like the Amish Mennonites, and Quakers do not believe in child baptism. A faith can only be sincere if it's entered into by a conscious informed decision, which is absolutely counter to Alex's belief surrounding baptism. Alex is a caricature of Amish people in his head that he's decided to accept and admire, but it's not real. Plus, there are plenty of crimes and Amish communities. You don't hear about a lot of it because the communities are very insulated. And many of the doctrines make it difficult to get people to cooperate with the process of prosecuting a crime. But there are criminals among the very hard working Amish. If you want to, you can find plenty of stories that Alex would call demonic if a liberal were involved. But it's Amish people. So he's never heard about it. And doesn't pretend it doesn't exist. Yeah, that obviously doesn't characterize the entire Amish community.

    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 01:10:21.000
    | text      = So the first glaring problem is that Stephen didn't release the full call. It's possible that wage slave as a comment was boring using an expression that Stephen had used earlier in that conversation. And there's no way to know for sure, right, right. Even assuming that was how boring decided to construct his thought there are still problems. One is that he's trying to explain to Stephen how good the deal he's being offered is. And that's because it's an insanely good deal. Boring is trying to help Stephen understand that they would be making a gigantic investment in him. And because it would be a huge deal. It requires a contract that spells stuff out and make sure that the daily wire doesn't end up losing $50 million, which is not something that you need to be concerned about with younger talents. The other more important problem that comes up here is that these people don't have a problem with wage slavery. Go over to daily wires website and see what they have to say about suggestions that the minimum wage should be raised right, poke around for a minute and see how many videos you can find where Steven Crowder screams about his opposition to be people being paid a living wage, they don't have a problem with this and those personal the conservative ideas that you're paid what you're worth, and what you're worth is what an employer will pay you. If you bring in $2 worth of value to an employer per hour, you should be paid $2 an hour, Crowder should recognize that the younger creators that boring is talking about don't bring in $50 million in value, they bring in what he would call slave wages and value to the daily wire. So they get paid accordingly. The arrangement is beneficial for them because they get paid something and their association with the daily wire raises their profile and allows them to create their own personal brand. Without his association with the daily wire, I guarantee no one would give a single shit about what Matt Walsh has to say, No, you'd have no idea who he was, it works out quite well for him. That's the game. There's a little bit of a weird wrinkle here. I also would never sign this deal. But I don't think it's inherently unfair as a deal. Typically, a network will require ownership of the material you make while you're under their contract, which is a fairly normal thing. And you hear boring express that in the call, the content that Crowder makes under the auspices of the contract are owned by the daily wire, but they don't own his brand or the mug club or things that he does post contract period or before, right. I've spoken to people who are with podcast networks, and this is how a lot of podcasts networks operate. And that's definitely one of the sticking points that I've had with the idea of ever joining one. But I don't think it's inherently unethical. No. And I think for a number of different types of content, it makes a lot of sense.

And he's got to figure out how to survive on his own. The best way to do this is to pretend he's concerned about the other creators who are being exploited by these contracts, which is a great way to fake selflessness honestly, interestingly, though, none of the other creators sided with Steven. In fact, Steven may have alienated most of the conservative media with this shit. Yeah. And it's because of two reasons. The first is that he's shown himself to be a duplicitous, backstabbing, sneaky snake, so might be recording you at any moment. So he can use cherry pick things you say against you. You got it. He's willing to exploit people who thought they were his friends in order to garner attention. But that's not really a deal breaker for these people. They could get over that pretty easily.

But Stevens never had to create the company that actually distributes markets and monetizes all of that content. You know, he talks in his video about being one of the only true independent conservative voices and I find that incredibly unfair have, you know, Stephen? The whole time I've known him has worked for someone else has been paid by someone else. That doesn't mean other people tell him what to say. He's a very independent voice and and that's good. So isn't that Walsh. So as Candace Owens so as Ben Shapiro, so as Michael Knowles, so is Brett Cooper. But Stephen, you know, as much or more than any of them a very independent voice. But he's not exactly a self made man. That's not true. He he was paid by PJ TV when I met him, which was owned by a billionaire at the time. Then he was paid by CR TV for a number of years, which was owned by a billionaire at the time. Then he was paid by the blaze, which was subsidized by a billionaire.

Or maybe this one been watching Stephen since I was 13. But his recent actions are seriously disappointing. It's not a YouTube comment. But even Mike Cernovich tweeted about this big shitty That's Mike serval. So here's the deal. Crowder did did this to get a ton of attention and direct people to his new website stop big con.com Share he repeated in his videos big con is in bed with big tech. Trying to label big con is big conservative media, whatever. So that's his site that he set up to farm email addresses to create a new database since the blaze probably owns his old one. He says on his site quote, please go to Big stop big con.com and enter your email. This isn't just for louder with Crowder This is a petition to show big con How many of you out there want business practices like this to stop? If you're if you want your conservative allies in quotes to stop shilling for big tech Can muzzling their creators, please go sign your name. If you click the link, there isn't a petition. It's just an email input form. Some people have deduced that Crowder, registered this domain stop big con.com prior to making that phone call to boring, which he recorded and is currently using as the entire inciting incident for his campaign to stop big conservative media who are just in bed with big tech, which kind of doesn't make sense. No. On the surface, it's a pretty standard and block kind of conservative media grift. But the idea that Crowder didn't think people would put some of these pieces together is pretty laughable. And here's the big problem for Crowder, he's a tool. He's not important. Ultimately, he's just somebody that the billionaires have paid to push right wing ideas to teams. Yeah, the daily wire is important. That's a burgeoning institution with its own media wing and projects in the works for educational programming and conservative alternatives to mainstream culture. This is a giant project that is much stronger and much more supported than Crowder. That is a fight he is not going to win.
