}}The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (sometimes abbreviated as PEZ) is a wildly anti-semitic forgery. If first appeared in Russia in 1903. It had the intent of justifying (and the effect of inflaming) violence against Jewish peoples in Russia. Within a few short years, the writings, and the ideas contained within them spread world-wide, helped along by rich antisemites like Henry Ford. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum puts it well when they say the document claims to lay out a plan "to rule the world by manipulating the economy, controlling the media, and fostering religious conflict"<ref>https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion</ref>.

Summarizing the content and history of the Protocols point by point here would be unnecessary and irresponsible. Instead, refer you to [https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion the documentation put out by the USHMM], or [[67: Protocols of Zion|Episode #67: Protocols of Zion]].

False claims made in the Protocols closely mirror [[Alex Jones]]' claims about the [[Globalists]]. Since many people covered by the Knowledge Fight seem to source their ideas from the PEZ, Dan and Jordan have coined the term [[PEZ Dispenser]] as a shorthand.
