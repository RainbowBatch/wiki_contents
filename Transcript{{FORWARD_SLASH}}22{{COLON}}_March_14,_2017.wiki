Yeah, basically. Yeah. And I mean, come on. It's a joke. It's a joke. And as we've documented Alex has a dubious grasp on race. Yeah. So the idea that they're mocking that doesn't mean that people the point that they're making isn't that Alex thinks the black people are aliens. I think exaggerating it for comedic effect.

Also, a September 2016 Des Moines Register article describe the racial tensions in this particular school district in Iowa, a culture of quote deep racial disparity exists in the Valley High School creating an inequitable toxic environment for students of color. According to a report from the Iowa State University researchers, the audit found that students of color at the West Des Moines High School are more likely to be labeled as special needs and at risk than their white peers. Students of Color are also more likely to face discipline or suspension and less likely to be tapped for gifted programs. And this is a quote from the researchers, the traditions, curriculum and common teaching methods within the school. Assume students upper class whiteness is the norm or archetype, which can marginalize and demoralize students of color, whether intended or not. Now that's interesting and about Hold on. That's about a lot of education as a whole. You can accept that. Yep. Now here's where it gets nowhere specific. Yep. The report comes more than a year after violent confrontations between students prompted a series of community discussions on race relations at the school. There were like basically race fights. Yeah, at this Iowa School. Yep. And so maybe that's the kind of climate that we're living in and has nothing to do with the fact that they're wearing red, white and blue. There's a big racism ism problem at Valley High School in Iowa. And of course, it's not commonly reported because why would it be it's a high school in the middle of America?

And then and then maybe you could just disappear and nothing's gonna happen. But she's a human being. And this isn't going to go well. I mean, what are you going to do with her? It's the same thing.

Soros is doubling the amount of money he's putting out. Soros needs to be tried. Soros has in my opinion, committed many crimes. Soros has meddled in elections. We keep hearing about Russia meddling in elections, he should be locked up for being a Nazi collaborator 65 years ago. Let's put that aside. No one will ever believe that. But they will come to understand what the Senate hearing how this emigre immigrant to America gave $65 million to the violent Black Lives Matter movement. And I have five pages in Trump's war you have to see this Alex, I don't know if you saw this. I named every subversive group in America saw money from from George Soros.

Sure, because when they were raised, we were still in that economic boom from the New Deal. We were still in that steady growth with no burst and no bubbles in that whole thing. So of course, they would imagine, well, things aren't perfect now. So what we do is we change this shit. And they forget that the whole reason they had to do the New Deal in the first place was because of the very same shit that they just allowed. Yeah, they're trying to reintroduce, and they don't get that that is stupid because our attention spans are non existent.
