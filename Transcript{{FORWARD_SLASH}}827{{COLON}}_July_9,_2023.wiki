I'm usually way ahead of the curve, except when you're so far ahead of the curve, you kind of already know all this stuff. What's Hollywood, even if it's Christian Hollywood gonna show me. I mean, the UN has kidnapped hundreds of 1000s of women and children. We know how to put them in sex slavery. And it used to be all over the news, London Guardian Associated Press until about 10 years ago. And big tech got so good at control that you don't even see that stuff anymore.

And that is about UN peacekeepers who did abuse children in countries like Haiti. And one of the issues that if you actually read these articles, one of the issues that they have with dealing with these problems is that the UN doesn't have jurisdiction over these peacekeepers, the country of origin, where they came from, has the ability to prosecute them for these things. And some of these countries don't do that. Right, right. It's a big mess. But Alex isn't that he takes that and he's like, hundreds of 1000s of people are kidnapped. And it's it's a lot of ballyhoo.

    | text      = So I'm not gonna get into the stuff about the movie too deeply, because I think it's been covered pretty heavily elsewhere. And I think the folks who've done the work on this story have done a really good job and there's not a lot more that I can bring to the table. Essentially, there's this new movie called The sound of freedom, which purports to tell the true story of a guy named Tim Bellard who runs a traffic children rescue group called Operation underground railroad. The film is definitely not an accurate depiction of a true story. But the reality is that Tim and Oh, you are has a real issue with accuracy and has for a long time. Anna, Merlin has done a lot of work on this particular case for years and you can find articles on vice laying out a lot of the holes in these people's stories. One of the more damning stories is about a trafficking survivor who's referred to by the student named Liliana without getting into too many details. Liliana was a 14 year old in Mexico who was romantically entrapped by a trafficker. He used that relationship style of grooming to lure her to come to the US where she was kept in an apartment and forced into sex work. After approximately three and a half years Liliana escaped based on her own will to get out. However, Tim Bellard and oh EUR have told a different version of the story where they claim that Liliana was kidnapped and they quote helped her escape her Hell, he would go on to tell various versions of this story with so many details exaggerated. There are many, many instances one could point to to illustrate dishonesty on the part of Bellard but there isn't anything that I find as clear as this case. To make matters even worse, he used Lilyana story for political purposes in his advocacy for building a border wall. If you ever make a move like this, you're disqualified. I understand mixing up some details of some stories every now and again. And I even understand fudging stuff when you're trying to turn a real life event into a movie. And I wouldn't be overly critical of things like that. Especially when it comes to like making the movie there's probably like studio involvement and like,

Here. He's saying that because their article is critical of the sound of freedom, that means that the media is saying that trafficking does didn't exist. Essentially, the media supports trial child traffickers because they're critical of the movie. But that's not true. Just about every article about how the movie sucks includes comments from actual anti trafficking organizations who talk about how sensationalizing the issue does a disservice to attempt to actually help victims. The media doesn't support trafficking or say that it doesn't exist. It's just clear that this movie is bullshit. Anyone who looks at this situation with any kind of a critical eye would understand this. But this kind of rhetoric that Alex is deploying is meant to make sure no one approaches with anything close to a critical eye. If you see a headline about how Bellard or Oh, EUR have made false claims in the past, you can just ignore it because those people don't think that trafficking even exists. The claims that they're probably saying are false is like that trafficking is real. So who cares? Just discount all that criticism. Yeah, just just lies by the pedophile supporting media

Conversely, sound of freedom made 21 point 9 million in its first week, in some might say that sound freedom opened up fewer theaters. And that is correct. So you know, they might be thinking that the average per theater is better for that movie than Indiana Jones. And that's also that's not correct. Indiana Jones opened on 4600 theaters on screens, and sound of freedom in 20 634. Even with that difference, Indiana Jones made over double per theater that it opened in. And then this past weekend, Indiana Jones made $27 million, putting it at number two for the weekend. But sound the freedom was at number three with a 19 million insidious the red door atop the weekend chart, whatever the fuck that is. It's another insidious move. I assumed that but I also don't know if that means. I have someone who worked in theaters for many years, including at the management level where I needed to assess performance of movies and set screening schedules for upcoming weeks. This all looks pretty normal, like sound of freedom was an unexpected success. But it probably isn't going to do much better at the box office moving forward. It got the right wing media blitz to bring people out with a fourth of July release date. And they did what they could with it, which is you know, pretty impressive. But it's not going to actually outdo a box office draw. And it's not gonna come close to like spider verse that's already at like 300 something million dollars. Well,

Like it occurs to me that in a very specific, like in a controlled environment, because of the way that words work between the between all of these people, like Dead Prez and Alex could sit down. And as long as you stayed on the same path, they would say the exact same words and be like, I can't believe I agree with you so much writing completely different things.

And that is where you're pointing to some hypocrisy, when, in fact, your criticism is for Biden about the sale or sending those bombs. Yeah, I mean, it's it's not a war crime, technically, to use cluster bombs. The United States, Russia and Ukraine have not signed on to that Non Proliferation agreement that a lot of the world is signed on to. So it's not against that.

There's a headline, and that is about China restricting the export of a couple of precious metals. Sure. And the headline puts it as a warning shot. China of fires a warning shot, right. And so Alex spends a long time pontificating on this. And I'm just gonna play this bit of it.

That's your answer. It's not why does China have Why is China doing this? Why is China got us by the ball squeezing them?

So Alex is reporting on this story about China putting restrictions in place for the export of two rare metals, gallium and germanium. He's saying that they're cutting off the whole supply and that you can't make any microchips without these two metals, which is not true. Then on top of that, the conspiracy is really that the US has tons and tons of these metals stockpiled up, but they're gonna pretend the China's cutting us off. So we can't have any more chips, presumably to heighten tensions are a guest to let China take over the world, which would make the advanced stockpiling of these metals kind of pointless. And then we get to this clip where apparently it's about God and the devil and an age old blood conflict. Yeah,

In reality, these export restrictions that China is implementing are internal, their restrictions imposed on companies in China who will now need to apply for a license to export these it DOMs also gallium and germanium are not naturally occurring material they're produced by companies in China. So I don't know what Alex is like he should. I don't know. Yeah, this was done in response to restrictions the US placed on exporting semiconductor technology to China. The story isn't a non story, and it's clearly part of a strategic resource back and forth. But it's so clear that Alex just saw a headline that called this restriction, a warning shot and he's just riffing out an elaborate story about it. And also, Alex should maybe be fine with these particular metals not being allowed because they're primarily used in things that he hates, like 5g and solar panels. And he thinks that solar panels are part of a big environmental fraud meant to cut off the tech the energy in our country, so you should be happy that we don't have those 5g is going to brainwash everyone and kill them with, with mind bullets or something. So yeah, great. Blood, we should be banning these metals. Yeah.
