''Kerry Lynn Cassidy''' (also nicknamed Sweary Kerry and sometimes incorrectly called Kerry Callahan in early episodes) is the creator and host of [[Project Camelot]], a prominent UFO / Alien / Secret Space Program conspiracy "show".

Kerry is relevant to the Knowledge Fight universe because when Dan and Jordan need a break from [[Alex Jones]], they often cover some nonsense interview from Kerry instead. Unfortunately, over time, it has become clear that some of Kerry's beliefs are [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|thinly veiled antisemitic / racist tropes]], which makes the whole thing less fun.

On a recent episode of Project Camelot, Kerry was (probably) [[698: For Squatch, There Are No Heroes|trolled by a Knowledge Fight listener pretending to know a Sasquatch]].
