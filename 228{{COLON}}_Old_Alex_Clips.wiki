Dan is in the middle of preparing the research for the forthcoming Obama Deception documentary coverage, so he needs a real novelty to really get his mind into the show today. Thus, he decides to tell Jordan about some old clips he found of Alex Jones from his public access days in the Clinton era. What the gents end up finding there is at times charming, and at times deeply troubling.
