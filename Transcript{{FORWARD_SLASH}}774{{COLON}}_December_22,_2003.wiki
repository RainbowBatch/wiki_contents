And that carries even when the thing that it's like why you can watch bad movies with friends or a crowd. Oh, really? Yeah. But I kind of have some similar feelings. I guess I'm not as negative on it as you necessarily but I have gotten a little bit less hype. Yeah. Still quite enjoyable. But I think so here's what I understand from the other day I watched a video that was explaining the storylines of past Fire Emblem sure Sure, sure. Yeah, I don't think the story is ever really that much to go on. That's fair. It's usually pretty cookie cutter kind of Kingdom prints and magic kind of truth stuff. Totally. So I think I think that is maybe thing that you had because the expectations of three houses was very story dense lis. And I think I was thinking about this. The other problem that it has this game the Engage has that is different than three houses, is that you have to recruit all of these folks. Oh, man, there's so far like engage in engage. There's so many characters so many that it becomes clogged in your lineup, and you're not using most of them most of the time. Whereas in three houses, you had to go out of your way to enlist people who weren't in your school. Yep. And you kind of took an interest in trying to figure out how am I going to convince them to fight with me totally. And there was more of like a there's more of a connection with the people whereas a lot of these characters are just kind of like, I don't know why you're here. Yeah.

Yeah, no, because you have the inbuilt party system within the three houses of your house. Yeah. So you have the instinctive need to get to know them over the other characters to start with. Yeah, right. And then once you've gotten to know them, maybe you find some people outside of your house that you like that you want in your house. You don't have to just like come win a story battle, and then some asshole shows up and you're like, now I have to deal with your menu system. I'm sick of your uh, your job is dumb. Like it's a it's a mess. Yeah, it's a mess.

    | text      = So there's a lot going on in that call. lip. Yeah, first of all, can't wait to hear from racist grandpa Paul, it's weird to think about this. But in 2003, his public image was very different than it is now. Or it deserved to be then because he had this weird appearance of being a rational voice of opposition to the war in Iraq, that did a whole lot of work masking the absurd John Birch Society as politics he actually espoused, but what I'm getting at is that he had a decent PR team back then yeah. Secondly, it's interesting that Alex will not stop saying the draft is right around the corner, which will be foisted upon us after a false flag terrorist attack. And I want to take a second to analyze the logic he's using to make that claim. He thinks Cheney needs a bigger military aid recruitment is down. Meanwhile, there are these unspecified Bill proposals or drafts that would bring back the draft. They're just waiting to go, right. Any of these things could be true or not. But even if all of them are true, it does nothing to suggest that there's an elaborate plot to pull a false flag in order to bring in the draft. I have no idea what bills he's talking about. And if they do exist, they're destined to die in committee. So I'm not even gonna take that seriously. I asked for Cheney wanting a bigger military and recruitment being down that could be the impetus for Institute in the draft. Or it could be a motivation to explore other recruitment strategies like fun CGI army commercials at movies, I will just conclusion holds no weight, it's just the option he's decided to extrapolate out of the situation he sees, because it's the one that fits his narratives and scares his extreme right wing listeners the best right? I know that there were some real insecurities about the idea of a draft coming up at this point, but it's hard to believe that this was something the government would seriously consider doing. In the late 60s and early 70s, the largely campus based anti draft protest movements were he severe impediment to this enlistment strategy. According to the University of Washington, quote, in 1972, there were more conscientious objectors than actual draftees, all major cities faced backlogs of induction refusal, legal cases. And the Selective Service later reported that 206,000 persons were reported delinquent during the entire war period. The lessons of that era are still a real today, namely that there are too many people who would refuse to show up. And the government simply can't logistically punish everyone how they would need to, in order to make the fear of punishment, a motivating factor for people not to resist a draft, yeah,

    | text      = So for a moment, put aside the reality of or falsity of what Alex is saying in terms of his narrative, it's important to recognize that what he's engaging in is only the headline of a story and not the actual content, right. This is an article that solely based on the assumptions of one person who had visited Saddam two days after his capture. He thought he looked sick and was maybe being given strong medication, but then offered no proof. This is just a guess. This person was a photographer who had accompanied Ahmad Chalabi for a meeting and there's no reason to take this as definitive or proof of anything. Sure. Saddam's daughter is also cited in the article that Alex is using as saying that her father must be being drugged, which isn't like really all that strong in terms of evidence. Sure. This is also a misrepresentation of her comments, by way of like Alex using this as defense of like, Saddam being drugged because she was saying these things, the way that she was saying that she meant to suggest that said I must have been drugged prior to his capture sure to be like going along with it right around this time. There were many rumors circulating that Saddam had been captured by local rivals as revenge drugged and then left to be found by US forces. Right. That's kind of a side thing to this article. Sure. This is about him being drugged in captivity, right right. Since this point, the doctor who treated Saddam Dr. Sood at Bose has come out and said that while he can't reveal specifics due to doctor patient confidentiality, he quotes treated him like he would any other patient. Yeah, I do think that there's some legitimate questions to ask about what kind of interrogation tactics may have been used, especially at this point when you're covering stuff considering the context of what our government allowed in the war, but Alex is completely winging it here. He has nothing to base anything on other than conjecture.

And when he does talk about the backing of it, this employment of Saddam he just says it's congressional reports, which is useless as a citation. Saddam does seem super old and all but he was born in 1937. So you would have been 17 and 1954. At the time, it makes a little sense for him to have been employed by Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as an anti communist assassin, considering that the bath party was a socialist party, and was involved with movements towards the pan Arab Republic, including countries like Egypt and Syria, right. But Saddam didn't even join the party until three years later, in 1958. The bath is supported General Abdel Karim Kasim in his overthrow of the country, but then would be involved in a plot to assassinate him just a year later, primarily due to Cassini opposition to the idea of this pan Arab Republic. And Saddam was involved in that plot of assassination, which I think is what Alex has done. Right, right. So there's no way Alex could prove the US hired Saddam to be involved in that assassination plot or even prove outside involvement. The Assassination failed, and Saddam fled the country so there's no way you would have had the power to make Shalabi flee at that point.

    | text      = So this is disturbing, because it either is evidence of Alex being an intensely malicious liar, or it reveals that he is someone with a below adolescent level of media literacy. He has an article that's covering the story that the Kurds captured Saddam, which is just reporting something that was published in the Sunday Express based on an unnamed British intelligence source, then he has an article that's from an Australian press outlet, which is also based on the same Sunday Express article, which is to say that it's all based on the same coverage of the unnamed British intelligence source, right. Alex is reporting to his audience that this Australian press article is somehow a separate piece of news, not just the same story being covered by a different outlet. That level of stupidity is actually kind of scary to see and someone who's presenting themselves as a reliable source of insight. And what makes it even more alarming is that I think this is a pretty consistent thing with Alex. I'd never thought about it this way before. But this could explain why Alex covers the same story in multiple outlets the way he does, yeah, I've always considered it to be a function of his laziness and knowing that his audience will see a bulk of headlines and assume that that means that there's there's more smoke there. So there's definitely fire. Hearing this coverage actually makes me think that Alex might think that each of these stories relies on different primary sourcing, and they're just coming out coincidentally at the same time. That is to say the UK article is written because the British press has British sources telling them this stuff, and the Australian article is being written because the Australian press concurrently has their sources saying the same thing. If Alex believes that, it would make sense why he thinks like, the picture that he's seeing is somehow far more convincing or overwhelming, and also suspicious than it is. But that belief would have to be like, it's entirely based on things he's making up in his head based on primary misunderstandings of how the media works. Or he's a liar, right? It's an interesting question, because I could see this going either way. I guess best case scenario hears that Alex is completely unqualified to explain the news to anyone based on his comically deficient understanding of what he's reading. Worst case scenario, he knows all this stuff is based on the same source, but knows that pretending otherwise would make it more convincing to his audience. So he's lying to them as a shortcut for his narratives. Not a good look. Either way.

    | timestamp = 00:47:19.000
    | text      = So this is a great illustration of why taking hypocrisy to be fundamentally meaningful is a dead end in terms of having a solid position que here's the ground Alex is trying to lay claim to. He's against the criminalization of drugs and thus wants to be seen as supporting the recreational use of things like weed or I guess, in this case, even oxy cotton. Sure, that's fine, I guess. However, some people he doesn't like who politically may disagree with decriminalization also enjoy recreational drug use, they apparently should not be free to use drugs, right because of that opposition, right, their freedom to use drugs, which Alex allegedly believes in is conditional upon them agreeing with Alex's position on drugs, which is a little weird. In essence, in order for Alex to make this coherent at all, he can't possibly want to punish them for the drug use, because that's something he ostensibly believes should be decriminalized. That means in order for this to make any sense, then Alex has to want to outlaw hypocrisy, which is criminally stupid as a political position. Or maybe, is the reality that Alex doesn't think that drugs are fine, and actually does think that people should be punished for using them. Is it possible that he just knows that advancing that position would make him look like a ridiculous person considering his libertarian public image? And how it would mean that he would be advocating for the government dictating what you can and can't enjoy for fun? Sure. Is it possible he just knows the position he's supposed to have, but actually doesn't believe in that position? It's hard to tell, given the way that he carries himself Sure. The question gets even weirder, because this hypocrisy thing is an accusation that it makes sense to direct it rush, kind of. But what does Alex even know about Al Gore's son's positions on drugs? Alex has no idea what he thinks. But apparently Alex wants to require the son to adhere to the positions of the Father, or else their actions hypocritical. That really seems fucking stupid, particularly for someone who's so invested in the idea of individuality. Alex is more or less advocating that you have an obligation to adhere to the moral set of your parents, even if you're an adult. And if you fail to do that, you should be arrested for something Alex doesn't think people should be arrested for children are they're fucking stupid. All right.

The assumption that you would be the enemy if you were outside that's not based on a quote from him. But it's an assessment made by the person who's writing the article share the article quotes cast percent is saying, quote, you literally are staying home is what happens unless you're required to be out no different than if you had a state of emergency with a snowstorm. He also didn't say that you would be a slave or all your liberties would be taken away. Yeah, the article says quote, a rattler would also tear away virtually all personal freedoms to move about and associate. This isn't Caspersen saying that it's the reporters characterization of how rattler would limit transportation and people being able to congregate right places. Yeah, kind of makes sense.

And then Alex has to get defensive. So this is about the book Civil War Two, which was written by Thomas chittum. Here's some fun facts about chittum. Let's hear him in 1998. He was a speaker at the first annual conference on racial separatism. Sure, it's also featured such racist as Jared Taylor, what will this Cardo know this founder of storm front, and associative Ron Paul, Don Black, right. He published his book was Civil War Two as a possible scenario for how race war will break down in America. If you cruise websites that discuss it, and one of the frequent comments is, it's not exactly like The Turner Diaries, which is cool. It's real cool that that's the common thing to distinguish exactly like it. Yeah. He's a committed racist, homophobe and white nationalist to put it in the most generous way possible. Also, he apparently enlisted in the Zimbabwean Civil War in the early 70s. Sure, keep in mind that he's an American who was born in New Jersey, right, he decided to enlist and fight predictably, on the side of the Rhodesian forces who were trying to maintain a brutal white supremacist apartheid stance what I was expecting, this guy is so far beyond racist. Alex knows all this. He just doesn't think the things that I've mentioned are actually racist, like,
