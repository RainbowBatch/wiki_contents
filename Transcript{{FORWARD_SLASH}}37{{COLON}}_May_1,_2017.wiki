So to give you, Tyler a little bit of an update, I want to do previously on the life and times of Alex Jones. I told you before we started recording that Alex's life is about to fall apart. And here's why. First of all, he lost his kids. He lost custody of his children last week. That's going to slowly deteriorate his mind. Additionally, Chobani yogurt has put out a lawsuit on him.

I don't know what to believe it's complete insanity. Like it could be true and he's lying about the retraction or he could have been lying and he made sincere rejection. I have no fucking idea.

But this is a video essentially, about Alex Jones being incredibly pissed off about Facebook. And then he loses the thread and starts yelling about a bunch of other stuff. I'm pretty certain he's on some sort of amphetamine, he seems beaked out of his mind. He's shooting this in his bedroom. And it's a gorgeous bedroom. It's huge. He is very rich. For now. Yeah, for now. He's going to lose that bedroom very soon. But he's he's like getting up and sitting down and like pacing around. He is he's on some sort of speed. It's crazy. Anyway, I'm gonna let him start it off. Okay, this is how he begins the report.

They're a bunch of dumb efforts. And then I see the different things they do and how Facebook acts like they're open and free, and you follow their rules. And they censored libertarian or nationalistic or patriotic messages. They target people and don't let you share your post. Even if you pay Facebook to share your post, they block them. And then they just force feed,

You got to you got a kernel there that I'm going to agree with him on. Sure. But then when he goes on, that that whole thing about like, Facebook isn't allowing us to share things. He's misrepresenting how Facebook works. Like you have a page for we still like you, right? And whenever you post something to your fanpage, you probably have like a couple 1000 fans, I would assume, or something like that. Yeah. So you have a couple 1000 fans, you post something on your fan page. And if you don't promote it, only 20 people will see it. Because they want you to pay for it to be promoted. Right? They restrict how many of your own fans see your shit. It's just how it works. It's an advertising platform, right? masquerading as a social network.

It's incredibly stupid. Right? So he's gonna say some more bad stuff about Facebook. That isn't true. But before he does that, and I have to critique him. I do think Facebook is bad Facebook, it turns us all into monsters. Yeah. You spout like bullshit opinions. Often it's trite shit that people are posting Yeah, the whole idea of virtue signaling that the alt right likes to throw around the idea of like, you don't really believe the principles you post online.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 14:58
    | text      = We'll get back to that. Oh, But we'll get back to that. That's his first example of what a trend is. But you know what he's talking about there with Facebook? No, not really. So a report came out recently, a couple days ago about Facebook being caught sort of targeting people that they viewed as sort of weak and more impressionable, more vulnerable people. Okay. Alex is saying, and his argument that he's going to lay out is that they were doing this in order to make them liberals. They're recruiting liberals, basically, they're finding vulnerable people on Facebook. The truth is, at worst, it's an advertising strategy. It's much like putting sugary cereal commercials during cartoons, and stuff like that, or shady toy commercials during cartoons. Yeah, you're targeting youth, basically. So he's gonna make it seem really evil. But I hear here's what this actually was. The company Facebook said claims made about targeting site users were quote, misleading, but has since issued an apology and said that investigation would be launched into the matter. In the statement, Facebook said, quote, the analysis done by an Australian researcher was intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads, and was based on data that was anonymous and aggregated. I believe that but I also don't believe them, that it wasn't for marketing. You know what I mean? Right? It's all for marketing. It absolutely is. Why would they be helping marketers understand how people express themselves if it wasn't for marketing? Yeah, that's insane. So that part, I believe them? And I don't believe them. And I don't believe Alex. Now, he also said that they targeted 700,000 users. Now, this is unfortunate, because that's a specific stat that I can trace that has nothing to do with this. That has to do with Facebook, what they did in 2012. Do you remember that?

The 700,000 users was when they were trying to see if they could sway people's moods by posting positive or negative stories on people's walls. Oh, is that a true thing? Yeah, in 2012, they did this weird study without people's permission, where they would post based on key words, they could determine were positive or negative, they would take people and they would post primarily negative things on their wall and see what things they would post to see if it would affect their mood. Now, the research was done. And it technically isn't illegal. It's fucked up. It's technically not illegal. And it was done and published in like research journal. So it was legit. They were doing it for theoretical scientific reasons. Yeah, that's still really fucked up. That has nothing to do with this. Alex is just an idiot and everything Facebook does is all one big. It's one big conspiracy. Yeah. So anyway, back to back to what trendies are.

Muslims becoming radicalized and wanting to sexually mutilate women, or throw gays off buildings that is an orthodoxy a system of oppression. And that's what trendies are. They believe they're the cultural avant garde, and that they're the coolest people out there. Because they seek what is conformist they believe, to be in the in crowd. Well, the system then puts out a plastic artificial in crowd I've talked about this forever, that Wall Street and Madison Avenue that Hollywood has talked about for 67 years, Edward Bernays created Hollywood or helped Hollywood form to merge government officials with media to make the Hollywood stars and to make the political stars. And that's what things like the White House Correspondents Dinner, are really all about, is getting politicians with Hollywood and the media and making it like they're the upper class. They're the beautiful people and you're a nobody. And then once you feel like you're not part of the in class, they're up on a Mount Olympus, like the Greek gods, or demigods in their golden fields of Elysium and you just don't think you can attain it. That's recent government buildings always been huge and ornate and stately and powerful is to project this is unstoppable.
