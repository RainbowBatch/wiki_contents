The phrase "'''New World Order'''" is often misused and misrepresented by conspiracy theorists and far-right groups, who claim that it refers to a secretive, [[Globalists|globalist]] agenda aimed at creating a one-world government or totalitarian state. In reality, the phrase has been used in various contexts throughout history, including by political leaders, academics, and international organizations, to refer to a broad range of ideas and initiatives related to global governance, cooperation, and development.
