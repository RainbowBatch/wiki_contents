Today, Dan and Jordan's exploration of Alex Jones' increasingly amateurish and embarrassing "documentary" [[Endgame]] continues. On this episode, the gents follow Alex to Canada where he yells at strangers with a megaphone, and they learn about how important it is, when you're making outrageous accusations, to have not-insane people be your source.
