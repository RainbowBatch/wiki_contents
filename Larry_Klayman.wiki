'''Larry Klayman''' is a lawyer, far-right activist, and InfoWars guest. The SPLC describes him as "a pathologically litigious attorney and professional gadfly notorious for suing everyone from Iranâ€™s Supreme Leader to his own mother"<ref>https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/larry-klayman</ref>.

Klayman was recently disbarred for several months after harrasing a client who rejected his romantic advances<ref>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/dc-circuit-suspends-attorney-klayman-as-reciprocal-discipline</ref>. As you may be able to guess, this is only the most recent in a long line of ethics complaints against him<ref>https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/10/28/16-72275.pdf</ref>.

Klayman was initially most notable to Knowledge Fight listeners for his role as [[Joe Arpaio]]'s lawyer (and to a lesser extent as [[Jerome Corsi]]'s lawyer). In [[401: Formulaic Objections Part 3]], however, covered a contentious deposition between Klayman and [[Roger Stone]], leading to Klayman's inclusion in [[List of Sound Drops|commonly played sound drops]].

Other weirdos represented by or closely associated with Klayman include:

*[[Dennis Montgomery]]
*[[Laura Loomer]]
*[[Cliven Bundy]]
*[[Joseph Farah]]
*[[Roy Moore]]
*[[George Zimmerman]]
*A bunch of super racist cops<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/news/philly-police-plainview-project-racism-facebook-firing-klayman-krasner-ross-outlaw-20200722.html</ref>
