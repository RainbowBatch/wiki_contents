And Luke Harper, the other guy who was in his Wyatt family has now passed away. Oh, shit. Yeah. And so it would be kind of tough to recapture some of what the Wyatt Family was. Yeah, I think it wouldn't be worth going back to that. But I also think going back to the fiend thing might be a mistake at this point, too. So I'm glad that he had his mask off, right, and so like it's not, I don't think it's gonna be horror super villainy thing but rent. I'm so excited to see him back. I don't even watch wrestling that much. And I'm very excited for him. Yes, he's he's a he's an there's something about that Bray Wyatt fella.

Wow, mainstream news everywhere that billionaires are already moving into their bunkers, or have already moved into their bunkers in the southern hemisphere. Again, I've had in depth discussions with not one, not two, but three, well known billionaires, about when do they think they should relocate to the southern hemisphere? Is that a good idea? And I said, Absolutely. They said, Well, are you going to relocate? And I said, I don't have all this money. The media says, I do know, I have a trailer my parents paid for on their ranch. That's been our family since the 1820s. And I love it. It's beautiful. It's over the lake and everything else. And we'll just go there and probably die during all this. But that's just how it works.

But it's a fun way for Alex to weave in a little complaint about how the courts think he has more money than he does. There's a kernel of truth to the story that Alex was telling about the US government buying a bunch of pills that treat radiation poisoning, but he's just way off. And he's telling the story wrong. This is about a recent $290 million purchase of a drug called Nplate. It's not potassium iodide, as Alex will go on to say and such. But Alex isn't really a details guy. So yeah, this is not the first time that the government administration for strategic preparedness and response has purchased such medication. But it is the first time with Nplate mostly because he was only approved for this purpose in 2021. This is the end result of financing that the HHS began in 2019 on this drug, and it serves a purpose in the Strategic National Stockpile. But it apparently isn't that great of a drug to respond to nuclear attacks, predominantly because it needs to be used fairly quickly after exposure to be effective. Right. So if like a city was nuked, this wouldn't really be that useful. No, this is more like it would be too difficult,

The article quotes a Facebook post as saying that she had a brief illness, so it's probably not something that was chronic. And on her memorial page, there's a link where you can donate to a meningitis research organization. This doesn't mean that she contracted a severe case of meningitis.

The Russians entire ethos is about being invaded by the Mongols and the Huns and the Muslims and Napoleon and Hitler. Russia didn't start invading places until the Communists took it over.

Yeah, it's pretty wild for people to be doing that since Putin's government passed a law back in March where they could imprison people for up to 15 years for criticizing the military. The only person in that article that Alex is citing who is calling for nuclear weapons to be used is Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who's a hardline Putin loyalist. He's such a Putin loyalists that he's trying to scapegoat the some other people in the Kremlin to defend Putin from criticisms about how things are going in Ukraine. Yeah, another small point, the headline of the article that Alex is using as quote, Russian elite voice growing anger as losses mount in Ukraine, Alex added, demanding Putin do more from his own imagination. Yeah, that is not in the text nor the article. I don't know who would end up in power if Putin were removed, mostly because almost all relevant political opposition in the country has been crushed or imprisoned. And Putin has essentially been in power for 22 years. So it's hard to predict who would descend? Yeah, no matter who it would be. It does not matter. It does not mean that like Putin is not a moderate. Who would come to power not leave that aside. Yeah. ridiculous to say Putin to moderate No, that's just another rationalization for Alex to use to justify his very obvious support for Putin, despite a bunch of stuff happening in the world that makes that support look really bad, right?

For one thing, he doesn't have enough content to justify the amount of time he's on air as is and there's no reason to add like six hours a week so that pile. Second, he claims that he's just gonna take calls but that's bullshit. Alex can't stay on task to save his life. So this is going to end up being more rants and begging people for money at the beginning of this show. He said the first and second hours open phones. He gets two calls an hour and 20 minutes into the show. So close. So close. And you know, this is there's a third point to this. And this seems desperate. Yeah, there's no reason to do this show other than to try to make more money. There's no great demand for it. There's no way Alex needs more time to cover the news. What this boils down to is that no one else at Infowars can sell for shit. Oh, and and Harrison's shows clearly aren't bringing in the sales. So Alex feels like he needs to be on air essentially all the time to keep the infomercial going. If that weren't a major factor in this idea, he could easily have someone else host a show. That's mostly callers. Oh, wait, that was the premise of Harrison Smith show before he started getting a bunch of callers that were like, Hey, why won't Alex just say it to the Jew?

But it's primitive technology is programmed in most areas for the flow. Some areas it's not synchronized. But I said it's primitive technology. But humans submit to it. And humans go along with the stoplights. The red lights, the yellow lights, the green lights, the turn signals that yield signs, because they know it makes their life better.

    | text      = So I guess Alex has been on the USS Enterprise before. That must have been fun. That was fun. Yeah. Beyond that. You can see here how much of a charge Alex gets out of negative attention. That's just such a powerful fuel for him because he's internalized the fallacious idea that consequences and negative attention are the signs of a virtuous person. He's up against this cosmic overpowered evil. So the fact that Alex is facing a giant defamation judgment can only be evidence of how good he is. If he were an evil person, that cosmic overpowered evil forces would protect him from such a thing. But because he's a threat to the devil, he's subjected to the slings and arrows, Shakespeare nice. This is a really dangerous and stupid mindset to have. Because if you think this way, and you're like, I don't know, let's say you're a narcissist, you'll never be able to accept any criticism. Every time someone tells you that you fucked up every time that you get in trouble for something really bad that you did, you'll find a way to convince yourself that the consequences or criticism is just motivated by evil trying to get you off course from your holy mission. Your ability to self assess is completely erased by this mindset replaced by an ability to rationalize any really hurtful or destructive things you do. Alex is afraid to wrestle with the actual impact that he has on the world because on some level, probably or even pilot, possibly subconscious. He knows that that would be the end of his career. His ideology and worldview don't hold up to any actual scrutiny. So his ability to hide behind being a champion for that ideology and worldview would likewise crumble if examined critically, if all consequences are just proof that you're on the right track, then whoever may have been hurt along the way, they're just the unfortunate collateral damage of the war against the globalists. But if these consequences aren't proof that you're on the right track, and they're just people you've hurt, there's no excuse for it. You just don't care how many people's lives you ruined in order to make sure that you're rich and sound interesting on your radio show. That's really the sort of real world version of this.
