'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Myung_Moon Sun Myung Moon]''' (Korean: 문선명; Hanja: 文鮮明; born '''Yong Myung Moon'''; 6 January 1920 - 3 September 2012) was a Korean religious leader, businessman, and conservative benefactor.  He is perhaps most well known for his claims that he was the Messiah.  He founded the Unification movement (members of which considered him and his wife Hak Ja Han to be their "True Parents").  The Unification movement received coverage for the "Blessing" or mass wedding ceremonies.  Members of the movement were called "Moonies".

Moon was born in modern-day North Korea.  He was raised as a Christian.  After the division of the peninsula, he was convicted for spying for South Korea and sent to a North Korean labor camp.  He was freed by the UN and US troops during the Korean War.

He was an anti-communist and an advocate for Korean reunification.  He founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity in Seoul, South Korea, based on conservative, family-oriented teachings and new interpretations of the Bible. In 1971, he moved to the United States and became well known after giving a series of public speeches on his beliefs.

Moon is also criticized for his relationships with political figures, including US presidents Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, North Korean president Kim Il-sung, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
