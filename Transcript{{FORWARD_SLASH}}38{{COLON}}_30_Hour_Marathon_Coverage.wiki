They started during Alex Jones's show on Wednesday, starts at 11 o'clock Central. And they went through I believe, eight o'clock, eight or nine o'clock on Thursday, eight o'clock pm on Thursday. Whoa, but here's the thing. It's kind of bullshit. What? Yeah, because Alex Jones wasn't manning a lot of it. So you have like him doing his own show? And then periodically they drop him special reports with him which are just pre taped shit. Yeah. So he's not losing his mind at three in the morning. We're not what we want. Yeah,

But he did adhere to the Oh, fuck, let's try and pimp products as hard as we can. Good every hour, they played a 10 minute thing of him just it was just Alex at the desk pre taped. Like I like to have a lot of fun on the show. We like to joke around something that's not funny. Is the globalists.

Rebel media up in Canada, it's a Canadian companies, they're, they're influencing our politics as a foreign company. That's very weird. And it's okay. I don't know. It's very murky because the people in the rebel media, the southern Baked Alaska, the he's Christ, they are getting paid by some organization, whether it be rebel media or some other organization to counter protest in Berkeley.

And when I did that, to him, using unnamed people to make up that I didn't want Trump to be elected, that I didn't want Obama to be defeated in 2012. And that my voice is fake. And then I told the producers that I want to sound gruffer. No, I believe my voice is grating and annoying at times. And I said, I want to sound smoother, and like I'm in the room. And I've had engineers here doing that with my engineers and it's all on record. So that's the level of lies in here that I have a fake and that I'm trying to rush limbaugh before he went deaf.

Let me read a description again from Breitbart of what happened in 2008. The companies were taken over by the US government in 2008, when officials feared their collapse could further destabilize the housing and financial markets. Treasury provided hundreds of billions of dollars of funding while the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA became their conservator. Under their original agreement with the US Treasury both companies were supposed to pay a dividend equal to 10% of their taxpayer funding, as well as a fee on the hundreds of billions more, the Treasury had pledged to support them right free interests for years. However, neither company earned enough to pay the dividend which forced them to draw even more from their bailout funds just to send the money back to Treasury as the dividend. This circular draw, as it came to be called threatened to be threatened to put the companies into a death spiral, slowly eating away at the remainder of the Treasury backstop. In mid 2012. Treasury and the FHFA agreed to change the terms of the bailout so that Fannie and Freddie would no longer have a fixed dividend, ending the need for circular draws. Instead, each company would have a flexible dividend obligation that would rise and fall with their profits. Because the new dividend is equal to the positive net worth of each company, less a small capital cushion set to decline each year. It's known as quote the net worth sweep. At the time the net worth sweep was implemented. Treasury Department officials noted that in addition to ending the circular drawers and death spiral, the arrangement would facilitate the eventual wind down of the companies by preventing them from using profits to recapitalize as policy makers designed to safe more stable mortgage finance system.

We're in a situation where Fannie and Freddie give the fucking government billions of dollars rent to a hundreds of billions of dollars a year out of their profits in order to sustain themselves based on the bailout that was made in 2008.

He said to those banks Jerome Corsi said those things right now let me explain that to you. Again, I read this paragraph a little bit ago on Breitbart in mid 2012. Treasury and the FHFA agreed to change the terms of the bailout so that Fannie and Freddie would no longer have a fixed dividend, ending the need for circular draws. Instead, each company would have a flexible dividend obligation that would rise and fall with their profits. Because the new dividend is equal to the positive net worth of each company, less, less a capital cushion set to decline each year. It is known as the net worth sweep. The net worth sweep is sweeping up part of their net worth based on how much they make each year. It's not it's not anything nefarious, it's in order to make sure that these companies don't end up destroyed by their repayment to the government. Right.

But if you actually look at the quote that they use, was not a quote, they just misquoted the old episode. And then further, they didn't actually watch the new episode, because this is from one of the human sexuality episode of Bill Nye saves the world. His new set new Netflix special science is the process by which we understand nature by which we understand our place in the world, how we all fit in, we used to think it was pretty straightforward, X and Y chromosome for males, two x's for females, but we see more combinations than that in the real life. And even for people with just two sex chromosomes. hormones can vary widely. So can anatomy. That's what makes someone male or female is not so clear cut. So even in his new episode, he's discussing how science has progressed since the nine right and giving you the scientific explanation for why, like, even when I was in high school, I understood that there were people sometimes who have three crumbs,

And your past belief invalidates your current belief or a flip flopper of the highest order. Exactly. Whereas if you are, if you are just a physicist, right, then you say force equals mass times acceleration. And that's true, but it's true most of the time, right? And then Einstein came around, and he said, equals MC squared, which is a very, it's a, it's a kind of condensation of that same formula. It doesn't invalidate the prior force equals mass times acceleration adds to it adds to it. Yeah. So it is not that I don't think that that prior stuff applies. It's that now it is more specific. And now it is more accurate. And that is what science is, it's striving for more accurate, not striving for changing its mind back and forth on this and this and this, it's that within the available information we have, this is our best summation.
