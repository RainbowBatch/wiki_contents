    | text      = But so today, the reason that we can make up a lot of time is like these shows sucked. These were nothing shows. And one of the reasons is because at this point in 2009, Alex has been featured in an IFC documentary called The New World Order. right. And it's premiering ostensibly at South by Southwest. And in March, middle March 2009,it's South by Southwest time. So he's galavanting around with the filmmakers, having the filmmakers come into studio and they're just bragging about this documentary.

I would also say I haven't seen that documentary. But the main people who are in it are Alex Jones, Jack McLamb, Holocaust denier Jack McLamb. And Big Jim Tucker, who writes for The Spotlight, which is a neo Nazi publication.

So Alex is spending a whole lot of his time with that, also promoting The Obama Deception like crazy and so we're able to skip through a good amount of this shit without going over it. Now let it be known, I still had to listen to all of it.

I am not doing an episode about Alex bragging about a documentary. I'm just not doing it. Especially not in the world we're living in in 2018. That would be the most toothless, stupid fucking thing in the world. yeah. I learned an important lesson.

    | timestamp = 00:05:45.000
    | text      = That too. okay. That's second lesson. okay, okay. The first lesson is you have to persevere. You have to keep pushing forward, even when it looks like nothing is going right. When it looks like you're gonna end up with a deadline when Jordan's gonna show up at your house and all you've got are clips of Alex being like, I'm at South by Southwest with a bullhorn having fun with some filmmakers. Oh my god, what have I got? I've got Richard Linklater's associate producer in studio talking about the globalists. I don't want to do that. But you keep pushing forward, and you're gonna strike pay dirt. And I did. I felt like

    | text      = You don't understand that like six hours before you get here, I have to know what we're doing. yeah. Because otherwise, what are we doing? yeah. So but look, I hit pay dirt and I'm glad I did. I think I found something incredibly huge that will re context recontextualize almost everything about Alex Jones in 2009. And it's the product of keeping pushing forward when the going is done. okay, all right. Now, that being said,

So here's one from March 15th where Alex tries to get back to his story about how that chimp who tore a lady's face off was on was on Prozac drugs.

Yeah, so it's kind of just like all star fuckery a little bit and then Jason Burmis being boring as hell. So the 16th we can wipe it completely off our plate, okay, we don't have to worry about the 16th at all. Now, I should also say that the 17th is also trash. On the 17th, that's when Alex just has the IFC producers in studio and interviews them about how great their documentary about him. So it's like, uh unh. No.

And then Alex at the end of the show has his one of his vaccine experts, Barbara Loe Fisher on the show, to talk about how bad vaccines are. We've already talked about Barbara so we don't need to really dive too deep into her nuttiness. But it bears repeating that this is one of their big arguments. This is one of the arguments that one of Alex Jones's vaccine experts is making, and it's a bad sign.

The argument is, you don't have the right as an individual parent to make that choice for your child. Because if you don't make the choices the government says you need to make, in this case get get vaccinated, you put your neighbor's child at risk. I've always said, if the vaccines are as effective as the companies and have said they are, then you should have, then the vaccinated should have nothing to fear from those who choose not to get vaccinated.

That's terrible, man, if your vaccine expert is coming at you with the argument that, hey, if everybody is vaccinated, they shouldn't have anything to fear for people not being vaccinated. yeah, that makes sense. You haven't done cursory research about how a lot of people can't get vaccinated. dohhh. Cuz of allergies, or underlying conditions that they may have. All of these things lead to you not being able to be vaccinated. So like, the idea isn't just that, like, it's not like I have vaccines so I'm afraid of you not having vaccines. It's a public health situation, because there's a large segment of the population who just can't get vaccinated and want to.

There is no mention of Ron Paul bumper stickers at all in here. The mention of Ron Paul is, these members are usually supporters of former presidential candidate Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin and Bob Barr. The next paragraph talks about anti government propaganda. Militia members commonly display picture cartoon bumper stickers that contain anti government rhetoric. Most of this will depict the FRS, IRS, FBI, ATF, CIA, UN, law enforcement and the New World Order in a derogatory manner. It's completely different sections of this report that characterizes militias and these dangerous groups that are not just liberty lovers.

    | timestamp = 00:31:41.000
    | text      = So he's going to read that bill. He doesn't. Also Alex is completely misrepresenting this bill, because of course, he is. From a write up on FactCheck. The initial version of the bill that was introduced in the House quote, called for a congressional commission to address and analyze several topics, including issues that deter volunteerism and how they can be overcome. How expanding international public service might affect diplomacy and foreign relations. And whether a workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed, and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the nation. However, the version that passed the House had this language completely stripped from it. The version that passed the Senate never included such language at all. Even Orrin Hatch said, on the, on the Senate floor, quote, consistent with our all volunteer army and volunteer opportunities and individuals choice and communities, nothing in this legislation is mandatory. Because Alex is saying that the bill passed and not that the bill was introduced, it's very clear that he's lying, or that the only thing he knows about the bill is based on the article on his site written by Paul Joseph Watson, who was way too sloppy to know that a bill can be rewritten in committee or any other place in debates. So the bill that's introduced is not always the same as the bill that's voted on. It's pretty clear this is just another example of Paul Joseph Watson having zero professionalism as a journalist and reporting some something completely inaccurate because it fits Infowars predetermined narrative.

They knew in advance that the Chehaw tribe were a friendly group and not the ones who did what they're mad at, but decided to take out their anger on them anyway. If you go back in time, you'll find tons and tons of examples of exactly this racially motivated violence done by militia groups, but that's going too far back.

He's Stewart Rhodes, created a great website. He's a constitutional lawyer. But masses of military and police have been saying they pledged to be Oath Keepers and not violate the bill of rights, constitution and follow their oath. And it it's when I read it I said this person has a deep knowledge of what's going on because this is how I would have written probably better than I would have written it.

So thank you for your service. In 2008, Rhodes would go on to be a volunteer for Ron Paul's campaign for President. In his advocacy, one of the things that really seems to have stuck out for him was how unfair it was for people to associate Ron Paul with things like racism and Right wing extremists. Far be it from us to remind everyone of the attempted takeover of Dominica and of course, Ron Paul's racist newsletter that had his name on it and was written in the first person. After the failure of Ron Paul to become president, Rhodes decided to change approach. Noticing, noticing the rising tide of the early Tea Party movement, Rhodes established the Oath Keepers, based on the 10

So it does bear mentioning that a couple days before where we're covering now, Jack McLamb, noted Holocaust denier Jack McLamb, came on Alex Jones's show and read those 10 orders that the Oath Keepers will not follow. So there's already been sort of a priming of the audience to the idea that these Oath Keepers, these young kids on the scene, they're pretty cool. They're pretty cool. And I'm guessing that Jack McLamb, behind the scenes, connected Alex with Stewart Rhodes. seems like it. And bada bing, here we go. So Alex wants to ask Stewart, how'd this all start?

Of course, he was attempting to tie Darren Huff's arrest in with the Montgomery information. Leaving aside that the Dennis Montgomery information is complete bullshit, Huff was under surveillance because he told a bank teller that he was going to take over Madisonville and the bank teller called the authorities.

Alex uses that report still, for years after this.

A very good strategy to ensure that the Overton window has shifted in the direction you want it to, is to offer two options that both head in that direction, one mild and one extreme. The two sides probably don't even have to like each other. The mild side says the extreme is childish and not serious. The extreme side says they're the true movement and the mild side is controlled opposition.

    | text      = In such a climate, you guarantee that more people will sign up with the mild side, but the very nature of their overlapping rhetorics will tend toward a shift heading in the direction towards the extreme. The people will join with the mild and ultimately find it unsatisfying, and head for the more extreme stuff. Once they start becoming acclimated to the extreme side, they'll find the answer as to why they weren't satisfied by the mild side: because it was controlled opposition all along. Because the thing is, the pipe doesn't go the other direction. In this example, Glenn Beck doesn't ever de-escalate things. No one gets free of Alex Jones's propaganda by becoming a Glenn Beck fan. No one deprograms from the Oath Keepers by falling in love with the peaceful anti-tech, sign holding demonstrators, and realizes that civic action is the best way to affect changes that they want to see in society. The slide goes downward, and every convert to the Tea Party is one more likely patriot movement recruit in waiting. I'm not proposing that this was an elaborate plan or intentional. That would be absurd, conspiratorial thinking, but I am suggesting that looking back on this, there could be no worse setup for the maintenance of a healthy body politic. Once the GOP started embracing the Tea Party, they were possibly knowingly or possibly unwittingly embracing not only the extreme side, they were also embracing the mild side that really only ever existed to be a conduit to the extreme side.

So then center left is actually turned into center right and center right has turned into crazy right. And crazy right has turned into the violent militia group. right. And all all the while progressives are over here, like, why is everybody ignoring us? We're all getting fucked. And the center right, which was the center left begins to insist that the only way to win elections is to be center right.

This is his way to get in on the act that he sees Glenn Beck being very successful with, without having to feel like he's sold out. And I think that will carry through, throughout, even when he starts associating more with the Tea Party, he can carry this torch of, I'm the real version of it.

So we have this MIAC Report, I think, with Alex Jones bringing on that cop or playing that audio of the cop very clearly explaining what the MIAC report is about, and it not making a dent in the propaganda armor. We see the hopelessness of engaging with folks like this. Or at least with people like Alex. You see the hopelessness and the intentional propaganda that's going on, as opposed to it just being a misunderstanding. In addition to that you see here, the introduction of the Oath Keepers. And what you're going to end up seeing, and this, this puts into perfect context, why on the last episode, when I told you I went back, and I listened to the time around when that guy got caught with a napalm bomb in his house, who was the head of the Cleveland chapter of the Oath Keepers.
