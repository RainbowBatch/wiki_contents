The people getting bombed sent to them would be terrible anytime. Yep. It's it's hard to deal with. And I don't. I don't. I feel for everyone in the world. Yes, to experience all this stuff. Yep. But this is a show where I know a lot about Alex Jones and I don't know anything about Alex. That is correct. And before we get into today's show, I'd like to give a shout out to good buddy Kevin Hogan went out with him on the other night went over to bud Long's delicious Nashville hot chicken delicious.

    | text      = But so today, the reason that we can make up a lot of time is like these shows sucked. These were nothing shows. And one of the reasons is because at this point in 2009. Alex has been featured in an IFC documentary called The New World Order, right. And it's premiering ostensibly at South by Southwest. And in March, middle March 2009. It's South by Southwest time. So he's galavanting around with the filmmakers having the filmmakers come into studio and they're just bragging about this documentary. Right, right.

We just wanted to give you a glimpse into the people who believe this their lives. Yeah, right. Yeah. So whatever. I would also say I haven't seen that documentary. But the main people who are in it are Alex Jones, Jacques McLamb, Holocaust denier. And Big Jim Tucker, who writes for the spotlight, which is a neo Nazi problematic publication. So unless they get into some of that stuff, I don't want to see the documentary. I think you have only scraped the surface of these dudes if you if you don't. So Alex is spending a whole lot of his time with that also promoting the Obama deception like crazy and so we're able to skip through a good amount of this shit without going over it. Now let it be known. I still had to listen to all. So oh damn, this still represents a good 15 hours of my time or something like that. It was just for nothing. Just listen to Alex brag about the

When it looks like you're gonna end up with a deadline with Jordans gonna show up at your house. And all you've got are clips of Alex being like, I've been to South by Southwest with a bullhorn to filmmakers. Oh my god, what have I got? I've got Richard Linklaters associate producer in studio talking about the globalist I don't want to do that. But you keep pushing forward, and you're gonna strike pay dirt. And I did.

Yeah, so it's kind of just like all star fuckery a little bit and then Jason Burma's being boring as hell. So the 16th we can wipe it completely off our plate, okay, we don't have to worry about the 16th at all. Now, I should also say that To the 17th is also trashed on the 17th. That's when Alex just has the IFC producers in studio and interviews them about how great their documentary about him.

And then Alex at the end of the show has his one of his vaccine experts, Barbara loe Fisher on the show, to talk about how bad vaccines are, we've already talked about Barbara. So we don't need to really dive too deep into her nuttiness. But it bears repeating that this is one of their big arguments. This is one of the arguments that one of Alex Jones is a vaccine experts is making, it's a bad sign.

The argument is you don't have the right as an individual parent to make that choice for your child. Because if you don't make the choices, the government says you need to make in this case, get get vaccinated, you put your neighbor's child at risk. I've always said if the vaccines are as effective as the companies and have said they are then you should have then the vaccinated should have nothing to fear from those who choose.

Yeah, that makes sense. You haven't done cursory research about how a lot of people can't get vaccinated, oh, allergy, on underlying conditions that they may have all of these things bleed to you not being able to be vaccinated. So like, the idea isn't just that, like, it's not like I have vaccines. So I'm afraid of you not having vaccines.

Because it's a tacit admission that he knows that Fox, his audience is way bigger than him. He's willing to do shit like this. He went on RT on inauguration day and just left his show.

And what's interesting is on this episode, march 18, Alex purports to have evidence of that, like this, some guy called the Missouri Police and recorded it, and it's some sort of a damning thing for Alex. So he's teasing that he's gonna play this audio of a guy talking to the Missouri Police. And I'm like, I don't, I can't imagine that'll be damning. Like I don't.

And whether a workable fair and reasonable mandatory service requirements for all able young people could be developed, and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the nation. However, the version that passed the House had this language completely stripped from it. The version that passed the Senate never included such language at all. Even Orrin Hatch said on the on the Senate floor quote, consistent with our all volunteer army and volunteer opportunities and individuals choice and communities. Nothing in this legislation is mandatory. Because Alex is saying that the bill passed and not that the bill was introduced, it's very clear that he's lying, or that the only thing he knows about the bill is based on the article on his site written by Paul Joseph Watson, who was way too sloppy to know that a bill can be rewritten in committee or any other place in debates.

Like it's it's he's trying to pretend that they aren't the same thing. And then as to his claim that, you know, violent militias don't exist. I'd like to take you back to 1818 when Georgia militia been slaughtered members of the peaceful Jihad tribe in retaliation for things that were done by other tribes. They knew in advance that the jihad tribe were a friendly group and not the ones who did what they're mad at, but decided to take out their anger on them. Anyway. If you go back in time, you'll find tons and tons of examples of exactly this racially motivated violence done by militia groups, but that's going too far back. So let's just mention the Bundy ranch the Malheur wildlife standoff the Oklahoma City bombing flag the unite the right rally in Charlottesville. And then there's the countless disrupted plots of militia members trying to bomb loss all false flags or take over army bases. And then there was fear the militia of noncommissioned servicemen who plan to poison an apple field and blow up a dam. As part of their plan to take over Fort Stewart in Georgia. Their plot was uncovered so in retribution, they killed a 19 year old named Michael Rourke and his 17 year old girlfriend Tiffany York and through their bodies in a lake because they thought Roark had snitched. And then of course, there's everything that the Oathkeepers have ever done. But that's a matter for another time. There's tons and tons of militia violence even in present day dating back to 1818. The history of militias have largely been pretending to be there to stand up in case and then they're laying there people getting bored and killing people and generally causing trouble.

So he got disbarred in that. Oh, okay. Okay. Not like the not the states that he's actually passed the bar. And so like he is he is, uh, you know, he has a law degree. He is he's not like, he's not an idiot. I think he's a sociopath. For sure. Yeah. But we'll get into a little bit more about the Oathkeepers. And why this is a major problem, and why it is a parallel to the present day in a very bad way. Even more so than what we talked about on the last episode. Jesus, I didn't know when we were going over that stuff on the last episode, that literally right around the corner was going to be the founder of the Oathkeepers. About a month into the Oathkeepers. Existing coming on Alex's show, and the two of them getting along like best friends, of course. So it does bear mentioning that a couple days before where we're covering now. Jack McLamb, noted. Holocaust denier, Jack McLamb came on Alex Jones's show and read those 10 orders that the Oathkeepers will not follow. So there's already been sort of a priming of the audience to the idea that these Oathkeepers these young kids on the scene, they're pretty cool. They're pretty cool. And I'm guessing that Jack McLamb, behind the scenes connected Alex with Stuart row seems like it and Bada bing, here we go. So Alex wants to ask Stuart, how this little start, how this get going?

As all the legal trouble mounted and these things came to light Stewart Rhodes attempted to distance himself in the Oathkeepers from Charles Dyer. He claimed the Dyer hadn't paid the $30 membership fee so he wasn't really an Oathkeeper. Despite the fact that there is no fee to become a member of the group. Rhodes didn't rise. He didn't want to own Dyer as one of his own members, which is really difficult to square with the reality. Because video is produced by Oathkeepers list. Charles Dyer is the group's quote official liaison to the Marines.

We talked about this on the last episode, so there's no need to dwell on this one too much. There's one interesting note to make here, though, about how these groups are too cowardly to own their own filth. On March 28 2017, Jerome Corsi got on the Alex Jones Show and told Alex that Darren Huff's arrest was the result of the same illegal surveillance that had been revealed by Joe Arpaio and Mike Zullo, thanks to their super Snowden whistleblower, Dennis Montgomery. Of course, he was attempting to tie Darren Huff's arrest and with the Montgomery information, leaving aside that the Dennis Montgomery information is complete bullshit. Huff was under surveillance because he told the bank teller that he was going to take over Madisonville and the bank teller called the authorities.

And then when they get back, they're like, Well, what just happened here, this plan isn't and then we give them more deer and we just do this, we just do a sleight of hand like with a baby and a cookie just like oh, the cookies over here, all the cookies over here.

And then two step forward that everybody loves Florida and same thing with the Alamo. In 1836. The enemy man I bet about Google this, it's already out here. It's gonna say don't sign up for this.

Speaking out involves we are the majority we have to shatter, which is why most of them are not the majority. And we have to get past the mind game of fear. And so I think it's a great idea whether it's anonymous, you write letters and post things or other people should start other Oathkeeper sides, more groups, lots of people, but it's good in my experience, just to go past the point of no return. And to commit, we're only saying we'll follow our oath.

    | text      = So he didn't expect the, the not even really nationally relevant Oathkeepers to show up, and that be the way that Alex? So here's what I believe this is the theory. Yeah, I believe that. This marks the beginning of Alex Jones getting involved with the Tea Party, though it isn't the Tea Party proper. It is the Oathkeepers. And they factor heavily into the story that remains to be told about the deterioration of politics that happens in 2009 and onwards. A very good strategy to definitely had nothing to do with a black president. Oh, no, ignore that coincidence? Yeah, a very good strategy to ensure that the Overton window has shifted in the direction you want it to, is to offer two options that both head in that direction, one mild and one extreme, the two sides probably don't even have to like each other. The mild side says the extreme is childish and not serious. The extreme side says they're the true movement and the mild side is controlled opposition to the alright and nothing in such a climate you guarantee that more people will sign up with the mild side, but the very nature of their overlapping rhetorics will tend toward a shift heading in the direction towards the extreme. The people will join with the mild and ultimately find it unsatisfying, and head for the more extreme stuff. Once they start becoming acclimated to the extreme side, they'll find the answer as to why they weren't satisfied by the mild side because it was controlled opposition all along. Because the thing is, the pipe doesn't go the other direction. In this example, Glenn Beck doesn't ever de escalate things. No one gets free of Alex Jones is propaganda by becoming a Glenn Beck fan. No one deprogrammed from the Oathkeepers by falling in love with the peaceful anti tech sign holding demonstrators and realizes that civic action is the best way to affect changes that they want to see in society. The slide goes downward, and every convert to the Tea Party is one more likely patriot movement recruit in waiting. I'm not proposing that this was an elaborate plan or intentional, that would be absurd, conspiratorial thinking, but I am suggesting that looking back on this, there could be no worst setup for the maintenance of a healthy body politic. Once the GOP started embracing the Tea Party, they were possibly knowingly or possibly unwittingly embracing not only the extreme side, they're also embracing the mild side that really only ever existed to be a conduit to the extreme side.

And in response to that the center right went as far right as it possibly could. Yeah, and the extreme side of that is gone even farther. So then center left is actually turned into center right and center right has turned into crazy right? And crazy right has turned into the violent militia group, right? And all all the why progressives are over here, like, why is everybody ignoring us? We're all getting fucked. And the center right, which was the center left begins to insist that the only way to win elections is to be center, right?

This is his way to get in on the act that he sees Glenn Beck being very successful with without having to feel like he's sold out. And I think that will carry through throughout even when he starts associating more with the Tea Party, he can carry this torch of I'm the real version of it.

So we have this my Ag Report, I think, with Alex Jones, bringing on that cop or playing that audio of the cop very clearly explaining what the mike report is about, and it not making a dent in the propaganda armor. We see the hopelessness of engaging with folks like Yes. Or at least with people like Alex, you see the hopelessness and the intentional propaganda that's going on, as opposed to it just being a misunderstanding. In addition to that you see here, the introduction of the Oathkeepers. And what you're going to end up seeing, and this, this puts into perfect context, why on the last episode, when I told you I went back, and I listened to the time around when that guy got caught with a napalm bomb in his house, who was the head of the Cleveland chapter of the Oathkeepers. And Alex was radio silent. It makes perfect sense. Yeah, he is with them. So he's not going to cover when one of them has a napalm bomb in their house. Nope. No way.
