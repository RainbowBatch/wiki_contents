There were still a lot of problems with orphanages and and abuse there as well, because statistically, governments and agencies and orphanages, public or private, abused kids more than parents statistically, so it's kind of a catch 22 You take kids from abusers, and give them to people statistically that have an even bigger pension for abuse where criminals of all types are attracted because they can then abuse people who are defenseless, and that's just the you know, go go go get a master's degree in criminology and you'll find out all about it.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:24:51.000
    | text      = So if you're just listening to Alex, you would not have very important context about this story that he's reading and it's entirely intentional on his part. He tells the story he wants the audience to hear and hides the details that are inconvenient for his ability to spin a bullshit yarns. The biggest piece of information he's leaving out is that the family was unhoused. A couple years prior and good luck husband was, quote, pretty sure that this had to do with outdated medical record, right. He believed that there was a misunderstanding that stemmed from medical records they had on file being from a time when they were experiencing homelessness, which makes the whole thing kind of make a lot more sense, right, right, over the years since they've had tons of temporary addresses. So you can kind of understand how none of these would necessarily be in the medical records. And CPS would be tasked with offering resources to an unhoused family having a child right. The second thing that Alex is not telling his audience is that the baby was put in CPS custody on Sunday and was returned to his good luck on Monday evening. It's something that's unfortunate and may not have been handled perfectly and maybe shouldn't have happened. And likely, if you know, better record keeping was done by all parties involved. It wouldn't have been this wasn't a kidnapping. And it lasted around 24 hours, right? It was about the amount of time that they needed to correct their clerical error and do the paperwork. Right, right. The third thing that Alex is leaving out in that for now, but we'll have to address later is that good luck is Navajo and her husband is Lakota. Alex is not bringing this detail up because he's trying to do this whole jag about how the system is really after white children. He expressed right and to address that dynamic, not existing in this big story he's covering would be kind of suspicious, especially if indigenous people rights dead and it leads to another major problem for his entire narrative. According to a 2017 release from the National Indian Child Welfare Association, quote, research and data from the states tells us that American Indian slash Alaskan Native children are disproportionately represented or over represented in the child welfare system nationwide, especially in foster care. This means that higher percentages of AI slash a n children are found in the child welfare system than in the general population. The over representation of AI A n children often starts with reports of abuse and neglect at rates proportionate to their population numbers but grows higher at each major decision point from investigation to placement, culminating in the overrepresentation of AI a and children in placements outside the home. One study found that due in large part to systemic bias, where abuse has been reported AI a and children are two times more likely to be investigated two times more likely to have allegations of abuse, substantiated, and four times more likely to be placed in foster care than white children. Right. This disproportionality has gotten worse in the time sense. But the rates, it was still significant in 2003. But this is a dynamic that Alex is not equipped to deal with. He doesn't actually care about fixing real problems of how the CPS operates. And he's actually averse to even acknowledging those problems because for him, the CPS narrative is really just a vehicle for him to engage in white grievance. Yeah, it to the extent that he will ever acknowledge that these are, you know, a Navajo mother and a Lakota father, he only will recognize it in it like now they're going to do it to us now they're doing it right. That is the way that he views this. And actually looking at the real dynamics is counterproductive for him. I

Oh, my God understood in its proper context, this story that Alex is covering is a prime opportunity to discuss this very clearly discriminatory pattern and how these government entities treat Native families. Further, it could be an opportunity to discuss the ways that benign mistakes like out of date medical information can lead to really difficult situations, but they don't necessarily have to lead to disasters. Either of these options would bring new real useful information to his audience, but neither would create the feelings that he wants to evoke, namely, that all white people are under attack and the government is coming to take your children. Yeah, taking note of the details that Alex chooses to ignore about stories is often a really important part of understanding his editorial process and illustrating what it actually is that he considers important, right? The truth is informing the audience isn't important. The truth itself isn't. But spreading racially based fear is pretty super important. Yeah, and I want to be totally clear about this. Alex is excluding information actively and intentionally so the audience doesn't get the full picture. After he comes back from break he continues reading the article and this is fucking damning.

And maybe the move towards automation was more about cutting down operating expenses by eliminating human workers. Also, I assumed that if this clip that Alex is describing is real, it was a woman just being like, Yeah, whatever. Yeah, it just, I don't want to talk to you. Yeah, that would make sense. Also, Paul seems to have no idea what he's talking about. Right now, McDonald's can refuse to serve you for any reason, as long as it's not because you're a member of a protected class. If someone's making a scene, they can be refused service. If you suspect that someone's drunk, you can refuse service. If someone's barefoot or wearing no shirt, you can refuse them service. As long as you're not discriminating based on protected classes, you have the right to run your business how you see fit. Like, for instance, it's not illegal for a high end restaurant to refuse to serve you if you don't fit their dress code, or like a hotel cannot take a reservation from you. If you stayed there before and you caused a problem. They can do that they can refuse service. They do have that right. Paul technically says that putting in self checkout is about being able to deny purchase of some particular product, but this makes less sense. Yeah. Is he suggesting that I might one day go to McDonald's and they'll refuse to sell me anything, but I'm a chicken because they think I've had too much red meat that day.

He's saying that there are MRIs in the airport and then reporting that it's some kind of a plan to detect aggression or nefarious intent in people. This is insane. But it's based on a kernel of truth, which is that MRI technology is used in airports, it's used to scan bags, because the idea of human application of MRI in an airport is laughable. If you've ever had an MRI done, you'll know that it's a complicated process where you are put into a big machine and then you have to stay completely still. Or else you'll ruin the pictures that the doctor is taking inside your head. While this machine angrily yells at you. Sometimes they have to give people like sedative, you have to go lunch. Yeah, imagining that you could effectively use MRI technology on something not staying completely still is absurd. And it would pretty much be useless in a crowded airport terminal. One of the primary applications of MRI tech in the airport has to do with screening liquids, because that's something that X rays are not traditionally very good with. Also 19 years later, and Paul's tenure predictions looking shitty. Does that mean like yes, it's not like there are things like data that's collected? You know, there are things about, you know, concerns about things listening, or what have you.

And throughout the rest of the show, everyone was questioning his integrity about the fact that he was hanging out with, in their words, these wacko gun knots survivalist. But the most interesting aspect came at the very end of the show, where one of the brothers walked into the gun club and found all the other members crowded around something talking. And when he said, Hey, guys, what's that? Made of the members came back and said, It's the machine were building to defeat the New World Order.
