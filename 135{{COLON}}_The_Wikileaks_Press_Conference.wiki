Today, Dan tells Jordan all about October 4, 2016, when Alex Jones got super duper excited about how Julian Assange was doing a press conference about how evil Hillary Clinton was. In reality, Assange was only doing a press conference about how Wikileaks had existed for 10 years, so the Gents just get to enjoy 2 hours of Alex slowly getting more mad.
