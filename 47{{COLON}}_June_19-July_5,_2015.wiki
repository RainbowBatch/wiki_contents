*The world is still reacting to the tragic shooting of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. [[Charleston church shooting|Dylann Roof]] has been apprehended at this point, and his explanations for his actions (starting a race war) have prompted a much needed conversation about true racism in this country.
*The UN reports that the number of people who are displaced due to conflict or persecution has reached 60 million, representing a 16% increase over the past two years.
*Aid and medical workers in Syria testify that Bashar Al-Assad has been using chlorine gas on his own civilians. Dr. Sparrow testified that we needed to impose a no-fly zone.
*The House of Representatives get fast-track approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

What Alex Jones covered on June 19th:

*Main Narrative: The Charleston Shooting was either pre-planned/staged by the [[Globalists]] to distract from the TPP, or is a real event that is being used by the Globalists to take people's guns away and/or trigger a race war. Basically, no matter what you believe about the shooting, Alex believes that if you think it had anything to do with race, you are foolish.
*Alex claims that the National Rifle Association was created specifically to help arm black people to fight back against the KKK. This is categorically not true, and [http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/05/harry-alford/nra-founded-fight-kkk-black-leader-says/ is just based on a debunked comment] made by Harry Alford in 2013. [https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/ The NRA's website] cites their creation as being motivated by some generals in New York being disappointed that their troops were bad marksmen and were wasting so many bullets.
*Alex conducts an interview with former Minnesota governor [[Jesse Ventura]]. At the time, Ventura had just won a defamation case against Chris Kyle, author of American Sniper. In his book and subsequent TV/radio appearances, Kyle had told a story about how one night at a bar, Ventura spouted off a lot of anti-America/anti-Marine speech, so Kyle kicked his ass. Ventura was appearing on Alex Jones' show because Kyle appealed the verdict and Jesse needed to raise some funds. Ventura's claim on the show was that all the major players in the media were behind the appeal, and that they were afraid that if Ventura's judgement stood, they would no longer be able to print lies about people. If they could overturn the case, they would be free to enrich themselves unjustly by slandering whoever they wanted. There are a ton of problems with this:
**The media companies were not behind the appeal. It was Kyle's widow (since Chris himself had been murdered by that point). Further, media companies absolutely have the right to report on claims that are made that turn out to be untrue, and are not subject to lawsuits for doing so. Integrity demands that they make a correction if they learn later that they reported a lie, but Ventura's argument is flimsy as hell.
**The case that Ventura initially won was very dubious. The jury could not come to a consensus, and after five days of deliberation only reached an 8-2 verdict. Both Kyle and Ventura provided witnesses that gave contradictory accounts of the night in question, and a judge in his appeal case called it "a credibility contest."
**Ventura would go on to lose this appeal and have the $1.8 million judgment awarded to him reversed. The reason was not because the media wants to be able to slander people, it was because Ventura's lawyer attempted to manipulatively sway the jury. Throughout the trial and in closing arguments, Ventura's lawyer kept talking about how HarperCollins (Kyle's publisher) had insurance that would cover the settlement if he won. The court allowed this argument, but on appeal, it was determined that they had failed to prove that such an insurance policy existed, and mentioning it unfairly biased the jury to find in his favor since it is shifting the consequences to a faceless entity as opposed to a widow.
**[http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/16/06/143876P.pdf You can't sue people for unjust enrichment in Minnesota] unless you are in a contract with them.
*Still no mention of the fact that Donald Trump is running for president.

The world on June 21, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/6/21/june-21-2015 June 21, 2015]</ref>:

*Donald Trump has been running for president for 5 days.
*The Congressional Budget Office announces that repealing the Affordable Care Act could increase the national debt by $137 billion
*84 people die in Mumbai, India as a result of drinking toxic homemade liquor

What Alex covered on June 21:

*Alex has gone from being hesitant to call the Charleston shooting a false flag to being pretty comfortable with the position. He still hedges his claims by saying that "black preachers say this things stinks to high heaven," but it is clear from his language that this is his position as well.
*Alex has had about enough of talking about Charleston and how the explicitly racially motivated shooting wasn't about race, so he uses his Sunday show to transition to a new narrative. He keeps the "2015 Will Be The Summer Of Rage" element from the previous narrative, but his new story line is primarily about how he has heard from "billionaires" that the Elite Globalists are starting to evacuate to "armored redoubts." He is never specific about anything, and this is a claim he's been making every day since, that the elites are *just about* to leave.
*His secondary narrative takes up most of the show. He has read a study about how the Earth is currently in the sixth extinction period of our history, [http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/scientists-build-case-sixth-extinction-say-it-could-kill-us-n378586 which is not at all inaccurate]. As the argument goes, us humans are in no way immune from the forces that cause extinction, so we should be careful. Granted, the article is titled very "click-baity," suggesting that humans are up next, but that's what allows Alex to use it to build his narrative that the Globalists are behind the extinctions, and they're telegraphing that they're going to kill off humanity.
*Jakari Jackon does a live report from Charleston about how the community has really come together and it's an inspiring thing to see. He talks about how beautiful the church service he attended was the night before, and seems to be excited about a march that was going to take place that evening. He brings up how weird it is that there are monuments to white supremacists on the same block as Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. It's a great report. The entire time, Alex keeps trying to shift the conversation back to negative things like a possible race war, and imaginary forces wanting to ban the Confederate flag.
*Alex explains that the key to understanding everything (I kid you not) is a Chik-fil-A billboard he saw recently. He explains that its "psychological warfare" because the cows are drawn realistically, whereas the chicken is drawn as a blob which humanizes the cows but not the chickens. I believe he was trying to make an abortion metaphor, based on the fact that the chicken just looks like a pile of goo. What Alex fails to take into account is that the premise of the billboards is that they are drawn by cows, who don't have fingers. They lack the motor skills to draw accurate chickens with their hooves. There are a hundred other complaints I could lob against his interpretation of this very clever ad campaign, but this isn't the place for it. Just listen to his blow-hard analysis.
*Continuing an anti-abortion theme, Alex explains that [[Michelle Obama]] is more racist than [[David Duke]].
*Alex has yet to mention that Donald Trump is running for president.

The world on June 22, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/6/22/june-22-2015 June 22, 2015]</ref>:

*Donald Trump has been running for president for 6 days.
*20,000 people convene to mourn and honor those who lost their lives in the shooting in Charleston. It is a tremendous sign of unity and hope.
*Then-FBI Director [[James Comey]] declines to call the shooting an act of terrorism, saying that terrorist acts are generally more politically motivated acts. This is a very fine line.
*Dylann Roof's manifesto reveals that the website for the Council of Concerned Citizens opened his eyes to the "brutal black on white crime" epidemic. This is clear evidence of the argument that far right wing propaganda is responsible for radicalization. The president of the CCC, Earl Holt is revealed to have donated substantial amounts of money to many Republican presidential hopefuls, including Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
*[[Julian Assange]] celebrates his third anniversary in the Ecuadorian Embassy.

What Alex covered on June 22:

*Alex gets cooking on this episode by laying out his eldritch vision of the what is to come. This clip is a pretty concise explanation of his view of what the Globalists are going to do, but doesn't include reference to a lot of their "side projects" (turning frogs gay, for instance). It goes without saying that this is an absurd paranoid fantasy, and he appears to just be kind of riffing it out. Unfortunately, he is not.
*Alex insults the religious beliefs of the Egyptians, due to their belief that mummifying a pet would allow them to enter the afterlife with you. He laments a society built around this "whacked out bull." Alex doesn't pause to reflect that he too believes in an afterlife and that if he behaves correctly according to an ancient book, he will be rewarded there, and that a great deal of our American society has been built around that equally weird belief system.
*Alex conducts an interview with former Ron Paul financial adviser [[Peter Schiff]]. The two men really just go to town on how the "bubble" is too big, it will probably pop any day and bring with it total financial collapse. Alex is clearly laying the groundwork for something, in terms of narrative, but it's unclear at this point what that thing is.
*[[Paul Joseph Watson]] comes on the show to screen an incredibly offensive, entirely pointless "special report" about people with trans identities. It appears that he conceived of the sketch in response to Rachel Dolezol (a story that broke on June 12, a full 10 days prior), but it misses the mark entirely and ends up being an exercise in cruel mockery of anyone who doesn't fit the mold that white, Christian, patriarchal society deems normal. It is such an embarrassment that Alex cuts it off in the middle, claiming it was "too racy" (also because he didn't bleep the n-word)

[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1495858015458-O3K4WOYI3PL0Z7RK9S4S/image-asset.jpeg|thumb|none]]

*Paul Joseph Watson, perhaps to make up for the swing-and-a-miss of his trans sketch, claims that there is no rape culture in the West, and that no one seems to care that there are problems with rape in a bunch of other cultures. He goes on to explain that there is no gendered wage gap and that [[Hillary Clinton]] is running for president on feminist lies.
*Alex believes that the Globalists are trying to distract people from TPP by getting them riled up about the Confederate flag, so to offset that, he embarks on a very interesting retelling of the Civil War, which includes a very bizarre and unsettling brag that "rednecks who know stuff bow down to me." This narrative that the Civil War wasn't really about slavery, and that it was about tariffs, has been [https://imperialglobalexeter.com/2015/03/02/debunking-the-civil-war-tariff-myth/ thoroughly debunked], and contradicts South's own secession convention documents (Fun Fact: [http://historymuse.net/readings/mississippiresolsecession.html Mississippi's Resolution of Secession] mentions "slave" or "slavery" ten times, but never once mentions "tax" or "tariff"; [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp South Carolina's] mentions slaves 18 time and "tax" once, but in a sentence about taxing slaves). There are plenty of other deeply flawed, subtly racist inaccurate claims Alex makes in this clip, but probably too many to list here. At this point, making these sorts of arguments is a definite indication of either: a) being completely misinformed, or b) holding slavery-apologist beliefs (or both)
*Alex Jones has still not mentioned that Donald Trump is running for president.

[https://www.democracynow.org/2015/6/23/headlines The world on June 23, 2015]<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2017/5/25/june-23-2015 June 23, 2015]</ref>:

*Donald Trump has been running for president for 7 days.
*In the wake of the Charleston shooting, then S. Carolina governor (now ambassador to the UN) Nikki Haley calls for the Confederate flag to be removed from the state capital building
*President [[Barack Obama]] appears on WTF with Marc Maron. It is a little weird for a sitting president to appear on a comedian's podcast, but most people are okay with it. Conservatives take great issue with Obama using the n-word while discussing race relations
*A heat wave has killed approximately 400 people in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, with temperatures topping 113 degrees. This is happening around the world, with deaths caused by heat waves increasing precipitously. Most scientists see this as a direct result of global warming, and it is a very ominous sign about how large a portion of the world will become uninhabitable in the near future.
*Negotiations continue in the Greek financial crisis
*Smog engulfs the city of Santiago, Chile, forcing a closure of businesses and a governmental declaration of an environmental emergency. This is the first time in 16 years their government has done so

What Alex covered on June 23rd:

*Alex Jones is incredibly bent out of shape over the Trans-Pacific Partnership being fast-tracked through Congress. He is absolutely certain that this one thing, the TPP, will be a death blow to the very idea of countries. According to him, it is not a trade deal, but an essential piece of stripping countries of their sovereignty and combining them into a one-world government.
*Alex spends a very large chunk of this episode playing a clip of then-Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] giving a speech on the Senate floor about how bad the TPP is. Though he is not at this point explicitly identified with the Trump campaign, this is the first instance of someone who would come to be a major Trump player getting positive coverage on the show in the 2016 election season. Alex calls Sessions a "super patriot."
*Alex conducts a return interview with alleged "Clinton insider" Larry Nichols. The last time he was on, he essentially told Alex that it was up to him and his listeners to save the world. This time is no different, as he strokes Alex's ego and builds up the savior complex that would propel Alex into losing his mind during the 2016 presidential election cycle.
*[[Larry Nichols]] promises to be back on the show every week, and on each appearance, he would reveal a new bombshell Hillary Clinton revelation. This week's: One time, Hillary Clinton went to a "witch church" with someone from Designing Women (sadly not Meshach Taylor)
*Alex continues to insist that the Civil War was not about slavery. According to him, it was actually about every other possible thing, but definitely not slavery.
*Alex conducts an interview with economist (?) Max Kaiser. Max is insistent that the dollar is just about to collapse. It will come any day now, and he has lots of conjecture and insinuation to back that claim up.
*Alex reveals that (as we all know, according to him) Hollywood is run by Jewish and Italian mobs.
*Alex has still not mentioned that Donald Trump is running for president.

[https://www.democracynow.org/2015/6/24/headlines The world on June 24, 2015]<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2017/5/27/june-24-2015 June 24, 2015]</ref>:

*Donald Trump has been running for president for 8 days.
*A study is released the reveals that non-Muslim terrorists have carried out more terrorist attacks in America since 9/11 than Muslim ones. Muslims have perpetrated 7 attacks compared to non-Muslims who have orchestrated 17 terrorist attacks.
*ISIS destroys ancient shrines in the city of Palmyra, which is seen by most as an affront to the history of humanity.
*Calls to get rid of the Confederate flag from state property spreads, with conversations happening in Virginia and Mississippi. Walmart, Etsy, and Amazon have expressed that they are not going to allow sales of Confederate flag items.
*Boko Haram kills 42 civilians in two Nigerian villages.

What Alex Jones covered on June 24th:

*'''PIVOTAL EVENT: '''Alex explains on this show how he had a dream the night before that "lasted six hours," and it was unlike any dream he's ever had. He describes it being like a prophecy, a prophecy of what the world is going to be like if the Globalists win. He is not very specific about details, but the way he speaks, it becomes clear that he has internalized this dream as some kind of message from the divine. This combines with the "you are the only person who can save us" comments that Larry Nichols made on the show on June 17th, and the picture of Alex's mentality for the 2016 election starts to come into focus.
*A lot of this episode involves Alex not really understanding that a lot of people have sincere feelings about societal issues. His position seems to be that all race, gender, and sexual orientation/identity issues are a distraction from bigger issues, and anyone who deeply cares about these sorts of issues is either actively working for the Globalists or is tragically being fooled by them. Alex lays out two examples from his life that he feels illustrate this:
**Alex doesn't like that people are against the Confederate flag, since it's just a symbol, plus lots of gangs wear professional sports teams' gear. One time Alex wore a 49ers hat and a cop asked him if he was in a gang. This argument is not compelling.
**Alex doesn't like that people are against the selling of the Confederate flag because when he was a kid, he bought Nazi memorabilia, and that doesn't make him a Nazi. Fair enough, and most people would agree with that, but it is every business's decision to make about what they will and won't sell.
*Alex conducts an interview with [[Paul Craig Roberts]] wherein the two side with Russia about the annexation of Crimea. They take the position that Russia is just trying to help the people of Ukraine deal with the manipulations of the Globalists.
*Alex conducts an interview with a college student named [[Lauren Southern]]. Southern is a reporter for Rebel Media, and she is on the show because she had recently posted a video where she went out to confront women at the Slut Walk. Here are a few clips from Lauren's report, with Alex muttering pretty offensive things in the background.
*Alex Jones has still not mentioned that Trump is running for president

[[David Knight]] hosted this episode.  We don't really care to talk about it any further.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/6/25/june-25-2015 June 25, 2015]</ref>

*Donald Trump has been running for president for 14 days
*President Obama announces plans to expand overtime pay for over five million workers. Under the change, those who learn less than $50,400 per year would be guaranteed time-and-a-half wages for working more than 40 hours a week.
*Tens of thousands of people in Greece protest over proposed austerity measures.
*The deadline approaches for Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program, and an extension is expected.
*The Supreme Court rejects Texas's attempts to make crippling restrictions to abortion clinics. Texas had attempted to impose restrictions that would have forced nearly all abortion clinics in the state to close.

What Alex Jones covered on June 30th:

*Alex explains that giving 150% effort is not a cliche or a myth. The Globalists have shackled us, so we think that 60% is actually 100%. It's a convoluted conspiracy theory version of a junior high school football coach pep talk.
*Alex tells a story about being schooled by a "very high level Globalist" on a plane. This Globalist in question explained to Alex that humans, when introduced to the technocratic slavery that's coming, they won't fight it, they will adapt to it, as humans always do to their environment. We feel that this conversation didn't happen, as evidenced by the level of detail and dramatization that Alex gives the story.
*Alex puts some of Charlton Heston's business on the streets.
*Alex and [[Anthony Gucciardi]] do a 30+ minute infomercial for [[Brain Force]]. It is so long, and it is literally all sales pitch. It's about 25% of his entire showtime, a show that theoretically has commercial breaks where this stuff should go.

The world on June 3, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/3/july-3-2015 July 3, 2015]</ref>:

*President Obama announces that after more than 50 years of not being in contact, the US and Cuba would reopen embassies in each other's countries and recommence diplomatic efforts.
*More than 100 die in clashes between government forces and militants in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, mostly ISIS identified militants.
*The UN announces a 83% increase in migrants entering Europe, fleeing war an persecution, many from Syria. They describe the situation as a humanitarian refugee crisis.
*NASCAR offers a "flag swap" for their fans, wherein they bring in a Confederate flag, and NASCAR would provide them with a US flag. Statistics are hard to track down, but it is hard to imagine that this program was well-received.
*Bernie Sanders sets the record for attendance at a campaign stop, as he spoke to 10,000 people in Madison, WI. He is still massively outmatched by Hillary Clinton in terms of fundraising.
*Macy's stops selling Donald Trump branded products in response to public outcry regarding his disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants.
*Wikileaks publishes much of the text from the TiSA (Trade in Services Agreement), another international trade agreement being discussed by heads of state, and some claim that it is more important to our country's trade agenda even than TPP.
*Girl Scouts in WA reject a $100,000 donation because the donor insisted the money not go to programs benefiting transgender girls. This Girl Scout chapter started a campaign #forEVERYgirl, and raised over $300,000, which could be used however they like.

What Alex covered on June 3rd:

*Alex believes that Trump is just in the race for publicity and that he is a shill to help Hillary get elected.
*Alex says that he does not trust Donald Trump, going so far as to say that Trump is not actually rich, and that he is a "front man for some consortiums on the East Coast," which is clearly a reference to the mob. This level of awareness in 2015 is very hard to square with Alex's state of mind in 2016 and 2017.
*Alex plays a video of Joe Biggs interviewing people around Austin about what we are celebrating on the 4th of July. It is a direct rip-off of a Mark Dice video they had played the day before, and it is inane. Alex uses the very clearly cherry-picked responses from people who don't know that we declared our independence from Britain to prove that everyone (especially "liberal trendies") is dumb, and that he (and his listeners) is the only person who still loves and appreciates America. This is something that he comes back to over and over on the show.
*Alex makes the claim that trial lawyers are secretly behind the push to legalize same-sex marriages, so they'll have other people to fleece. It's worth noting that Alex recently went through a divorce at this point, so it is fair to assume he's a little biased. Alex weaves this theory into a proclamation that heterosexual marriage is "regular marriage," and if you disagree, you are mentally ill.
*Alex tells a story of when he was descended upon by Satanists when he was covering an anti-abortion rally. The way he tells the story is hilariously over-the-top, and clearly untrue. The reality, if you watch the actual video (bizarrely titled "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2hKIrMVt08&spfreload=10 Sexy Women Hail Satan and Love Abortion]"- clip starts at about the 9:30 mark), it is very clear that these supposed Satanists are trolling. It is very unlikely that Alex doesn't understand that these people aren't actually crying out to Satan, and that he is just using this to score propaganda points.

The world on July 5, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/5/july-5-2015 July 5, 2015]</ref>:

*British Petroleum agrees to pay out $18.7 billion in a settlement stemming from their 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A large amount of these fees BP is paying are due to the Clean Water Act, which is something that Republicans in Congress are trying to dismantle.
*Jim Webb declares his intention to run to be the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election. This is the definition of a footnote in history.
*It is announced that the most wanted terrorist in Tunisia, Seifallah Ben Hassine, was killed in a US airstrike in Libya in June.
*A woman in Washington state dies of measles, being the first American to do so since 2003. The United States was declared "measles-free" in 2000, but most likely due to a growing number of people becoming anti-vaccination, the disease is making a comeback, with a total of 644 reported cases in 2015, the highest tally recorded in 15 years.
*President Obama announces he will commute the sentences of dozens of nonviolent drug offenders.
*Washington state announces that they have brought in an additional $70 million in tax revenue due to their legalization of weed.

What Alex covered on July 5th:

*Most of this show, Alex is still covering the financial situation in Greece, but doing so through the prism of how it is a test run of what the Globalists are going to do to the United States. Though the situation in Greece is, and was, awful, and the banks were acting in an exploitative fashion, it is incredibly difficult to take financial analysis seriously from someone fear-mongering while they stand to financially benefit from people buying gold (Alex's distributor, [[Genesis Communications Network]] is owned by [[Ted Anderson]], also the owner of [[Midas Resources]], a gold and silver sales company).
*Alex doubles down on his previous comments about how he does not trust Donald Trump. He goes so far to even say "Donald Trump doesn't matter."
*Alex reiterates his feelings that Trump is untrustworthy, but also indicates that he does like Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. It is worth noting that Alex agreeing with Trump's xenophobia is not enough to convince him to sign up with Team Trump.
*Paul Joseph Watson also indicates on this episode that he does not trust Trump. He says he thinks he is a narcissist and is just in the race for publicity.
*Alex is very mad about the "knockout game," wherein youths videotape themselves attacking strangers. Fears about this social media phenomenon were the subject of much coverage in right wing media, but Alex's take on it is so very racial. As he expresses in this clip, he feels that "gangbangers" are gods to hippies and trendies, so they become easy targets for attack. In contrast "good old boys in trucks" aren't being the victims of the knockout game, because everyone knows they have guns. The coded language displayed here is intentional, and is a subtle message to his overwhelmingly white audience about who is to blame for the problem, namely these turncoat hippies and trendies.
*Most of the rest of this show is covering a tragic story of an undocumented immigrant who murdered a white woman in San Francisco. Alex is furious about this, and spends a very large chunk of time on it, repeatedly drawing focus to her white-ness, and insinuating that this is the motivation for the crime, or at very least that people don't care about her being killed because of her being white. It is an act of complete twisting of reality. He brings in an unrelated quote from Black Nationalist leader Khalid Muhammed to try to inject overtones of racism against whites into the situation. Alex revisits this same case on subsequent episodes, but never really does any true analysis of it, past the point of spreading fear about this supposed "immigrant menace." He even warns that people from all over the world are coming to the US to engage in "murder tourism." Juxtaposing this level of coverage when one white person is killed to how dismissive he was after the Charleston shooting, and the fact that he never questions the murder of a white person as a "false flag," should tell everyone what they need to know about what really matters to Alex, namely white identity.
