Today, Dan and Jordan follow up on the last episode and discuss how Alex Jones' narrative about all of his enemies receiving bombs has evolved, and not in a positive way. It's now a false flag the Democrats are doing to themselves, so the gents discuss how dangerous an idea this is, and how troubling it is that so much of the right wing media is on board with him about it.
