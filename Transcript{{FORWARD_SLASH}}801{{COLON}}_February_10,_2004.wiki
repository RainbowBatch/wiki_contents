Yeah, trying to get back his feeling good about himself after that interview. And then he has an interview with a guy whose child died from suicide, after they got on some meds after they got on some antidepressant. Oh, my God. And the whole rest of the show is a lot of bullshit now about that. And I think it's not good. It's not interesting. It's stuff we've covered before. And I think I still would cover a little bit of it, because there are some points that can be rebutted here and there. And there are some important things to bring up about, you know, the conversation about mental health, and the medication stuff.

Because like if they make good points, and Alex says a good that's actually a pretty good point. That's thoughtful. I hadn't considered it that way. His whole idea about them like, Oh, it's just socialist Trotskyites around trying to pretend to be conservative, like all of that vitriol kind of falls apart if he has a relatively decent, or even friendly, thoughtful exchange with a neocon.
