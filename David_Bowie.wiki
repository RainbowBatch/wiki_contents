David Bowie was a singer/song writer, actor, and all around cultural influence<ref>https://www.davidbowie.com/about</ref>.

In the knowledge fight sphere, [[Solomon Berg]] has made (probably satirical) claims that a clone of David Bowie is in fact the president of Mars.

Also, when Bowie passed away in 2016, [[Alex Jones|Alex]] spent a large chunk of his show [[101: January 11, 2016|giving a weird, self-serving eulogy]].
