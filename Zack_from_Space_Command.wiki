Zack is the InfoWars version of Q.  

In Episode 118 Dan and Jordan suggest that Alex is gun shy after being "burned by 'Pizza Gate'".  This has made him wary of the growing Q Anon movement.  In order to compete with Q, Alex has, therefore, found his ultimate insider source. The man with all the intel and all the connections, Zack from Space Command.   Alex is upset, however, that Zack, despite being "who he says he is", doesn't get enough attention.

According to Alex, this is what we are allowed to know about Zack.

* His name is Zack
* He is public
* He is a "famous former member of 'Army Special Operations"
** and the "whole Joint Forces Operation out of Florida"
* He is "part Muslim, his mother was Muslim".
* There are "TV programs with him in it, his voice, his face"
* "This is real.  He is known to us".
* He is the "real Q Anon"
* He is currently with some of the "more wealthy folks in Morrocco"
** He was picked up by the FBI as a result of his last conversation on air with Alex
** He was taken to a US military base and subsequently released
** He has fled to Morrocco "where he believes it is safer for him to even be able to call into the show"
* His information is confirmed by Alex's other sources and sometimes even Q.
On his "Emergency Broadcast" from Christmas Eve, 2017 Alex reports, from Zack, that Trump will be attacked before December 28, 2017.

In Episode #150 Zack is a call-in guest who informs Alex that the plan is to battle for Mars.
