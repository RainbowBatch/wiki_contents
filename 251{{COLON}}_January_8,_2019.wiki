Today, Dan and Jordan discuss how Alex Jones decided to cover the idea that Donald Trump was threatening to declare a national emergency in order to get his wall made. In a turn of events that will surprise no one, it all turns out being a very racist affair, where Alex makes it way too obvious that he really, really wants to serve a dictator.
