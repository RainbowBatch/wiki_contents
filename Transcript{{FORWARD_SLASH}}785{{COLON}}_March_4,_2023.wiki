Sure, sure, sure. But you know, Giancarlo Esposito from Breaking Bad is the villain in the sixth one. And so that got me to be like, yeah, give this a try whatever it was, like heavily discounted on the PlayStation Plus share. And so I gave it a try. And holy shit. The sixth one is nuts. And so I felt deep into that hole. And then I saw that the fifth one is about trying to do battle against a cult that is taken over a small area in Montana. Yeah, that sounds familiar. And I'm like, wow, this is all right.

    | timestamp = 00:03:48.000
    | text      = that's fair. I think I think there's something about like, the way that your mirror neurons fire and you empathize with somebody who is holding a gun that you could conceivably hold in your daily life, that gives you more of a sense of immediacy and reality to it, as opposed to when you when you like, transpose those very same concepts into a place that can't hurt you into a sandbox of safety, then you're like, oh, it's fun to play around with guns, you know,

Yeah, whereas I think I think the way that I had pictured a lot of those, like, Modern Warfare and Call of Duty type stuff, it's like, the action is all there is yeah, you know, yeah, and maybe that's wrong of me to assume because I don't I've never played them right. Here's that way to me. Sure. Whereas the immersion of like in the in the sixth one, you're fighting, some guerrilla warfare again, right? They oppressive regime, and the fifth one you're fighting this cult that has taken over is real weird. So like, you know, there is stuff that you can really get absorbed in Yeah, the animal friends I mean, And

You know, like with a Call of Duty, they can be like, Hey, you're fighting in Vietnam and you assume all the shit that comes from fighter. They don't need to tell you about that. They're like, you're like, Fuck my grandfather's there in this game. He's right next to me. You know,

Now here's the great part about the Japanese baseball team. Shohei. Otani is neither the greatest hitter nor the greatest pitcher on their team. Wow. He's a close second for both, which again, makes him the greatest baseball player ever to live, right. But they've got a 20 year old pitcher named Sasaki, he throws 101 on the daily doesn't even try just throwing one to one lucky. Oh, he's walking out and he accidentally throws one I wonder what they've got a hitter, who's maybe the A's projected to probably be the best hitter in the major leagues in the next five years.

And I've just been committed to do that. I'm doing some catching up. Even though the world's in a more intensive, sane place than ever, I've committed to take off at least five, six days purely every month to spend it exclusively with my family.

But you know, that was working for a bit. But you know how Alec says he kind of wants to have something that's his own. It's more exclusive to his platform. And it's something that implies that his victory is inevitable. So you landed on the chain reaction, a chain reaction, the basic gist is that he's saying that the inciting event has already happened. And now a chain reaction is in progress that can't be stopped. Anything the globalist tried to do will just trigger another aspect of that chain reaction and then blow up in their face. I think that it's, there's a little bit of truth to this, but not as much as Alex is selling. The far right media has succeeded in radicalizing a significant portion of the population to the point where they live in a completely different reality and nothing will ever reach them. Internal Communications from Fox News can come out in the Dominion lawsuit that clearly illustrate that they lied to their audience intentionally and knowingly, and Tucker will remain the most important person in the world to them. Study after study come out showing that the vaccine worked and ivermectin didn't, and a lot of people will continue to follow and trust the people who still preach the opposite. I don't think this is really a chain reaction. But Alex is correct that he's helped foster and train a segment of the population to be blindly oppositional defiant, and ready to be mobilized against any right wing culture war battle, that the people who are in charge want. Yeah, media, the right wing media will just say go and

    | timestamp = 00:19:36.000
    | text      = I think an actual chain reaction is what's happening with Alex's legal struggles. He defamed grieving parents and that triggered a lawsuit. The lawsuit triggered him being completely uncooperative to the point where he was hit with a default judgment and ended up owing over a billion dollars. This gigantic judgment and the looming fear that he knew he was going to lose that case triggered Alex to try to pull off a phony bankruptcy and to mess around with his finance Isn't possibly hide money in various places like by creating Alex Jones Live, which is totally unrelated to completely unrelated the revelation of Alex Jones live led the bankruptcy court to order him to suspend that show and demand discovery of all documents related to that show and the claims that he made on air about it being separate from free speech systems. We're yet to see what this triggers, but I don't think it's completely out of the question to assume that Alex may have opened himself up to criminal liability. If he's up to no good. And he ends up being charged with bankruptcy fraud. That's just that's not a matter of fines. He could go to jail for five years.

I got mobbed continually in Mexico and I was kind of hiding out just on the beach. I got mobbed everywhere, and flying back out of Cancun yesterday. We got to the airport about two hours for the flight we got through security really quickly. And so I went and sat in a corner of a restaurant that was probably only a third full. And basically everyone in the restaurant came over and shook my hand and said we know about the New World Order. The Great Awakenings here we're gonna beat him together. It was like Fight Club.

Ship to vacations to Cancun. Yeah. So because seriously up with this, and if I had to guess it's just a matter of wasting money and living lavishly before that's not an option anymore.

    | text      = Yeah, I want to take a quick second here, though, to break down some of Alex's thinking. These people in Mexico are coming up to him and giving them all this free stuff. And they say that they're doing it because they know the system is against Alex, which means he must be good. This is not how most people think. But it is how Alex thinks. Most people take the information available about a person and then they make an assessment based on that. But this isn't how Alex experiences the world. For Alex everything is about defining yourself based on opposition. He knows that he's onto something when people attack him for saying it because he's convinced himself that is imaginary and enemies attack him the most when he's over the target, and thus negative attention and consequences are actually signs of virtue. This is a coping mechanism that Alex has developed. So he doesn't have to hear or consider criticism of the dangerous, stupid and irresponsible actions that he engages in basically on a daily basis. Most people in the real world living their lives don't need to employ this level of escapism to get through the day, so they don't come up with absurd rationalizations like this. People who are already fully indoctrinated into the info war, maybe have accepted Alex's premise on this shit. So I guess if everyone Alex encountered on his second vacation of the month were dyed in the wool info warriors, this could happen, I guess. I think it's more likely that Alex is making up a story and mysteriously every other character in it thinks exactly how he does. Because Alex says no creativity or ability to understand that other people's minds work differently than his own. Yeah. He's an idiot. Yeah, that's

And I can tell you as a gauge, kind of like, you get a turkey for Christmas or Thanksgiving and you buy the metal thermometer, you know, because the old one broke or whatever. And you sleds a thermometer in the turkey take care of your thermometer, so to see if you've gotten the middle of it cooked. And that's all I am as a thermometer. I'm a gauge because I'm well known my faces out there. And let me explain some of these aren't just people interested to take a photo with me and say they liked me. No. I would ask the people that say, Oh, really? What's the last time you tuned in two days ago? You were talking about this? Or they'll start telling you Oh, I was tuned in last few days to Oh, and we love Oh, and but when are you back? When are you back? I'm like, Well, I'm back tomorrow we talk to each other. What time what time? I got asked at least 10 times in the Cancun Airport when I was live again. And before I get out of my mouth a couple times they go NUDE NUDE, or will it be two o'clock? So your word of mouth, you spread the word about the broadcast all of you has caused a chain reaction.

And I've never heard him cite where he's getting that number from, and it hasn't been updated in years. It's wildly inconsistent to like he always just has it under 10%. Basically just choose whatever number he wants. Yeah, I have two rebuttals. The first is that I would love to see a national poll and what it would come up with if they tried to gauge the approval rating of Alex Jones. If he thinks it's going to be higher than 10%. I think he's got another thing coming to quote, Judas Priest, another theatrical, well done. Alex will get some traction on Twitter here and there because people love posting sensational things, he says, but in terms of actual support, it's got to be next to nothing. He puts out episodes of his show on his website, and they end up getting about 200,000 views, which is shit, assuming that each of these views represents 10 People who like Alex, which is generous as an assumption, yeah, that would be about 2 million people are about point 6% of the population. This is woefully unscientific, but I suspect if some actual polling was done, his numbers might actually be worse than a point 6% approval rate.

Roseanne was not a show that my family let me watch. My parents had a Real prohibition against shows that showed family structures that they felt were unhealthy. So a lot of those things like married with children, I appreciate that. Yeah, those kinds of shows were definitely off the table weirdly, though, like stuff like step by step was okay.

Like, let's say, Ted Nugent, and like, he sucks, and I'm also going to shit on his career. Yeah. Whereas with Roseanne now, there's a lot. There's a lot that she's done that stands.

Now, unfortunately, that is not a lasting life philosophy.

And then you ask because there just wouldn't be anything, bring something out of nothing. That is God. And so I know that being humble before God is, is essential, and realizing that we are really not God, but an expression of God's consciousness, and will and the fact that God wants to be able to commune with us forever. And God was basically lonely, show made creatures that have free will. But that's a gamble. Because God loves us so much. And God knows some of us, because we're given free will will join with with things that are not good, that are bad. And so if God did anything wrong, and I'm not saying God did it, it's the fact that God gave us freedom to do bad things. Let's take this always say, Well, God, allow all this to go on. Your God does this know God gave us consciousness and creation serve in front of the Heavenly Father of the universe, and all space and time in all dimensions that created this for us to experience incredible enlightenment and be able to interface with God?

He never shows anything on screen long enough for a viewer to actually read what he's showing. But just long enough, he can probably tell that it's a headline that appears to confirm whatever Alex is saying. These articles are also almost always from infowars.com, where Alex has critical editorial control over all the headlines that appear on articles, even when they're reposted from other media outlets. So he's essentially flashing up props. He's prepared to convince the audience that what he's saying is something that's based on grounded reality when it's just nothing. Yeah, it's a parlor trick, but it does exploit an element to brain science and that it's designed to make sure that any doubts viewers have will be quieted by the appearance of evidence. Yeah. Also not good. As a sign that Roseanne is bringing up Cathy O'Brien, who's not a good source on anything. O'Brien wrote a book in 1995 called transformation of America, where she claimed that she was forced into being a part of various government mind control programs like MK Ultra Project Monarch, she has zero evidence of any of her claims, which have evolved over the years to be much more extravagant, as we pretty regularly see with people who show up in places like Project Camelot. so odd. I don't give her claims a whole lot of credibility. And for my estimation, they're largely a combination of popular conspiracy theory lore, and remnants of the Satanic Panic that was still lingering pretty heavily in 1995. Writing is a good activity to engage in for its own sake, though, I agree with that. There's a reason that therapists often suggest to journaling or why they are that whole craze of people doing morning pages. Yeah, caught on there's a reason and it's because writing is a productive habit. Yeah,

Luckily, whatever audience he has, has no interest in questioning the things he says so he can get away with what he's doing right here. Alex is creating a narrative about his past statements and beliefs, which his audience will then accept as the gospel version of what happened. The more Alex repeats that he said, This Ukraine thing, he took it, he had it perfect, the more the audience will nod along with that, and the more they'll use it as an example of the times that hashtag Alex Jones was right. Meanwhile, they're just parroting the bullshit that Alex needs to feed them to save his own ass from his own past actions. Essentially, what Alex is doing is demanding that the audience except to complete fiction about his own body of work in service of making it easier for him to get them to accept future fictions that he sells them. But here's the irony. He's using this fictitious telling of the past in order to get them to accept that the next time that he says something like my sources telling me Zielinski is a Russian double agent, which the audience will eventually be forced to pretend Alex never said in service of the facilitating his next lie, right? In many ways. Alex's lies are a cycle of abuse that he has his listeners trapped in. It's really sad that they can't see the forest for the trees and recognize that he's just lying to them to steal their money and make them hate groups of people that he doesn't like and society.

Oh God, bah, bah, bah, who gets the shit about that can really deep experiential experiences and like, given knowledge I couldn't even understand and things and I said, God, give me peace to be strong. Let me really see what it is. I never really prayed for something. I always said, What's your Will God but I didn't say prayers. Will you show me what it is? And give me the knowledge. And I remember a couple of weeks that preceded that prayer every day. I had a series of dreams. And I know that different feelings. He's like a different flavor you've never tasted. He finally tastes a new flavor. You go God, I've never had that new flavor. This was it. This experience was 100% real. I can't even see the angel that was like it was there behind me showing me the universe and other civilizations and things that happened and how it works. And everything is just total knowledge download and like, feeling totally complete. Not ecstasy was beyond se was like timelessness like, I'm good forever. This is a good spot right here. But then Well, I got a curiosity. I want to look into what happened here why this happened. And I can see like civilizations that destroyed themselves and individuals that did. They were like, walled up tombs, God gave what they want. They were their own little, little thing. It was like old men just sifting sand forever. Like, there. They weren't even they were cut off from God. They wanted to be God. And it was so powerful. And I said, Can I just stay here? Can I know you got stuff to do, but you're already here. And then it happened again. And I got a little touch of it again. But that feeling is undoubtedly outside my body. There's no connection to anything ever experienced like that. Because it's so intense. You can't even it's so intense. You're done. It's like you're just like, I am complete. This is absolute connection, everything. There's no time. It's like I'm I'm here. And that is what the enemy knows they've cut off from. Yeah, they get to go against God. Yeah, they get to do bad things. Yeah, they get to play God. But they've been cut off from that.

So I want to present that story without comment except to say one thing. That pain that she's expressing that fear that she felt as a child is what so many of Alex's friends deny. She grew up around people who lived through the Holocaust. It isn't something that happened in the ancient past. She was around and alive around survivors. And as a child, she had a not completely unreasonable fear for her own safety because of the simple fact that she was Jewish. Many of Alex's associates people, he's friends with people, he platforms people, he offers a channel on bamdad video. There are people who say that the Holocaust never happened or that it was a big exaggeration. Roseanne is opening up about something really painful that terrified her as a child sitting next to a person who is all too happy to associate with people who would say to her face that the thing that traumatized her as a child didn't happen. What I'm saying is that she should choose better friends because Alex has a channel still up for Nick Fuentes, who's became bolder and bolder about his calls to expel Jews from the country. This is not the place for something like this, but like I do. Like what I feel sincerity from her you know like that. is moving that story that she has?
