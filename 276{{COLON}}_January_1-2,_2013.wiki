Today, Dan and Jordan continue their investigation into Alex Jones' reportage in the aftermath of the tragedy of Sandy Hook. As the new year begins, Alex is still deep in his "gun paranoia" holding pattern, but thankfully he keeps things interesting by telling a weird story about his past brush with Hollywood and interviewing a major player in the rise of militias in the early 1990's.
