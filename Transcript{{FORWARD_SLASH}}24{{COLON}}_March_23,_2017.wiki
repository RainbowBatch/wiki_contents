But the Nuremberg trials were exactly about Judge Gorsuch. The question was asked by our prosecutors after the war, why were German Nazi judges who were very sane and normal and had huge degrees from America, Britain and Germany, able to initiate laws that were against the Jews, like gays, whatever, and they were suppressed. And why would these decent people and this judge is an extremely decent individual, but during a 14 month period, he cracked his decency and literally began to go into the fascist state. He thought it was good to initiate a suppression of freedom, our surveillance of what are our normal freedoms, our increased enhanced torture, he justified it, went to Guantanamo said this was the best thing he could have had. He wrote to the Council on Foreign Relations. And remember, I was there and then I left that we should have a policy discussion on the need for torture. And so what happened during these 14 months was to reveal the underlying nature of this so called decent American who was not unlike many of the German judges who were decent German judges, but they followed orders and the orders were to suppress American freedoms. He should have said no.
