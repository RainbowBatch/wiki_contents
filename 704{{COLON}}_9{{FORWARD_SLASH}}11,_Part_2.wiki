Today, [[Dan Friesen|Dan]] and [[Jordan Holmes|Jordan]] wrap up their look at [[Alex Jones|Alex]]'s activities from September 11, 2001 by looking at his evening broadcast.  Does Alex still think the EU was probably behind 9/11?  Can Alex be any more disrespectful than he was that morning?  Does Alex get into a fight with a special celebrity guest?
