And I think a lot of people probably want us to cover that stretch of time. Sure. I would say that. It's not as fulfilling as you want it to be. It's actually a lot of virulent transphobia. Yeah. Yeah. So I didn't necessarily want our return we haven't recorded in over a week. It's been over a week, so I didn't want it to be just a beating over the head with awful things. It isn't Welcome back from vacation, which we can do for Wednesday. You're certainly we can loop back to this week. not saying we're not going to cover it, of course, but I felt like a reunion. We needed something else a hated something that didn't have a like real blah, yeah. flavor to it. So I'm sticking around to the past. Okay. And we're going to be talking about January 30 to February 2 2004. All right. Do you know what happens during that time? I do not. I'll give you a spoiler. Okay. The Super Bowl. Ah,

I don't know the team with a no, that was probably 2003. Or no, this would have been the 2003 2004 season. This may have been when Devin Hester opened the Super Bowl with a kickoff return for a touchdown on the season that he was absolutely amazing for and then the bears lost by 40 points.

And this actually isn't the sharp focus of the episode. But it does come into the February 2 episode, because that's on a Monday, right. So we're talking about a February our Friday to Monday gotcha thing and the Superbowl is over that week. Okay. So we'll get down to business on this and have our little return voyage.

You know, you still got to vote for Bush, because, you know, we can't have the Democrats in there. And yeah, we just got to get used to it, you know, so the government's grown by 45% in the last three years.

    | text      = Oh, in the case of Russia, it's that Russia is making excuses for Bush's tendency toward big government and appealing to how the alternative is way worse in order to make sporting Bush more appealing to the audience. Compare that to the extreme levels of rationalization Alex does for Trump where he has to tell the audience complicated stories about how Trump put out the COVID vaccine, but he didn't know what he was doing or that he was tricked by the globalists into doing it. every bad thing Trump does has an in world explanation that at least partially exonerates him from full blame. And think about how Alex has created a world for his audience where you have to support Trump, at least partially because the alternative is the Democrats who he's trained the audience to believe are literally demon possessed pedophiles who want to drink your children's blood.

    | text      = Little late, no, turns out the Democrats are getting a lot better. What? Okay, in the past, Alex called this behavior, sophisticated propaganda. And on some level, he's right. It's at least somewhat manipulative persuasion. But part of the reason he's attacking Russia like this in the past is that he didn't understand the game Russia was playing, because Alex had the luxury of not being invested in electoral politics. electoral politics is at best an attempt to get a representative into office, who will try to get your preferred policies made into law. The candidates themselves aren't human embodiments of these policies, and people have some maturity, recognize that even if a person you want to win gets into office, that doesn't guarantee the policy you want will pass simultaneously, you recognize that if the person you support loses, that's not the end of the road for you supporting the policies that you support. That's something that exists on a plane above the election. The election is just an opportunity to put into office, people you believe will help support the policy you want to see enacted. At its worst electoral politics is essentially a boxing match. It's a singular event that happens and then once it's happened, your person is in or they're not. When you're an entertainer on the political space, and you don't foster any deeper appreciation for what politics is in your audience. This is how you have to interact with elections, building towards a climactic conflict and building the tension around that event drives ratings and gets listeners excited. In 2003. Alex wasn't on some mature tip when he was actually above focusing on electoral politics, but he was pretending to be and that was a solid brand, and allowed him to make criticisms of this, like this of rush. And at this point, it's really hard to argue with his point, in order to support Bush rush does need to make a bunch of rationalizations and appeal to lesser of two evil arguments. Because the end goal of winning the election is all that's important there. Russia is more of a GOP shill and but he and Alex are both entertainers. It's just at this point, Alex was pretending to be more than that. Now that Alex has taken a bite from that forbidden fruit of supporting a candidate who won the election and seeing how much money he was able to make off centering his entire coverage and worldview around propping up the central figure he finds himself in a similar position to where Russia was in 2004. The big difference is that Russia never cried on air about how Bush was a God appointed king or how he was willing to die for Bush. Alex is essentially a comically desperate version of what he called sophisticated neocon propaganda in the past. And you know, it's it's fun to see these glimpses because another thing you can take away from it is that Alex understands this in the present day. He knows these techniques he knows, like very valid criticisms of the very things that he's doing. Yeah, it's not some like he's not totally Magoo. No, no, no,

It must be the case that there was some evidence or that he came home and you know, they were able to point he was able to point out the people who did it. Sure, but none of that happened. Oh, in the real world, Johnny gotcha was a child who disappeared most likely kidnapped on September 5 1982. While he was out doing his paper route. He lived in Des Moines, Iowa, and he's never been found by most accounts. He's presumed dead. Do you know any of the terms that were being thrown around like the Franklin cover up? None. Okay. No clue. Okay. Yeah. Well, you're in for interesting, right. So this is a messy situation because a lot of the information that's being bounced around by people like Alex and Jack Blood, it comes from Johnny's mother Noreen, and from interpretations made by Satanic Panic enthusiast and your good friend Ted Gunderson. Yeah, there we go. Yep, he's in the mix again. There we go. Not enough people. Not enough people. Yep. It's very difficult to parse facts from fiction and many of the narrators in this story seem kind of unreliable. Take for example, the story that Jack is telling about Noreen coming home to a mutilated doll, which was meant to be a warning. This apparently was after she had done an interview with a completely obscure Christian radio host Marty Stacy on KCRW Oh, in Omaha, that seems like an overreaction from a kidnapper. Particularly given that was over 20 years since Johnny had gone missing. But if you have to understand this in context, Noreen has told some pretty hard to believe stories since her son went missing in 1999. She claimed that two years prior her son now 27 years old visited her randomly one night at 2:30am He was accompanied by another man And who was completely unidentified, but who apparently was in some kind of a supervisory role over Johnny. They talked for about an hour and a half, during which time he told her that he was taken by a pedophile organization, but that he had gotten too old. The details on this are very hazy, and no one has been able to find any evidence that would establish that this meeting ever happened. And based on everything about how people work, it seems unlikely that it did.

    | text      = don't know how you can prove right? Some stuff isn't true. Right. That brand of right thing. Gotcha. So this guy Bonacci. He in 1999 was suing Larry King, and Noreen was called in to give testimony. So Bonacci claimed the king had abused him and that he was forced to take part in gotchas, kidnapping, which is how this all ends up being connected to the Franklin such Wow, okay, multiple family members of told authorities that Bonacci was at home at the time of gotchas disappearance. So his claims on that front weren't really taken all that serious wait. So this is the case the Jack Blood is referring to and it wasn't a successful civil suit, except on a technicality. Larry King was the central figure of these allegations in the Franklin case, and that was who Bonacci ended up suing because the other people that he sued were removed from the suit. Right. King was already in jail for embezzlement convictions. And as I understand it, he just didn't respond to the suit. So Bonacci was awarded summary judgment. Right. The facts of that case, were not determined in court, which is what Jack Blood is trying to suggest. And Alex and people who were convicted, yes, Larry King was convicted of embezzlement. Right. So like the actual allegations of like this ritualistic child abuse, that was not something that they were convicted, right, right. I don't want to spend too far afield into the Franklin situation, although because I thought we talked about it before, but I guess not. So we'll talk about it another time that Alex brings it up in more detail, so I'll make this as concise as possible. There were four people who initially made allegations that there was a child trafficking ring run out of Boystown in Omaha with Larry King at the center. Super rich and prominent figures were involved in the ring and there were connections with elites in other parts of the country. When the case was brought before a grand jury. Two of the accusers recanted their eClaims Bonacci was one who didn't. Along with Alicia Owen, the grand jury ended up claiming that the case was a quote, carefully crafted hoax and did not indict any of the accused. But they did indict Bonacci and Owen for perjury. Oh and ended up serving four and a half years in jail on the charge. Months later, a federal grand jury heard the case and arrived at the same conclusion that the accusations were unfounded and they also indicted Owen. The conspiracy around this has continued largely because there was another investigator working on the case named Gary Cara Dhoni. Sorry, Gary Cara Dory. Kara Dory had taken a trip to Chicago in July 1990. Around the time that these grand juries were making their determinations. On his return trip, his small self piloted plane crashed, and he died along with his eight year old son who was also aboard. Naturally, this was the work of the globalist to blew up his plane as part of an elaborate cover up. According to the conspiracy share, the story became that he called his boss before heading back telling him that he had found the smoking gun. And this evidence was destroyed in the every time, I can find no evidence that I find credible that this call was made. But it proves and provides conspiracy theorist with the perfect if only story share, which is a feature of so many of the narratives we end up seeing on Infowars. The crash is sad, but William Bruce, the investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, told the Lincoln star that he'd seen crashes like that in the past, and it appeared that the wings had become separated from the plane. This usually happens in cases where pilots lose control of the plane, they go into a dive, and then their speeds go past what the plane can structurally handle right. There's also speculation that he had hit some bad weather and lost control, which is a plausible scenario. Anyway, the point here is that I can't really prove nothing happened in Omaha, but the allegations that have been made and the things that are claimed to have been covered up just are not proven at all right. One of the people making the allegations who ended up indicted for perjury claimed that he was involved in kidnapping Johnny Gotch, which I think is tough to see as credible. Conscious disappearance was a national story. And his picture was famously, one of the first that was ever put on a milk carton was one of the first milk Kardashians gotcha, it stands to reason that Bonacci might want to connect his own civil suit to that giant media rich story for his own reasons, right. Whatever the case, Bonacci claimed he kidnapped Gotch and then got his mother testified in his civil case about how Johnny had shown up in the middle of the night for a random visit, which no one can verify. It's almost impossible to believe, right? These are things that I'm dubious of, but for someone like Jack Blood, all of this is true and proven. It's all concrete. This is all established fact for him because he wants it to be this narrative structure preserves the organized evil nature of his imaginary enemy team, which is critical to him retaining his own heroic image that he can project onto the audience. Yeah. Further, they're complaining about this Marty Stasi guy getting fired from his radio job, but in reality, there's a decent chance that his broadcast may have been defamatory. If he was covering the subject irresponsibly, odds are that he might have named some names, and the station probably didn't want to deal with that kind of possible trouble. That's something that would have happened to Alex years ago if he had a boss. Yeah. Yeah. So I can see that as being a plausible reason why Marty Stacy got fired if it weren't for any other possible insubordination.

    | text      = So Alex has just decided that Janet Jackson's breast being exposed during the halftime show of the 2004 Super Bowl was intentional, and it was meant to desensitize the children. First of all, I think that children were plenty desensitized in 2004. The internet was widely available and pornography was one click away from anyone who wanted to look at it. There isn't any desensitization value that's going to come from this, like the swimsuit issue and low writer were sold at every grocery store in the country. And really, how much of a difference is it between a tiny bikini and technically seeing a nipple. So really that much difference in terms of desensitization? If anything, the response to that halftime show probably had a reverse effect of desensitization, where children were taught that the nipple is a horribly shameful thing to see in public or expose. I wouldn't be too surprised if there was far more of an impact in that direction. Of of like stigma. stigmatization Yeah, also not for nothing. Janet Jackson has been pretty open about this. And what she went through is really, really shitty. Yeah, her outer layer was supposed to be ripped off to reveal lingerie underneath but it didn't go as planned and for that she was demonized. Well, Justin Timberlake who did the ripping more or less got a free pass. Yep, her career took a massive hit with stations and even MTV not wanting to play her music, which didn't happen for Timberlake. Less Importantly, the backlash to this happening involved halftime shows that we're all old rockers and boring shows like Paul McCartney the Rolling Stones, and Tom Petty was okay, and then Bruce Springsteen, sure. I wouldn't be until 2011. But a modern Act would be featured in the halftime show and that was the Black Eyed Peas are relatively safe. Justin Timberlake came back to perform in 2018.

    | text      = So Alex is just making up all the details that he's not directly reading from an article. They don't say the Congress has a copy of the video in question and that they declared it national security secrets or whatever. Here's what's going on. At this point in 2004. Terry Nichols is about to stand trial for his role in helping Timothy McVeigh pull off Oklahoma City bombing. His defense attorneys are trying like crazy to cast blame anywhere they can in order to plant seeds of reasonable doubt to get him off the hook. It became a whole mess where they were trying to call over 100 Witnesses seeking to bring up insinuations about, quote, a group of bank robbers, Iranians residents of the white supremacist community Elohim city convicted murderer, Chevy, Kehoe, and others. In that context, a lawyer named Tom Mills Jr. claimed the back in 1998. A congressional aide named John Culbertson had showed him pictures of the explosion. Quote, The attorney said the aide told him the photos came from a federal agent who was part of a sting operation that was supposed to stop the bombing but failed. John Culbertson has testified under oath that he has no such evidence and I have a tough time getting a handle on what he's actually all about. In a local news article. He's credited as a former congressional aide and an employee of the Arkansas Chronicle. I found the speech and the Congressional Record the Jim Transcat gave that discussed a review of the Murrah building security prior to the bombing that was conducted by Culbertson. So he was you know, he's traffic hats aide. Sure he's doing a review of their security. Sure. And an article in the New American the publication of the John Birch Society they credited him as a quote construction and demolition analyst. I don't know if that's a credit he has, oh, I have no idea what his real credentials are. But this also appears to be a case where it's more people like they're making stuff up about him and embellishing him than him making it up himself. ROD I can tell Gotcha. So Mills, that lawyer told the nickels defense that he'd seen these photos and on the basis of his affidavit, Culbertson is home was searched, and his computers were seized. Now, here's where things get sticky. Culbertson was an employee of the Arkansas Chronicle, which is barely a real thing, but it does technically exist, and it maybe makes him a journalist. Okay. He was their Washington bureau chief, although at that time, he also might have been their only employee from 1996 to 2000. The publication was run by a man named Jim bolt, who returned after Culbertson. His house was searched as they were looking to transition the publication to being an online only format. At that time, he and Culbertson made up the entire staff of the Chronicle. Naturally, because they were in journalism bolt brought a suit against the search. He tried to sue. Sure, sure, sure. Sure. This is from the Dallas Morning News, quote, under questioning by a state prosecutor, Mr. Bolt acknowledged that he and Mr. Culbertson were the publication's only employees and he gave conflicting answers as to whether he was Mr. Culbertson boss, or vice versa.

Culbertson showed up the next day and testified that they were just generic images of an explosion, but there was no real way to tell if it was even the MER building or any context around here. Sure, sure. So at this point, the judge said that the hearing was a quote, waste of time. He went on to say, quote, There was absolutely unequivocally no evidence whatsoever of photographs of the Murrah Building blowing up, ie one of Nichols lawyers, Brian Hermanson, who wanted this evidence to be taken seriously because it helped cast doubt on his clients guild even said, quote, When all was said and done, we didn't believe the guy after request.

He was an Oklahoman. And I guess he just took a serious interest in the topic and started digging into things. There are definite things that he did some we decent reporting on. For instance, he was the person who spoke to Carol how a federal informant who had lived at Elohim city and claimed that she had heard a conversation about bomb plots between Dennis Mahan and Andrea strossmayer. How was a white supremacist who was at Elohim city and dated Mahan, the two had a falling out in 1994, at which point she was recruited by the ATF. She definitely spoke with the FBI after the bombing, but she's claimed that to cache that she spoke to her contacts at the ATF and told them about the bomb plot and conversation she overheard about five months prior to the bombing. It's unclear if this is accurate, and even if it is, it's unclear how specific the information she relayed would have been. But this is a story that cache was at the center of bringing to light. He was able to do this because he was embedded at the white supremacist and Nazi headquarters. It doesn't appear that he necessarily shares their worldview, but some other journalists have definitely raised questions about the ethics of how he went about courting sources. Apparently, his buddying up with extremists went so far as to publish articles in extremist publications like Jubilee and media bypass as well as speaking at an extremist conference called jubilation, where he followed Aryan Nations ambassador at large Louis beam on the podium. Yeah, Louise spoke first and then him.

And he was also very friendly with the McVeigh defense attorneys, which will definitely make people a little bit concerned about bias. Yeah, that comes into play as it relates to what was probably his largest moment in the spotlight. And 1997, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News dropped a bombshell story that he'd obtained a defense document which contained Timothy McVeigh making an explicit confession to one of his lawyers. Everyone was a bit taken aback by this and McVeigh's defense team was understandably a little bit late on details. Yeah, when asked for a response Sure. Someone who was quick to go on the attack about this was JD cash. According to cash. This was a fake confession that the defense team had put together to use as a prop in order to convince someone else that there was no danger in them coming in for an interview because McVeigh had already confessed to doing it all himself. It's widely believed that this other person is Louis beam, but there's no way I haven't found any like solid confirmation of that, but that's what most people believe due to his contact right? Rare I have you Okay. Wow. Yeah. As implausible as all this sounds. It does appear that this story is true. Another member of McVeigh's defense team investigator named Richard Raina had shown the dummy confession to cash a year prior and they had a big laugh about it, according to their story. So when cash saw reporting about this confession, he recognized some of the language from it and came out saying it was a hoax. After he did McVeigh's lead attorney Steven Jones began to get a bit more specific with his responses and took that line about the suppose confession that it was a dummy confession meant to lure in another witness. Weird.

You may notice that this color didn't claim that and Alex is making his claims in response to something cash said a little bit earlier in the episode, Alex made this claim to cash himself right. So he's responding cash is responding to that, right? There's a little bit of a bounce back. Right. And interesting point about cash seems to be that he believes that there were multiple explosions that day, but he doesn't believe that there were bombs planted in the building. From what I can tell his theory is that there were bombs or other explosives that were being stored at the ATF office in the Murrah Building. And the explosion caused them to detonate and secondary explosion, but that there's been a cover up of that. Okay, in terms of logical leaps, this is way more reasonable as a place to be because you can imagine that if there is an ATF office there, which there is, they may keep items that were confiscated from searches of arrests there, and one such item might be a bomb. And you could believe that there could be a legitimate reason why they might not want to be upfront about that. For one, it could paint a picture that ATF offices are inherently dangerous, which could hurt with them leasing property, or another direction could be that they wouldn't want to reveal exactly what they'd confiscated because it could give away part of an ongoing investigation unrelated to McVeigh. I'm not saying that this is the case. But there's a little more of a grounded conspiracy there than the type that Alex tends to engage. Yeah,

    | text      = So Alex is just blurring all kinds of details about the David Kelly case, because as we've seen unfolding, he's in the process of turning it from a real event into a piece of his Patriot conspiracy lore, much of the same way that you know, he's lying about the Ann Coulter interview to make it a myth. He's doing the same thing as it relates to the David Kelly story. Yeah, he has his established narrative in place, which is that Kelly was murdered. And so every little detail that he covers about the case needs to be bluffed and finessed. So it fits that narrative. In this case, Alex is just lying about this comment in large part by depriving the audience of the context of that comment was made in because it's essentially a real comment. Yeah. It wasn't said to a female American coworker who was a fellow weapons inspector, it was said to a British diplomat named David bruiser. It wasn't said just before Kelly's death, it was about six months prior in the lead up to the invasion of Iraq. He didn't say that some shadowy unknown group was going to kill him and put him in the woods. He was saying that if the invasion went forward, he'd quote probably be found dead in the woods. But the reason for that comment is clear. He was worried about the Iraqi contacts he had, many of whom he feared would feel betrayed by him if the UK invaded, particularly around issues related to weapons of mass destruction. It came out in the Hutton inquiry that Kelly had made indications bordering on assurances to his contacts that the war could be avoided. And the idea that an invasion might still happen that made him rightly concerned that the danger that he could be in because of those assurances that he'd made to high level people, right? Ultimately, a comment like this makes me feel even more convinced about the suicide determination because it helps illustrate the headspace and a fear and guilt that Kelly was feeling at the time. Yeah. What's important to recognize here is the way that Alex is wantonly misreporting details around this comment because the actual context puts his narrative into more question, whereas his phony version makes his narrative seem more likely. Without the context of who Kelly was worried would kill him, Alex is able to pretend that this is about him worrying about retribution for supposedly blowing the whistle on WMD intelligence by presenting this as something that was said in the immediate time just before his death, Alex is able to tie the comment to the death far more directly than reality would allow. This is one of Alex's primary ways of lying, and it's something that he's able to pass off as just being sloppy or speaking extemporaneously without notes or a teleprompter. He can use that excuse if he's called on about one particular detail like in this case, he could say the Miss Miss remembered who he was speaking to or so, but it's imperative to understand that this is a universal pattern. His sloppiness and unprofessional approach to his job actually provides cover for the misrepresentations and lies he presents as researched fact to his audience feature

    | text      = Chris Simcox is not the editor of a reputable local paper with his why Alex phrased it like that. He's the founder of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps, a border vigilante group that violently harasses immigrants. He's another one of the pieces of shit who Alex presents to his audience as heroes. And it's worth noting that he's not a person that Alex would admit to knowing anymore. That's because Simcox is currently in prison serving an over 19 year sentence after being convicted in 2016 of molesting a five year old girl. It's probably also really terrifying to realize that prior to his shift into being a border vigilante Simcox was an elementary school teacher in classes from kindergarten to third grade for 13 years. Two of his ex wives filed for protective custody from him, one in 2001 and another in 2010. The first ex told the court that Simcox had threatened deadly violence and it slapped their four year old son so hard he had a mark on his face for two days. The ex wife from 2010, who has actually Simcox, his third wife told the judge that he quote brandished a gun and threatened to shoot her the children and any police officers who tried to protect them. As is so often the case when he looked back through Alex's catalogue, the guests he has on are all complete monsters. It's bad enough that this guy's only real claim to fame at the time is that he was demonizing immigrants and harassing them while heavily armed. But when you get into who he actually is, you start to see the caliber of person Alex puts on a pedestal. It really feels like if you peel back even a single layer on most of Alex's guests from this time period, you end up with a literal Nazi or a child abuser way more regularly than you should. These people are awful. Yep. Real shit.

All right, given the details that he provides, it's impossible to verify this story given that We have no idea when this happened. There are no names provided. So cross checking doesn't really work. I couldn't find anything. I tried to find back issues online of the tombstone, tumbleweed, but shocking league yeah unavailable. In this environment where Simcox is willing to do this shitty of a job, he could legitimately just make up whatever story he wants, and people like Alex will accept it as real, because it conforms to the narrative that they they want to perpetuate, namely, that migrants are an existential threat to the noble whites of the country. Not only will Alex accept whatever story he's told that lines up with what he wants to believe. He'll then use that story to advocate for summary executions to be carried out on these people by the police. If Alex were someone who cared about the truth, he'd be more careful about what stories he just blindly accept. If Alex were someone who cared about the rising police state as much as he pretends to, he would never excitedly wish that the police could just randomly kill people for non capital crimes, just because they're part of a vulnerable population that happens to hate.

Compounding the suspiciousness of this is the fact that dever publicly presented himself as a teetotaler and a devout Mormon, because he was a real anti immigrant type of sheriff who appealed to the Bigot types like Alex and Simcox, conspiracy started to swirl after his death. It was really tough to make this look like a murderer though because he had so much booze in his system. He was alone in the car, there was beer and liquor bottles in the car, bunch of them, and there was a witness to the time surrounding the crash. Another motorist had been behind him but lost sight when dever went around a corner or a curve. After that the witness rounded the curve he saw that there had been a crash and this is exactly where you would expect a super drunk person to crash because their ability to navigate and negotiate the curve would be diminished. Yeah. Anyway, Sheriff dever more than anything else seems like another one of these severely anti immigrant sheriffs who like to provide cover for extremists like Simcox. They they legitimize things by virtue of their position they They like we got to deputize people like Jim Cox. And then he is allowed to sort of run free and do all kinds of really irresponsible and shady things. Yep. Yep. And by all counts, he was a hell of a drinker. Because if you're driving with a BAC of point two, nine, you're either drunk all day, every day, or you're not but one day, you just decided to have 15 drinks at an hour. I mean, seems unlikely. Yeah,
