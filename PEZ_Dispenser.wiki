"PEZ Dispenser" is a term coined by [[Jordan Holmes]] to refer to people who are basically repackaging or conveying [[the Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], a wildly anti-Semitic forgery that unfortunately underpins a disturbing amount of far-right conspiracies.

For instance, [[Alex Jones]] would be accurately described as a PEZ Dispenser because his claims about the [[Globalists]] closely mirror the Protocols.
