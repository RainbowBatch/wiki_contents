So we'll get to this installment but because people have asked on Twitter, and you just asked me right before the show, I want to get everyone up to speed with what's going on in current day, because we're not going to cover it. Last week was a shit show. There was no show on Monday again because of Memorial Day, right? And then Tuesday, Roger Stone talked a whole bunch with Rick Derringer about I am a real American to our everlasting delight. Hulk Hogan theme song amazing. Yep. Wednesday, Mike Cernovich. And Alex Jones announced their huge Kathy Griffin contest. That's, that's on Wednesday, Thursday. They don't talk about that. Because she knew it. I knew it. Yeah. Fantastic. Still going on ostensibly. But they Alex is he's moved on. And now he's super into how cool it is. That Trump left the Paris Agreement. Great. Because in Alex Jones his conception and his framework, the the planet is carbon starved. There's not a carbon dioxide.

He's still in his manic Episode. So he's talking about how July 1 2017 will be the most important day in history. And here's why is because he believes that the way the globalists fund themselves is through this carbon tax that's been imposed. Climate change isn't real. It's all a short rod to create a carbon tax that goes to Al Gore. I don't I don't, I don't get the A to be there. But be that love it. So he's celebrating this. He's losing his shit. He's going on and on about like weird Biblical stuff. It's so strange. He's talking about God's eye and what have you, oh, boy, which may or may not be a reference to Fast and Furious six,

So he's, I don't, we discussed it a little bit on the last episode that when he's in this sort of manic state, it's tough to talk about it without making fun of what is sort of overt mental illness. Right. So I don't want to talk about that. And on the same token, the climate change stuff is just so loony that I don't want to make because you wouldn't even want to make you would freak out.

It came out on the internet last week that Paul Joseph Watson eats books. Yes. And I want to make it very clear that I hate him. He is his beliefs are stupid. But I resent everybody making fun of him for his alleged pica. You know, that is a condition and I really don't like to see people when he is so fucking open to attack for so many other things. All of these people making fun of him because he came out and admitted that he eats paper. I don't think that's okay.

    | timestamp = 07:53
    | text      = In the past, he has talked about how he is a bit of an agoraphobic and rarely leaves his apartment, right. And again, that's the thing that I don't feel any interest in making fun of and I empathize. I feel really, I feel bad for him in those instances. So when I see people making fun of him, it just, it bums me out because he sucks, but not for these reasons and it's unfair. And it gives him an opportunity to re attack back and be like, Oh, isn't this the tolerant left making fun of my mental illness? Yeah, it's a trap. But it's I'm not saying that he's faking it as a trap. But it is a trap you can fall into of course, and it just really bums me out when people don't take the right attack plan on these assholes. Yeah, it's just stick to the reality. Don't insult them for things that are human
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 08:38
    | text      = right. Don't make fun of him for being afraid to leave his house. Make him afraid to leave or train vultures to attack him the moment he walks outside. Ah, you can teach ravens to teach their own families to hate this man. We need we need an army of birds. I think that's where my mind is at right now. Because you know, they're the only ones who are going to survive once the rest of the Earth is flooded.

Today's episode is going to be covering the timespan of July 6 to July 13. So we're gonna be going over that. But to give you guys a little bit of a last time on the investigation. Alex Jones did not mention Donald Trump for a long time. You spent a lot of time talking about a Chick fil A billboard and misrepresenting the Civil War. Yes, you're up to speed. On July, why

Right? So that brings you up to speed we are now on July 6. July 6, is a fucked up show. It's mostly phone calls. Alex is sort of in a weird headspace. And I don't think he really wants to do his show. And so he takes a lot of phone calls. And they're all pretty boring, right. But in the times that he's not taking phone calls, it's a lot of race ship. He talks a lot about

There's two issues, that there's Donald Trump's situation gives us a window into I don't trust Donald Trump, as far as I could throw an elephant. Everybody knows that. That said, most of what he says makes a lot of sense. And I think he's a really smart guy. And the problem is he won't deliver on what he says he's going to do. In my experience. He is an establishment shill. That's just what my gut tells me and what I've seen what a lot of insiders like Dr. corsi and others say,

That's still what's going on. Right? That's the only context that he covers Trump in pretty much. I think throughout the entirety of this episode, we're going to be going over so anytime there's the Trump situation, it's all just this, which at this point in history on July 6, is old.

And the other one we'll get to later. The reasonable theory is I think that Alex Jones is at some point around here, July sixth, seventh, and that sort of span, he starts to get really jealous, because Donald Trump is getting a lot of press saying things that are very similar to things he says, okay, all right. I think Alex Jones starts to get pretty petty and jealous about like, why is everyone lumping me in with him? Why am I not getting all the attention, that sort of thing? And then on top of that, I think he starts to empathize with him a little bit, because of the way the media treats him. I think that there is a there is an identification factor that Alex starts to feel with Trump. Okay, that's the most reasonable theory I have about what gets him to sort of shift over Yeah, I can see that I have an insane theory.

And the the story that the stock market people gave was that it was a technical glitch. He believes that it's the globalists coming in to stop the market from being destroyed. I think the reality is that the thing that we've discussed in the past a bunch is that so much trading is done on a micro scale by robots. And they shut down the markets because these robots would misinterpret things and start selling off shit. And you would have an artificial collapse, right, basically

Tell us about it, Joe? What was on it? Yeah, in the 70s, you know, as I was probably six or seven years old and lived in Anaheim, and you know, that this guy's got a big treat that you got when I went to Disney Land was you know, they had all the rides and they were they were it's been there for a long time. In the smaller kids area, they had the Song of the South bride just chalk this one up. It was a little ride and had all the fun characters and all this and racist or anything. You just saw these fun whimsical characters. So gone by and we went back to Disneyland and are you out there, and it was completely changed. Like I said, Disney Land hardly ever changed their rights. And we asked the school you know, Where's where's this song of South Bronx? Oh, we asked one of the Disney people. Oh, we don't talk about that. Right? Yeah. An experiment taken out. We got to take that out. We got to take out Song of the South. Although they do use the songs from it. I thought one of the most beautiful things about it was no, it's snowing at the feet of the older black man Hill leading these folk stories as our production of course it was ahead of its time in the 1940s I had mixed animation mixed with live action everything.

And I, we can't prove it. 100%. But I would be very surprised if he isn't the intermediary for Roger Stone, and WikiLeaks, right, which is obviously pushing Russian propaganda. Of course, I believe that once Roger Stone gets involved with Alex Jones, you take these dormant feelings that Alex Jones has towards Russian propaganda, and it becomes super amplified. Ah, all of this connection comes together. At the same time. If you look at it, it's so important that all of the major players now aren't in play. They aren't in the mix. So you have Alex with these latent things. The true Alex is the bigot. Right is the male identity stuff is the racism, Avatar of toxic male culture, the distrust of immigrants, those sorts of things are true, Alex, on top of that, eventually you get Roger Stone in there, you get Steve Botanik in there who's not around at all at this point.

And what he's doing is gobbling up all the attention, and then not properly defending his ideas. The guy owns casinos. The guy is tied in with some really shady characters. After he did that whole birth certificate thing, he suddenly got his what was his NBC contract renewed. So that's my feeling on Trump. My gut has never been wrong. Maybe you'll change your heart. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe maybe, maybe a Blue Moon has arrived. But there's a headline Donald Trump has spent years courting Hillary Clinton and other dems. And so that's where I stand. I mean, he's like a cartoon character. People think He's the richest guy in America. He's worth $4 billion. He's a frontman, in my view, for some other more powerful people. Bill and Melinda Gates are worth 78 million on record, Warren Buffett 73 million on record this year in Forbes, their real wealth is in the aggregate trillions. Donald Trump says a lot of great things and things I agree with. But he's shown by his actions, that he's a pretty slimy guy. And like I think people that aren't casinos are flying through. I I've been around it. I've had a chance to be out to Vegas to see some fights, and to be behind the scenes of and we know what's come out in the news about it. And I just I don't even feel good being close to it. I don't want to lecture people about gambling, you want to do it. Go ahead. You want to be a chump Go ahead. If you and your buddies want to gamble over a poker game, that's completely different. That's just making the game fun. I get that too. I have gamble playing poker, my wife, you know, not not high stakes or anything. But the gamble is sort of being competitive in life. Instead of going out on a limb in life. They go out on a limb in just somebody else's rigged game. It's it's a fake paradigm to come into and be screwed. And I think Trump's gamble for high stakes, it ruins a lot of lives. It's mentally ill. That's my opinion. And I think Trump is a predator. I agree with being involved in it. What do you say to that? I agree with

But to be frank, we should have maybe 1000 times the listeners, we have 1000 times. Yeah, probably. I mean, this is important. It really is. He's destroying our world. He literally is. And it's not that people believe Infowars. That's not the problem. The problem is the the, okay, Larry Nichols didn't destroy political discourse. But things he did set in motion, the environment where political discourse has completely destroyed. Yeah, the lies and propaganda that he was the source of about Bill Clinton has tainted the entire American political landscape for the last 20 years. In the same way, Alex Jones isn't directly doing these things that are legitimately going to end up fucking us over. But he has kicked the ball in motion, right. And as much as it's fun to be like, Hey, you didn't do that much. You're not responsible for Trump winning, he played a big role in it. He played an incredibly big role in it, even if you only take into account that he paid 1000s of dollars for people to show up and soy bomb people with Bill Clinton as a rapist shirts, yeah, stuff like that. Like he is indirectly responsible for Trump becoming president. Trump is responsible for getting out of climate change agreements. He's responsible for putting Jeff Sessions in control, who's going to rollback civil rights with police forces. He's responsible for all of these things. And quite frankly, Alex Jones is indirectly responsible for a lot of that stuff. By virtue of the things he did. I don't want him to be responsible for it. Because I like the Alex Jones, who talks about Chick fil A billboards. I think he's an idiot. But I like that guy. I don't, I don't wouldn't want to hang out with him. Not but I like that kind of, I think it's important to have weirdos. And I don't mean weirdo necessarily in the negative. I don't think that a robust media landscape is just straight news, just well documented stuff. You've got to have people out there who are suggesting some of the craziest bullshit, right? Because sometimes they are right. And sometimes you have conversations that can be opened up because of their insanity things that no one else would consider. And Alex Jones years ago was that he still had a lot of bigotry in him. And that's a big problem. But, again, it's still all covered under the First Amendment. I don't think you know, you can point the finger at him and be like, Stop it. You're bad. You can't that's not grounds for kicking him off the air. It's not grounds for arresting him. He's not doing anything illegal. He was that crazy person. And this investigation to me is very personal in some ways. Because not because I identify with him, but because he's not that anymore. He is the mouthpiece that is responsible for civil rights going away. In many cases, he is responsible for whatever woes are going to come to our climate that lead us to be siding with Syria and Nicaragua against every other
