Jordan is still on vacation, so Dan brings in the great Marty DeRosa from the Marty and Sarah Love Wrestling podcast to sit in. In the past, Dan has disappointed Marty by telling him about the times that pro wrestlers Kane and Roddy Piper appeared on InfoWars. Has he found another wrestler popping up as a guest? Of course he has, and it's not Jesse Ventura.
