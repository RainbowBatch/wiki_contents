Today, Dan tells Jordan all about a special report Alex Jones put out on May 22. Topics include:

*Did Alex Jones put a ton of work into getting White House press credentials only to pretend he doesn't want them?
*What happens when you actually listen to Alex's show?

==Tidbits==

*Change from Wine to Novelty Beverages
**Specifically, Dan chooses "comical beverages"

==Detailed Show Notes==

David Knight hosted, and we have a firm "No Propaganda Deliveries Accepted From Boring Uncles" policy, so we turned it off.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2017/5/22/may-22-2017 May 22, 2017]</ref>
