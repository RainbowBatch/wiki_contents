'''Jesse Ventura''' (born '''James George Janos,''' July 15, 1951) is a former pro wrestler, former Governor of Minnesota, former conspiracy TV show host, and someone who’s been a guest on [[Alex Jones]]’ show for many years.

Jesse’s had a storied career and is obviously a complicated guy, but it’s probably a waste of time to get too into him here, mostly because whenever he appears on Alex’s show, he’s a rogue variable and generally argues with Alex, much to the host’s chagrin. Despite this, Alex is happy to have Jesse on his show as often as he can because Jesse is a celebrity and a big name in the world of libertarian politics. All in all, Jesse seems like a pretty cool guy (outside of the weirdness surrounding his lawsuit with Chris Kyle; it's hard to tell what was going on with that).
