}}[[Alex Jones]], [[Owen Shroyer]], and other [[InfoWars]] personalities have made a number of false and defamatory statements about the family members (and especially the parents) of victims of [[Sandy Hook]].

Many of these family members sued Alex Jones and [[Free Speech Systems LLC|Free Speech Systems]] for defamation in 2018. After years of sanctionable behavior by the defendants, Judges in multiple states entered default judgements. As of summer 2022, all of these cases are scheduled to go before juries to determine damages by the end of 2022.
