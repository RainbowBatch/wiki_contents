When they heard that Trump had been indicted, and they had this sense, they learned about from their mother who's who yelled Yes, mother fucker. And it was licensed for them to curse and which I think is I mean, that's what cursing is actually for. Right? Like we try and teach them like cursing is real. So like, you want to curse Trump you can and just to get the sense that even though look, we know that made this arrest may end up helping him it may mountain nothing, whatever. But in this little moment, my kids have grown up with this vile, vile creature had a sense that perhaps sometimes the bullies get theirs?

Maybe that just maybe it's a crazy idea, but maybe it'll work? And it might not. But let's try. I mean, that argument

But if we start prosecuting people who are on our station, then that opens us to possibly being prosecuted. So we'd rather let Trump do whatever it is he wants, so I can steal money from you also.

But sometimes I hear I sometimes I hear young journalist is sort of like saying, This is so unfair, that I have to endure this. And I'm like, this is this is the job we signed up for. No one is saying, hey, you know what, this world is not going to be complete till Charlotte speaks in public, right? Doesn't mean I deserve, you know, death threats or something like that.

And that's not really an excuse, because even knowing him back then I would have done it. But Alex Jones is featured in that Richard Linklater sort of animated movie, right? That's what I knew about him. And I was like, this Kook. And it's sort of an interesting character. He's a conspiracy theorist. I was also on a radio show called Coast to Coast AM Oh, of course, like, Wait night conspiracy theories. And my, my principal back then, and it still applies now. But I want all kinds of people to talk to me oftentimes against their best interests when fascists talk to me. Not going, I'm upfront, you know, it's like,

That was my old pencil. I don't hold it anymore. Actually. I think at times, I also partly I don't hold it because I think back then I would not have said we, I would say there are spots of fascism in America. But I wouldn't say there is a then you know, there's more than one kind of bad under the sun. Right. And this is the sort of thing like when, whenever we describe, you know, of course, Trump is fascist Bush was fascist Clinton was fascist Reagan was fascist now there's more than one kind of bad under the sun. And in fact, those presidents committed incredible harm. But this is fascism, and no now, I mean, like, if not that he would, but if Alex Jones asked me on now, I would not. No, no, I would not do it.

I did give an interview once a couple years later, like, why did you do that? Of course, Michelle Goldberg. And I was like, you know, I'm the one hand that I had that free speech thing going on the other hand, I can't remember which Linklater movie it was I thought that'll be interesting. I like eccentrics. And no. One wanted to talk about what's that thing where people think it's a real thing. The camp in northern California where leads go. And Alex Jones.

    | text      = That's it right. And he went and I had written about this organization that is real. It's not a conspiracy, but they are weirdly secretive. Sure, the fellowship or the family, they run the National Prayer Breakfast. And so that was, you know, that was, that was just bait for him. And he wanted to do that. And he kept on wanting to say, but so and they also do this. And I'm like, no, they don't do that. But they're pretty bad on their own. Yeah, he wasn't so interested in actually the bad things that they did not like reporting, you know, dictators around the world. He was more interested in, you know, I don't know, do they dance naked around the fire in Northern California, which to me would be like, great if those guys would stop with a dictator and all that and have more naked dances better? Right?

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:08:33.000
    | text      = Well, I mean, that's, that's essentially why he does that is that it's useful for him to present the idea that these people are dancing around naked, as opposed to these people who share the ideology that you do, are actively trying to kill you. You know, that kind of thing. It's a lot easier to go one way or the other. I, there's a lot of that on, you know, you've joined a group of well respected people who have accidentally gone on Infowars. Bill Ayers has accidentally got on Infowars. You know, like, it's it's one of those things where you think, Oh, well, I can talk to anybody and then you get blindsided by that. So that was that was fun. What's it like? In 2003? You were you were on to the tip of these people. While you might call them a conspiracy. It's not the conspiracy that you think you're talking about. It's not the drinking blood conspiracy. It's just regular old kind of fascism.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jeff Sharlet
    | timestamp = 00:09:36.000
    | text      = Well, even then, so when I wrote that, I mean, and so this book, the undertow is sort of coming out of this 20 years of reading about right wing movements. And for a lot of that time that I wrote this book called the family and the Netflix series, people can see blah, blah, blah. And that was about a kind of Christian fundamentalism, the oldest Christian conservative political organization, Washington dating back to nine In 35, when they were formed as businessmen who hated the New Deal and saw the Satanic and they wanted to, they wanted to work against organized labor, and they weren't a conspiracy, and this is really important at partly because they didn't so much break the laws. I mean, there is a prominent former congressman right now who was convicted of conspiracy, so he really is for what he was doing with them. But mostly they make laws, right. So like they, you know, one of their early victories was being instrumental in something called Taft Hartley, which really gutted the organized labor movement, and you can organize for that, and I think this is what a lot of the left sometimes doesn't understand about the right the right has social movements to social movement is not. It's a neutral term, right? There's, you know, it's not it's not in itself a good thing. And they were sort of an elite social movement, and then the undertow, I'm sort of, it's almost like they always have this idea of trickle down fundamentalism, right. And when Trump came down that golden escalator and 2015, I looked at him, and I said, this is the kind of leader that this group, this group of congressmen and businessmen have really supported around the world, but they've always had a little bit of a line, they wouldn't go quite for that strong man figure back in United States. And really, I mean, just sort of coming down from the dark heaven of Trump Tower. There he was, and it was like, Oh, this will be a contender because there's so many politicians who all like Chuck Grassley? Yeah, Chuck Grassley was close friends with a dictator in Somalia and arranged for arm support from sodbury. You know, before this, Chuck Grassley, Chuck Grassley was always a right winger, but he actually had this weird kind of integrity. But you knew that he could be come over to Trump, because he'd done it for those around the world. And here it came. And so that was a sort of their trickle down fundamentals and their ideas becoming mainstream. I wouldn't have said at the time, I said, in fact, they're not fascist.

    | timestamp = 00:12:01.000
    | text      = Yeah, they're bad, but they're not fascists. It's Fascism is a word that means something. And they didn't have a cult of personality. Partly because Jesus occupied that space. And while this kind of American power always sort of supported violence, there's been always been a paradox of it, you know, we declare ourselves a city on a hill. We don't openly fetishize the violence to the point of pleasure, Trump changed that he brought those two elements of classical fascism into play. And now, now, I think it's it is a fair descriptor.

    | text      = I mean, there's so many of us though, right? I mean, like, you guys have been focusing on this for a long, long time. And it is true, I'll tell you this, right. When I published that book in 2008, the family and then Obama was elected, I can't tell you how many producers or interviewers will say, Does this really matter anymore? Isn't fundamentalism dead in America? And I've done history and I was like, Look, you can literally go through the media history of America and find that same decoration every five years going back to 1925. And the Scopes Monkey Trial. Yeah. This time I was, you know, I published this book, and it's seen from a slow Civil War is the subtitle and I was sort of scared. I'm like, Oh, God, their views. I'm just gonna go the thing. He's an alarmist. So the good news for me is, reviews are great. They like it. They say this is scary. The bad news for the world is the very people who once would have said this is alarmist or like, Joseph O'Neill writing the New York Times sort of says yeah, this guy spends a lot of time around militia guys and right wingers and so on. And you know, the little to paraphrase, you know, to a hammer, everything looks like a nail, but the problem is, there's a whole lot of nails right now. And so, yeah, good news, bad news.

And it opens with Hara belly, Harry Belafonte. And I think you draw maybe a parallel, I don't know if you made it explicit. But to that being another Undertow, another era of civil war, wherein it is it is all happening beneath the surface, and it draws some people and tears them all the way down, you know. So,

    | text      = So I wanted to I wanted to ask you some questions about that as far as Harry Belafonte goes? I had no idea I mean, I wasn't alive, but I had no idea quite the extent of his popularity and his fame and there's some amazing stories that you tell about that if you if you've got some time
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jeff Sharlet
    | timestamp = 00:15:17.000
    | text      = so yeah, yeah yeah, I saw I started with Belafonte and and with an even lesser known guy now namely haze, but people probably know some of the haze songs like if I had a hammer, maybe heard Peter, Paul and Mary sing it. And so you know, I heard him or I build a tree house. Now, if I had a hammer, I mean, it was a radical song. If I had a hammer, I would smash capitalism is what he meant. And Harry Belafonte, everyone knows that Banana Boat Song day, oh, I can't see you, you know what it's in your head. They like coming to want to go home. Also a radical song landed on the docks in Jamaica, and I started with these guys, because I think they're remarkable human beings. And, and they, they were in the struggle, they overlapped a little bit milling mainly at different times. We Hayes's you know, 30s 40s And Harry's, he's still alive. But you know, he was instrumental to the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s. And to show that the struggle is long, they're both defeated. They don't win, right. Which we know the Civil Rights Movement didn't did not achieve all that wanted, or nearly enough, and he knows that and in his 90s he's an angry man. Yeah, angry all his life, he says, but it's not a matter of where your anger comes from. It's a matter of what you do with it. And what he did with it when he 1956 He was the first guy to sell a million records, not Elvis, which, you know, he points out was like, it was me it was a black man, it was a black immigrant was the first person to sell right a million records.

    | text      = many firsts of Harry Belafonte and and what was interesting to me about that, not just his, the, the first pneus of it, right, famous first and so on. But the way that part of the reason I don't know that is that so many of these icons get smoothed down, you know, I sang Banana Boat Song and if I had a hammer in elementary school, you know that safe song songs and that's part of how we forget, we forget these resources we have for struggle that were there, these freedom songs, and Harry Belafonte News knows that because he was studying the songs and slay people saying that had code in them. And he says all my songs are code songs, and he has a blistering critique of American knife. Two, he says, it's a minstrel act, you know, corked up blackface. The whole country is a minstrel act. He says Even I'm in the minstrel act. This is how America this is the struggle that we are in. And then the third and last point, I guess, would be just, you know, there's a scene Harry Belafonte a Freedom Summer in Mississippi, it's about to wind up the program. 1963 is this I can't remember 64 and three civil rights workers, Goodman Schwerner and Cheney horrifically murdered I mean, there's no non horrific murder, but you know, mutilated, tortured. And so they all decide to stay down there, but they need money. Harry, Harry's the guy who has the money, he's got enough money but he can't wire $50,000 to Mississippi. It's like sending a death when he's got to bring it himself. He goes in and gets Sidney Poitier, the famous actor, first black man to win an Academy as actor. And he says, you know, they can might be scared of killing too big. I'm not gonna use the word he can use word. I can't use the word black men. And the claim was not they landed on the plane. The Klan was waiting. It's a car chase. It's a car chase town and they get there. And I'm like, these struggles these Oathkeepers these these proud boys, these three percenters. There's more of them now there really are. But we fought them before and we gotta remember that. You know, I

He knew this kind of predator natural sense of time he had. He's a person of incredible charisma and incredible command. And he never wavered for a second of knowing what he wanted to use it for, which was freedom, which was not just for himself, but for others. And he sees these guys, these prisoners, he stopped the clock in prison and I think, you know, we look Harry Belafonte. The interesting thing too, is I'll do another interview the other day is like, what kind of leaders do we need now? I don't think of Harry Belafonte. As a leader. I think of Harry Belafonte, in the tradition of another great civil rights activist, Fannie Lou Hamer, strong people, she says, don't need strong leaders. Harry Belafonte was thinking, you know, I want to bring you into this space with me, we are going to do this thing together. I'm not going to direct you. It doesn't work. This is he's on a solidarity model is only works if we're in solidarity with one another. And so thank you for opening with that. Because you know, this book is pretty dark. And that's sort of why.

And that's kind of the thing like I, I was reminded of Audrey Lorde. Whenever I was reading that Harry Belafonte story like that the Masters tools cannot dismantle the Masters House. And that's where I kept going back to financiers. Like it is so strange to me that in order to continue this revolution, you need a financier to drive down with 50 grand in cash. You know, like, in that case, there's such a logjam where you can kill the whole operation? Do you know what I mean? So as far as these these revolutions go, you know, you look at that, and you see the failures that result from it. And it says to me that this cannot be the way that it's done.

Or as, as that Pastor did, he had a customized ar 15 He was given by his church with Joshua one nine inscribed on it, which has now become this popular, so called Battle verse of, for certain conservative evangelicals, the birth itself is is you know, be brave. Take heart, right. You know, it's not objective, but you got to another and I suspect you do know the rest of the Joshua's story.

And I don't know if you are familiar with that one, but it's essentially let a woman learn and all submissiveness I permit no woman to have authority over man, because Adam was before Eve right?

Because that's yes or no, do or don't, you know, now she had that Bible verse, she had it, read at a church, by the pastor before God, right.

It's a Christian nationalism of the moment. And I think this is in 2013. I report in Russia on this is just when Putin was beginning to use queer folks, LGBTQ plus folks, as the enemy within which he had actually been quite progressive before that, but he's like, I need to organize an enemy within and, and so. And he appealed as he has ever since to this kind of sense of a holy Christian mission of Russia. And Russians loved it. So like, there's people who sort of think, Gosh, I don't hate the Russian people. I hate Putin. Well, bad news. A lot of Russian people really like Putin. And, but not because they went to church, the church attendance is like single digits. You know, same with the larger movement around Trump right now, almost, except for the people I meet in churches. Most of the other people in this book, militia men, guys with guns, angry folks, they want, they want a Christian nation. They don't go to church. They don't know what that is. What they mean by Christianity is a kind of vision of whiteness. And you know, you could say like, you reject the word Christian. A phrase I use it Another book I hoped would catch on it didn't. I said, I think we should call it American fundamentalism. It's not Christian fundamentalism. That's a good one because it is all wrapped up in mythology. It's wrapped up in movies. I write a lot about movies. And this book is not it's not an academic study. It's because I mean to a January 6 insurrection is named George Riley. He He's angry because Richard Barnett, I think who put his shoes up on Nancy Pelosi, his desk gets all the credit. He says, just because no one got a picture of me. I pulled down my pants and rubbed my ass on her desk. Yeah, how come I don't get the credit? He is getting prosecuted, but but he says how to understand who he is. You said Did you see the movie 300 Zack Snyder bloodfest 300 Spartans against Persian hordes. He says, unlike that guy, one one man survives. And I'm like, actually, most of you survived January 6, he said, Last Man Standing to tell Ashley Babbitt's story. Sure. He doesn't even write down to the Civil War when they say Civil War. All of us as Americans, unless we're born somewhere else, or have done some war reporting. We don't we're talking about a metaphor.

These guys, there are real issues that they could raise, like, suicide is wildly higher amongst men, and you could talk about incarceration, we could talk about poverty, draft and all these kinds of things. Instead, they get together and these are the people that we now know is in cells, and they talk about their, their ex wives and ex girlfriends and the girlfriends they never had. I was out there with them.

Because that misogyny became the ethos of the Republican Party. Not just the sexism that had always been there but I look at there's a chapter in the book traveling around Wisconsin after Dobbs after the downfall of of Roe. And talking Wisconsin became the the only blue state where abortion was completely illegal, reverted the 1849 law. And it's also happens to be kind of a militia state. A lot of folks out there, it's well armed state, as is Vermont where I live. I'm not casting aspersions. Sure. But what was interesting when I would talk to these men about abortion, and they saw it as a great victory. These were not pious dudes at all. And it's almost like outlawing abortion was not really about saving the babies. It was about saving the babies in their their mind. But also we know it's about controlling women. And then I think they experienced it as almost sort of sexually exciting. There was a guy named Brian Bushman, he was celebrating the day I met him, his much younger wife was sort of, she's sitting down and an old woman, the old woman and his younger girlfriend, stand up so he and his buddy can sit down to talk, right? You know, just the the man spread, sits there with his beverage. I don't know what's in it. He's, he's pretty tipsy, I think in talking about this. And his, his, his, his girl there. I'm calling her girls, she's a woman, but this is what she's been. She has to stand submissively behind him and giggle at the most vulgar things that these guys are saying.

And it is a sublimation realistically of their admittance that they have it coming. Right. So here's what you're saying. When you're a white man claiming to be a victim, you're saying that, I admit, if these things were done, then this is a reasonable response. Right? Yeah. So what you're saying is, if I did those things, it is reasonable for black people to murder me the way that I am saying, I have the right to for them, they're telling on themselves. Now, the problem there is nobody really wants to murder them. And that's the issue, you know. But that's, that's, that's one of the one of the things that I wanted to get into.
