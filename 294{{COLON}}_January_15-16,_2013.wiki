Today, Dan and Jordan get back to the past to continue looking into what [[Alex Jones]] was doing in the days after [[The Sandy Hook Elementary Massacre|Sandy Hook]]. Not a whole lot to learn about Alex's opinion on the shooting this episode, but the gents do get to talk a bit about Alex planning tax fraud with his neighbor, "the Illuminati card game," and Alex recommending a book that Timothy McVeigh liked even more than the Turner Diaries.
