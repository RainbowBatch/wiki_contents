'''Cameron Atkinson''' (Cam for short) is a Connecticut attorney who has represented [[Alex Jones]] in the [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|Connecticut Sandy Hook Case]]. He describes himself as "a Christian, a trial and appellate lawyer at [[Norm Pattis|Pattis]] & Smith, LLC, a former business consultant, a published constitutional scholar, and a general hell-raiser"<ref>https://cameronlatkinson.com/</ref>.

Cam has an online merchandise store where he sells extremely confusing merchandise, including a "Say No To The Liberated Whores Mafia" Women's T-Shirt<ref>https://cameronlatkinson.com/product/say-no-to-the-liberated-whores-mafia-womens-t-shirt/</ref>. He calls himself a "published constitutional scholar" because he wrote a single law review explaining why everyone justified police officers having sex the wrong way. His email signature has been a link to this review since at least 2019.

Cam has (unsuccessfully) argued a number of motions before [[Judge Barbara Bellis]], including a notable flurry of hearings when Alex tried to get out of his Connecticut deposition by pretending to be sick. He is often unprepared to argue the topics the judge has scheduled.
