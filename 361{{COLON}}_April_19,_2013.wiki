Today, Dan and Jordan return to their examination of the past, and see how Alex Jones covered the unfolding events after the bombing at the Boston Marathon. In this installment, the city of Boston is under a shelter-in-place request as the surviving bomber is on the loose, which seems like it should be right in Alex's wheelhouse. Perhaps too in his wheelhouse.
