To be blunt, Mika Brzezinski is the personification of everything Alex Jones detests. 

In Episode #110, Alex is specifically worked-up about Trump launching investigations into people's backgrounds.  This includes investigating the death of an intern who worked for Joe Scarborough during his time as a GOP representative from Florida.

Alex plays a clip from ''Morning Joe'' where Mika and Joe spoke against Trump.  The co-hosts said that Trump ran for office because he needed money (and that he is still "all about money").  Alex is angry that they reported incorrect poll results during the campaign.  They also discuss how Trump ordered Michael Flynn to meet with Russia.
