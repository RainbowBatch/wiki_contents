'''Dennis Montgomery''' is a perennial American con-artist who has popped up in a variety of InfoWars adjacent contexts over the last 20 years.

Montgomery gained prominence after selling a number of dubious programs to the US government in the early 2000s. Montgomery claimed his software could decode hidden "barcodes" from Al Qaeda in Al Jazeera TV broadcasts. Phony alerts based on Montgomery's programs caused flight groundings, evacuations, and fluctuations in the US "Terror Level" metric<ref>https://www.theregister.com/2009/12/24/cia_montgomery/</ref>.

Once the government figured out they were being scammed and dropped their $30M dollar contract<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20080403124707/http://www.nvtoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=246&Itemid=1</ref> with his company eTreppid, Montgomery began to involve himself in a series of increasingly bizarre and desperate scams. Montgomery continues to derive a lot of credibility from this contract, and has at various times claimed he continues to do classified work for the federal government, although there is no evidence of work with the government post the eTreppid scam.

In 2006, Montgomery falsely claimed to have evidence that a member of Congress was taking bribes (He claimed to have obtained this evidence during his work on eTreppid). That member countered that Montgomery had fabricated evidence. The allegations were not substantiated after investigation by the DOJ and FBI<ref>http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-11-03-nevada-governor_N.htm</ref>.

Starting sometime around 2014, Montgomery became associated with [[Joe Arpaio]]. Montgomery falsely claimed that he had evidence that could prove that the ongoing racial profiling lawsuit against Arpaio was a politically motivated conspiracy by the Judge and Department of Justice (He claimed to have obtained this information during his work with the CIA). Montgomery and Arpaio then did some very illegal things to try and "prove" that the judge and or the judge's wife was dirty. Arpaio later admitted that Montgomery's claims were "junk"<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/us/twists-outnumber-judges-so-far-in-case-against-arizona-sheriff-joe-arpaio.html</ref>. The whole incident is also related to how Montgomery first came up on the show, listen to [[25: Dennis Montgomery Investigation]] for more details.

During the Trump years, Montgomery claimed to have evidence (obtained during his supposed work with the CIA) that [[Donald Trump]] and [[Jerome Corsi]] were under illegal surveillance by the federal government. By this point you may be able to guess that these claims were not substantiated on further investigation<ref>https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/04/05/conspiracy-theory-joe-arpaio-barack-obama-birth-certificate-donald-trump-wiretap-claims/99761074/</ref>.

After the [[2020 Presidential Election]], Montgomery was the source of a prominent conspiracy theory ([[Hammer and Scorecard]]), and was closely associated with [[Mike Lindell]]. Montgomery's story sometimes varied in its specifics, but the core claims remained the same: Montgomery claimed that during his work with the CIA, he had built a supercomputer named "Hammer" and written surveillance software named "Scorecard".  He further falsely claimed that elements of the [[Deep State]] had hijacked the system and were using it to switch votes. Montgomery, of course, claimed to have evidence of all this that he had obtained during his work with the feds.

Despite the laughable nature of a lot of these tales, variants of Hammer and Scorecard spread rapidly within the far right. Prominent election deniers with connections to the White House, like [[Sidney Powell]], parroted the theories in prominent interviews on [[FOX News]] and other national forums, lending them additional credibility.
