Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened on a very bizarre March 1st episode of the Alex Jones Show. Topics include:

*Can Dan and Jordan find some unexpected common ground with Alex?
*Can they find multiple points of agreement with Alex?
*Does Alex believe that "white racism" exists?

Plus, enjoy a bonus episode recorded on Feb 6, where Dan tells "Replacement Jordan" Marty DeRosa about what Alex's Super Bowl Sunday show was like.
