The Genesis Communication Network, or GCN, is a talk radio network based in Minnesota but broadcasting across the US.

[[Alex Jones]] has been on GCN since it was founded, and it is its most prominent personality.

GCN was founded in 1998 by [[Ted Anderson]] as a way to promote [[Midas Resources]], his now-defunct precious metals business. GCN hosts would drum up fear and panic in their listeners through right-wing propaganda, then direct them towards Midas Resources as a safe way to buy gold and other precious metals that would allegedly be worth more when society collapsed.

GCN was a defendant (represented by [[Mario Cerame]]) in the [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|CT Sandy Hook Lawsuit]], but was removed as a defendant shortly before the case went to trial. It's not clear if this was because GCN settled out of court, or if plaintiffs voluntary withdrew the suit for other reasons.
