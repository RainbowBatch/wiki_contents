It is a daily 3-hour show (which sometimes extends into a 4th hour, often hosted by a guest or other InfoWars employee).

The show is usually (but not always) hosted by [[Alex Jones]] and typically features him lying about the day's news articles. Clips from the show are typically the main content covered by [[Knowledge Fight]].
