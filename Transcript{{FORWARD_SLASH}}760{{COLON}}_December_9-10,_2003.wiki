Again, I've gotten voluminous prestigious medical reports on that. And now they're trying to fear monger with that weapon. I will remind you that West Nile was given to Saddam in 1984 by Donald Rumsfeld and the Commerce Department. So we have that as well. And this was how they're gonna get their control. Oh, we're just giving you martial law for your safety. General Everhart at NORTHCOM command in Colorado Springs has said the former CENTCOM head Tommy Franks has said

    | timestamp = 00:26:48.000
    | text      = he was at the Commerce Department because it's commerce. So there's a really interesting dynamic to the game that right wing propagandist shitheads like Alex have to engage in that I'd like to call out a little bit here. In order to run their game of constantly making the audience afraid about novel and exciting threats. They're required to rewrite their own past ideas for Alex to compellingly freak out his listeners about COVID being a lab made bio weapon and 2020 It's pretty important for him to not give off the impression that he's just the kind of guy that says that all the time, he would lose a lot of his ability to convince them that he's proven that the sky is falling if they were made aware of how many times he claimed to have proven that in the past, but he's really just making shit up. So in 2020, the 2003 SARS outbreak is real in service of helping Alex make the argument that the current one is not if things have gotten out of control in 2003 in the way they did. In our present, Alex would have played a similar anti Vax game as he has recently. But it wouldn't have been nearly as impactful given his far smaller influence and the dynamics around social media not being there at the time. The model State Emergency Powers Act was a piece of draft legislation that was crafted by a Georgetown Law Professor With support from the CDC. It was not ever adopted or passed on a federal level though some state governments have passed elements of it. For instance, in March 2003, Arizona passed a bill requiring the Department of Health Services to redact personally and identifying info from health records before they're released publicly. Now, a couple of the state bills do provide a clarification of what law enforcement entities can do to assist with Department of Health orders involving quarantines. But it's a far cry from anything like martial law or what Alex is saying. Yeah, plus, this is the state government so states rights are something also Alex fails to mention that his mortal enemy The ACLU is an entity leading the opposition to the model State Emergency Powers Act due to concerns about vague language that could lead to civil liberty infringement. Alex just ignores that because it would make it harder for him to paint them as the evil demon globalists to his audience if he acknowledged what they actually do. Right. Alex is further mixing up his history. Saddam used chemical weapons on civilians in 1984. But the shipments of West Nile were made in 1985. They weren't specifically to Saddam, and they weren't made by Rumsfeld. But they did happen. There was an Iraqi scientist who had previously been a researcher in Fort Collins, Colorado who received shipments of West Nile presumably for lab research purposes. There's a huge conversation that deserves to be had and has been had but maybe could be had more about the unintended consequences of dual use chemical agents that were sold to Iraq for research purposes before Desert Storm, right but that actual conversation has almost nothing to do with West Nile and Alex is all over the place. But to the extent that you know, our soldiers did end up you know, finding these these old agents and stuff and being affected by them. Yeah. Is on acceptable Yeah, no, no. or find

There were relatively few deaths from the 2002 outbreak of SARS, but a lot of that probably comes down to there being a robust response to it and us getting lucky. Alex is just a little bit off on that flu story, too. In 1998, researchers found fragments of the 1918 flu in six on Earth bodies from the Norwegian Arctic Arctic, that flu is one that really scares scientists, because it wasn't really clear why it was so deadly and how it moves so fast. Research on that end of things is tough because there aren't exactly a ton of preserved samples of the flu that people couldn't just work with. Thus, the goal was to find some bodies who might have contained the virus but got really deep frozen, which led people to the Arctic, right.

But they had contracted the flu on the boat trip from the mainland and died in the first week of October 1918. It is a fascinating story. But ultimately, they did not find samples that could be used for research since the bodies turned out to have not actually been buried in permafrost, as they had expected, right. If Alex was following this story, he probably should have known about this by 2003. But in reality, the details of the story aren't useful to him.

In the third hour of the show, I have one of the lawyers for the young people at Goose Creek public school where the police did a what can only be described as a Nazi or Soviet style martial law raid. These have actually been going on around the country for about 10 years becoming more frequent, but big brother's own surveillance turned against them. And now part of the video that wasn't released has been released and it shows the dog the German Shepherd savaging their backpacks, grabbing the backpack, shaking its head, stepping and stomping and jumping on the terrified children.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:56:59.000
    | text      = So this story sucks. It's tragedy, and I'm going to guess that Alex is going to miss the forest for the trees talking about it because he always does. Yeah. On November 5 2003, the police in Goose Creek, South Carolina conducted a raid on students at Stratford high school after the principal decided that one student was possibly selling weed, the student body of the school was less than 25% African American, but over quote, a more than two thirds of those caught up in the sweep were African American. Ultimately, no drugs or weapons were found and no charges were ever filed. Great. A cynical view of things might lead one to assume that the only reason that this became a story at all is because there was surveillance video of the raid itself. And this is kind of Bleak shit to imagine that this could conceivably be happening in other schools. Yeah, and what that must be like, one of the reasons that this story proceeded, the way that it did is because 20 of the students who were the subject of this raid, were represented by the ACLU, who had the resources to take this all the way to a settlement, which changed the way that the school district handled searches and established a fund for the students who are victimized cover medical expenses, and therapy. This lawyer that Alex has on is a member of a legal team that is also representing some students, and that's great as well. So much of this comes down to a conversation about race. And I think it's pretty clear that Alex isn't going to address that. One of the reasons that this case is particularly suspicious was the timing of the raid which took place at 6:45am. The reason this is suspicious is because that was prior to the arrival time of most of the schools, buses. The only buses that had arrived were the ones that picked up students who lived relatively close, which was a group that was predominantly black. In essence, the school intentionally or not created a situation where the primarily white students would arrive at school to a scene of mostly black students being searched and made to kneel while police held them at gunpoint. It's a dehumanizing scene and the race aspect of it is pretty much impossible to ignore. But we'll see how Alex tries

    | text      = Also, at no point in the article doesn't say that the dog whose name is Major, they don't say that it's a trained attack dog. Yeah, this is at best Alex lying about a part in the article that describes the difference between passive and active alert detection dogs. Some dogs respond to finding drugs by sitting, which is the passive training and some will bark, which is the more aggressive style. Alex is either lying about this, or just making up a detail to create an angle for the audience to hang on to that doesn't involve the clear racism that underlies this story. Everything about the raid and the search sucks. And I'm not minimizing any of that stuff. I'm just saying that Alex is not a good source of information on anything. If you have the article he's reporting on in front of you, and you watch along as ALEX READS, it often becomes really clear how his process works. He's basically just skimming along and finding words to use as anchor points. And in this case, Czechoslovakia is a pretty glaring and embarrassing one. This behavior is constant and consistent throughout his career. So generally, if people listened to Alex, it's probably best for them to double check his work. So you can tell how much of it is just he's making up to sound smarter and more interesting. Well, putting literally zero effort into doing any show prep. Because why would you? Yeah, yeah, that's he knows that the shit that he's saying isn't true. So why put time into preparing?

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 01:16:51.000
    | text      = This is just bullying that Alex is doing. Alex has rehearsed talking points about Northwoods, which he uses to lend undeserved support to his conspiracies about things like 911 and the then recent beltway sniper attacks aren't going to stand up to a person just reading the document. This is dicey territory. So Alex has to do two things that you see demonstrated in that clip. The first thing is the absurd victory that He claims over this collar. Alex claims that the document says that the globalists paramilitary forces will shoot people in DC and Miami and then explains how to set up patsies this isn't really accurate. The document talks about developing a communist Cuban terror plot quote pointed at Cuban refugees seeking haven in the United States. This wouldn't involve killing anyone or any paramilitary groups, although it does say it may involve up to wounding Ooh. They also say that, quote, the arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents, substantiating Cuban involvement would be helpful in projecting the idea of an irresponsible government. This is fairly close to discussing how to blame a patsy. But it's unclear if the Cuban agents they're referring to actually be blamed for anything. Or if the goal would just be to arrest some agents in order to create public perception that they should be to blame. Or there's even parts of this plan that suggest using Cuban friendlies in order to pretend to be Cuban communists in order to make it look like they were attacking something right. So these Cuban agents might even be dummies, they're talking the whole cockamamie plan. Yeah, it's splitting hairs a little bit here. So I'm gonna go ahead and give Alex half credit, the document does suggest creating false perception about who's to blame for false fake attacks, whatever. The caller then reads the part about syncing real or simulated ship of refugees. And I suspect that Alex knows that this is as close as he's gonna get to a win. So he pretends that this fully supports what he just claimed. But it doesn't. Alex needs this appearance of a win in order to protect the air of frustration, and that he's always right when people question him. This goes a long way towards the second aspect of this clip. Putting that in motion, which is to force the caller to accept the notion that everything is vague. And because of that all of Alex's unsupported and extreme conclusions are actually what the document saying, Yeah, it's a demand that the caller read the words on the page that aren't there, because Alex insists that they are. And it's something that the audience watches and on some level, they probably understand. Yeah, Alex understands reality better than you do. So you need to subvert your reality to him. It is a very bizarre and scary message.

And this caller, he has ended up being there for some calls. It's pretty unfortunate, because the the lawyer himself is black man. And he brings up the dynamic that's at play with the video recording of the actual raid, being similar in terms to the Rodney King beating right in terms of people being able to see the actual thing elicits an emotional response that people experience it far more vividly than things that they can only abstractly think about. Then the number of callers call in and say How dare you compare this to Rodney King, he was a horrible criminal here it is all this air it was he has to explain. And it's not what I meant.
