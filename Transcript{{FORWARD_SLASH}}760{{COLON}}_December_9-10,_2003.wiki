Now this is the this is the model state's health Emergency Powers Act the force inoculation program the CFR was saying they were going to use smallpox for sure to hit Dallas, Cleveland and Denver according to CFR head fear monger, Gary Hart of the Hart-Rubin commission. You've probably seen him on television. He said we would be hit last year but 99 plus percent of police, firefighters and medical workers refused to take it, so now they've had to move on to SARS, which has been looked at very closely, is genetically engineered has been altered by humans. Again, I've gotten voluminous prestigious medical reports on that. And now they're trying to fear monger with that weapon. I will remind you that West Nile was given to Saddam in 1984 by Donald Rumsfeld and the Commerce Department. So we have that as well. And this is how they're gonna get their control. Oh, we're just giving you martial law for your safety. General Everhart at NORTHCOM command in Colorado Springs has said the former CENTCOM head Tommy Franks has said.

    | timestamp = 00:26:50.000
    | text      = So there's a really interesting dynamic to the game that right wing propagandist shitheads like Alex have to engage in that I'd like to call out a little bit here. In order to run their game of constantly making the audience afraid about novel and exciting threats, they're required to rewrite their own past ideas. For Alex to compellingly freak out his listeners about COVID being a lab-made bio weapon in 2020, it's pretty important for him to not give off the impression that he's just the kind of guy that says that all the time. He would lose a lot of his ability to convince them that he's proven that the sky is falling if they were made aware of how many times he claimed to have proven that in the past, but he's really just making shit up. So in 2020, the 2003 SARS outbreak is real in service of helping Alex make the argument that the current one is not. If things had gotten out of control in 2003 in the way they did in our present, Alex would have played a similar anti Vax game as he has recently. But it wouldn't have been nearly as impactful given his far smaller influence and the dynamics around social media not being there at the time. The model State Emergency Powers Act was a piece of draft legislation that was crafted by a Georgetown Law Professor With support from the CDC. It was not ever adopted or passed on a federal level though some state governments have passed elements of it. For instance, in March 2003, Arizona passed a bill requiring the Department of Health Services to redact personally and identifying info from health records before they're released publicly. Now, a couple of the state bills do provide a clarification of what law enforcement entities can do to assist with Department of Health orders involving quarantines, but it's a far cry from anything like martial law or what Alex is saying. Yeah, plus, this is the state government so states rights or something... Also, Alex fails to mention that his mortal enemy, the ACLU, is an entity leading the opposition to the model State Emergency Powers Act due to concerns about vague language that could lead to civil liberty infringement. Alex just ignores that because it would make it harder for him to paint them as the evil demon globalists to his audience if he acknowledged what they actually do.

There was an Iraqi scientist who had previously been a researcher in Fort Collins, Colorado who received shipments of West Nile presumably for lab research purposes.

There were relatively few deaths from the 2002 outbreak of SARS, but a lot of that probably comes down to there being a robust response to it and us getting lucky. Alex is just a little bit off on that flu story, too. In 1998, researchers found fragments of the 1918 flu in six unearthed bodies from the Norwegian Arctic... Arctic, that flu is one that really scares scientists, because it wasn't really clear why it was so deadly and how it moved so fast. Research on that end of things is tough because there aren't exactly a ton of preserved samples of the flu that people could just work with. Thus, the goal was to find some bodies who might have contained the virus but got really deep frozen, which led people to the Arctic.

These have actually been going on around the country for about 10 years becoming more frequent, but big brother's own surveillance turned against them. And now part of the video that wasn't released has been released and it shows the dog the German Shepherd savaging their backpacks, grabbing the backpack, shaking its head, stepping and stomping and jumping on the terrified children.

Ultimately, no drugs or weapons were found and no charges were ever filed.

    | timestamp = 00:57:51.000
    | text      = And what that must be like, one of the reasons that this story proceeded, the way that it did is because 20 of the students who were the subject of this raid, were represented by the ACLU, who had the resources to take this all the way to a settlement, which changed the way that the school district handled searches and established a fund for the students who were victimized to cover medical expenses, and therapy. This lawyer that Alex has on is a member of a legal team that is also representing some students, and that's great as well. So much of this comes down to a conversation about race. And I think it's pretty clear that Alex isn't going to address that. One of the reasons that this case is particularly suspicious was the timing of the raid which took place at 6:45am. The reason this is suspicious is because that was prior to the arrival time of most of the school's buses. The only buses that had arrived were the ones that picked up students who lived relatively close, which was a group that was predominantly black. In essence, the school, intentionally or not, created a situation where the primarily white students would arrive at school to a scene of mostly black students being searched and made to kneel while police held them at gunpoint. It's a dehumanizing scene and the race aspect of it is pretty much impossible to ignore. But we'll see how Alex tries.

Everything about the raid and the search sucks. And I'm not minimizing any of that stuff. I'm just saying that Alex is not a good source of information on anything. If you have the article he's reporting on in front of you, and you watch along as Alex reads, it often becomes really clear how his process works. He's basically just skimming along and finding words to use as anchor points. And in this case, Czechoslovakia is a pretty glaring and embarrassing one. This behavior is constant and consistent throughout his career, so generally, if people listen to Alex, it's probably best for them to double check his work, so you can tell how much of it is just shit he's making up to sound smarter and more interesting.

Alex has rehearsed talking points about Northwoods, which he uses to lend undeserved support to his conspiracies about things like 911 and the then recent beltway sniper attacks aren't going to stand up to a person just reading the document. This is dicey territory. So Alex has to do two things that you see demonstrated in that clip. The first thing is the absurd victory that He claims over this collar. Alex claims that the document says that the globalists paramilitary forces will shoot people in DC and Miami and then explains how to set up patsies. This isn't really accurate. The document talks about developing a communist Cuban terror plot quote pointed at Cuban refugees seeking haven in the United States. This wouldn't involve killing anyone or any paramilitary groups, although it does say it may involve up to wounding.

This is fairly close to discussing how to blame a patsy, but it's unclear if the Cuban agents they're referring to would actually be blamed for anything, or if the goal would just be to arrest some agents in order to create public perception that they should be to blame, or there's even parts of this plan that suggest using Cuban friendlies in order to pretend to be Cuban communists in order to make it look like they were attacking something. So these Cuban agents might even be dummies, that they're talking about, essentially.

Alex needs this appearance of a win in order to protect the air of frustration, and that he's always right when people question him. This goes a long way towards the second aspect of this clip.
