'''Judge Andrew Napolitano''' is a former state supreme court judge, attorney, and legal analyst for [[FOX News]]. He has appeared as an [[InfoWars]] guest, lending his credibility to some truly crazy conspiracy theories. Somehow, despite completely jumping the shark during his early 2010s appearances with [[Alex Jones]], Napolitano managed to become a remain influential legal commentator for FOX news during [[Donald Trump]]'s presidency.
