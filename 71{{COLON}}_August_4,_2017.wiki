Today, Jordan is about to embark on a vacation overseas, but before he goes, Dan has to tell him all about what has been going on lately on The Alex Jones Show. He briefly touches on the nonsense Alex has been selling about Seth Rich, but most of the episode has to do with a deeply, deeply troubling interview Alex conducts on the Friday installment of his show, where he disseminates pro-Putin propaganda.

==Tidbits==

*Jordan is going on vacation to Iceland. Seth Rich conspiracies. Alex is ISIS. $17.76 sale. Dugin kisses Alex's ass / manipulates Alex. "Trump is American Putin" - AJ, lots of that. Mike Cernovich pivots 360.

==References==

*"The 4th Political Theory" and other Dugin books.
