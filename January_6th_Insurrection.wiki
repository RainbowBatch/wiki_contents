On January 6th, 2021, supporters of then President [[Donald Trump]] violently attacked the US Capitol building in an attempt to delay or prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election, leading to numerous injuries and deaths.

While [[Alex Jones]] did not enter the Capitol, he was present in DC on the 6th and attended a number of the events that frothed Trump supporters up enough to riot. He spent months making increasingly violent and apocalyptic claims on [[InfoWars]], and absolutely bears some moral responsibility for what happened, although unlike some of his guests (e.g. [[Joe Biggs]]) he does not appear to have been directly involved in planning the attack.

Before the scope of the violence became clear, Alex made a series of grandiose claims about how he had brought people to DC and he was leading people to the Capitol at Trump's request. Once violence actually kicked off, Alex quickly ran away to the safety of his hotel, making up blatant falsehoods about the event as it happened in an attempt to downplay it. [[Owen Shroyer]], who was with Jones during the riot, was later charged with being on Capitol grounds in violation of a prior agreement arising from his conduct during the [[Brett Kavanaugh|Kavanaugh]] confirmation hearings, but neither man entered the buildings.

[[Ashli Babbitt]], one of the insurrectionists, was shot when she attempted to rush the Speaker's Lobby through a smashed window. Alex initially lied about Babbitt's injury, claiming without basis that she was injured less severely than she actual was (at the time, he was still downplaying the violence and significance of the attack).

[[385: January 6, 2020|Episode 385]] discusses InfoWars contemporaneous coverage of the attack.
