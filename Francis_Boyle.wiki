'''Dr. Francis Boyle''' is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Boyle</ref>. While he has appeared on [[InfoWars]] for years, Boyle became especially prominent in 2020, when he because a core guest to justify Alex's false claims that Covid was a Bioweapon.

Boyle claims credibility on "bioweapon" related issues because he helped to draft the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989<ref>https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/993/text</ref>. This is at first glance super impressive, however it's important to keep in mind that this Act was the US implementing the global [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention Biological Weapons Convention], the writing of which Boyle was not involved in. Boyle's work was still important to ratifying the convention., but Boyle has no expertise or academic degree in virology, biology, or any other relevant field.

Boyle has a long-history of advocating for indigenous peoples, going so far as to condemn the US Federal Government for their treatment of Native peoples. He has advocated for Hawaiian Independence since at least 1993. These are all very positive things, until it gets to the point where he argues that the Federal Government is operating out of a "grotesque vision of a New World Order," which goes a long ways to explain why a guy who supports oppressed populations would appear on InfoWars.
