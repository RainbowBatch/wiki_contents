He said that Robert Welsh and the JBS were targeted by the ADL and the CIA and this was declassified last week. In reality, what happened was that last week, Alex skimmed a headline of an article about a historian who was interviewed about a book he'd put out recently, the book was about the John Birch Society, and one chapter had to do with the fact that some of the members of the ADL had infiltrated the JBS, on fact finding missions. Nothing was declassified, and the CIA wasn't in cahoots with AD, these ADL members who went undercover. This is a slippery way that Alex USE his language to exaggerate his own oppression and the oppression of his ideological allies. And the way he tries to dress it up in the appearance of officialdom. It sounds so much cooler to say, the CIA was targeting his buddies, and that this was declassified, as opposed to how dorky it sounds to complain about an interview with an author that you didn't even read. You didn't read the book. You didn't read the interview? And you didn't read the article about the interviewer?

No, this author had found some documents in the Jewish Historical Society's archive, right. It wasn't declassified, it was known at the beginning, it was it was in a bar. Right. And this calls into question you should keep in mind every time Alex says things are declassified. Sure. This is the kind of thing he's willing to call declassified, because it elevates and serves his purposes to do so. Sure. Now, second, you've got to recognize what the point of this is. And that is, the feature of this is defending the John Birch Society sort of, and that is because his argument is that the ABL agents infiltrated and then got all racist in order to make the JBS look race

And that is that it also now applies to every other racist group that he's super cool with. Yeah, you know, like, yeah, all of these groups that are, you know, carrying out exercises and, and, you know, are definitely threats to commit domestic violence and terrorism. Sure. People like the Patriot front, are now just proven it's been declassified, that the ADL just infiltrated the Patriot front and did all this Nazi stuff in order to create the appearance that they're actually a Nazi group.

This account posted the small excerpt of Welch's speech on Twitter on May 26, and then re tweeted it a couple days later. So Alex clearly saw it and decided to run with it as a news item because he's dumb and lazy. Also, not for nothing. This account also tweeted out a video with a caption quote, since the veterans day is almost over, I just want you to always remember this message. Then there's a like an American flag emoji veterans days in November, right? Anyway, this this account is just a constant barrage of right wing culture war type whining about things like how corporations are too woke because they celebrate Pride and they also seem to be really mad about Black Lives Matter. Yeah. Also a small point, this speech wasn't from 1958. It's a recording from 1974. But the title on the YouTube video that I'm memes zero is taking this from the title is quote, Robert Welch speech parentheses greatest speech in America in 1958. These people haven't even watched the source material, the pulling this from or know anything about the subject, the dead giveaway is should be won. The actual speech is titled 15 years ago, referring to the founding of the John Birch Society being 15 years in the past in 1958. And this is also a speech that Welch originally gave in 1973. So that's why it's 15 years. Okay. 16.

Okay, so that's what this is. Claiming that it's from 1958. The memes are claiming that memes are claiming, yes, yeah. And then Alex is just repeating because he doesn't know anything about this, right. The second dead giveaway should be that the emcee for this event is John McManus, who's credited as the Director of Public Relations. McManus would go on to be the president of the John Birch Society, but he didn't even join until 1966 and wasn't given the title of the head PR guy until 1973. I may be telling you something you already know. But meme accounts rarely provide accurate, useful information. Alex isn't a scholar about his own cultural lineage or his ideological since successors. He doesn't know anything about this Robert Welch speech outside of the fact that he saw it posted on dumbass meme Twitter account, that Welsh speech is actually About an hour and 45 minutes long, not an hour long and it like I said, it's more or less just a verbal version of the blue book. Right. Welsh speaks for a very long time, and he's very boring, but he is introduced to stage by another one of the founding members of the John Birch Society. One of the other people there who was there at that first meeting, one of the original 12 trying to include Welch himself. No, Fred Koch was another of the founding members. But this is William J. Grady, who was the owner of Grady foundries incorporated one of the largest steel and iron producers in the country at the time. In addition to that, as is put in his obituary from the New York Times, quote from 1956 to 1961. He was a top official at JDI case company, a manufacturer of farm equipment. In both of these capacities great he had run ins with organized labor and he hated unions. What in 1960 auto workers, United Auto Workers declared a strike over breaches of collective bargaining and some messiness with paid vacation days at JDI case. Grady threatened to leave the city if workers didn't get back to work, but that move wasn't successful. And the strike ended up being resolved after six months. J I case has a long history of ending up in strikes. They had a then record setting 440 Day strike that ended in 1947. Before that, they had a 108 day strike in 1937. Reading over how that was covered in the New York Times is really interesting, and definitely gives you quite a sense that maybe the times wasn't so behind organized labor. Oh, yeah, quote, the first of the 1800 production workers thrown into idleness when the picketing forced the closing of the farm machinery manufacturing plants last October, we'll return to work tomorrow.

    | text      = JDI case had a long history with strikers, and it was well known that their leadership was very hostile toward unions and collective bargaining as a whole. And Grady foundries was no different. William Grady hated the idea of the needs and rights of workers getting in the way of his ability to make money. So it should be no surprise that in 1952, he became the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, a lobbying group that was very focused on fighting against the power of unions and workers rights. The National Association of Manufacturers was the recruiting pool that Robert Welch picked the first members of the John Birch Society from as well as himself who was on their board. At least half of the founding members were in high level positions with the National Association of Manufacturers. And there was a targeted effort on Welch's part to find new members for the JBS from within the National Association of Manufacturers. I go down this road a little bit, because it's important to understand that what motivated a lot of the anti communist fervor in the people who inspired much of Alex's worldview is that they hated paying workers fair wages, and they didn't want dumb things like safety precautions to cut into their profits. There's obviously a bit more to the birchers and what goes into their worldview. But this is not an insignificant piece of

He was also really fucked up dude. And 1939 article about him in the National Journal of literature and discussion said quote, Spangler has sailed modern medicine for interfering with natural selection and for accelerating racial decay, a strong race he defined as one with an inexhaustible birth rate compensating for severe selection process, which is provided by the resistances to living represented by misfortune, sickness and war, that the test of race for him was the speed of reproduction.

Haha, good. I can only catch no great conversation last night. But all I get is love now. And I noticed they had a bunch of publications will say Oh, look how crazy Jones is. No one loves him. Everybody hates me. That's like Tokyo rose. broadcasting the American sailors and marines. When we were right off the coast of Japan and already bonded in the Stone Age, weeks before we dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saying the Americans are defeated. America is on fire. No one hears about you. It's all over. You lost the war.

So what he's talking about here that kim.com tweeted about that Joe sent him was, there's a clip about a guy ranting about how COVID is a bio weapon. He's sitting in front of an EU flag, apparently at a meeting of the EU parliament. For God's sake. This guy is a COVID conspiracy hotshot. Pun intended. I named Dr. David Martin, and he's trying to bring back the bow tie look, which isn't going great. Not gonna happen. He spends the first six minutes of the clip talking about how we've known about coronaviruses for decades, which I found uninteresting, but he was presenting as if it's mind blowing information.

All right, they had a self help coach from Canada complaining about the media. And they had a doctor named Ryan Cole, who's about to lose his license. Coal is an interesting case, because he was very happy to profit from COVID. Early on as he ran a little lab in Garden City, Idaho, which he presented to Medicaid as quote using fully automated high volume systems that you can use to run test. I like that. The problem is that he wasn't doing that that's a trouble and they couldn't handle the load. They claimed they could cold claim that they could handle all this testing, and he accepted over $500,000 in government funds, which allegedly did not go to the ends of COVID test. Oh, that's a surprise. A former molecular diagnostic supervisor there told the Idaho Capitol son quote, It was volume over safety and accuracy. Cool diagnostics was a small lab at the beginning of 2020 and took on more than what Dr. Cole promised and said that it could do that summer. All in all, Cole has given over more than a million dollars in government funds, specifically for COVID related activity. He was more than happy to use the pandemic to get a ton of free money early on. But now the grift has kind of moved on and now we just got to be like man, yeah. A woman named Andrea when told the paper that the lab took shortcuts when doing COVID testing, quote, given Dr. Cole's public statements downplaying the severity of the virus, it makes sense that he was permissive of a lowered standard of testing. He either did not believe or refuse to acknowledge that bad results were of potentially high consequence to his patients and the public. She went on to say, quote, we were told to run specimens where we knew the integrity had been compromised. Certainly, the paper spoke to two other former employees and reported this quote, they noticed coal pouring liquid into dried out vials and running the tests with that reconstituted sample

He claims that he'd seen a big increase in cancer at his lab, which is strange because he's not supposed to be the kind of doctor that diagnosis patients. He's a pathologist with a lab. Yeah, he hasn't produced evidence of his claims about increased cancer, but he has apparently misdiagnosed at least two people as having cancer. And that's led to a complaint being raised to the Washington medical commission to quote investigate whether Cole has intentionally or subconsciously misread cancer tests while making false claims about COVID-19 vaccines of cancer. Also, one of the people he allegedly misdiagnosed is suing him after she needlessly got a hysterectomy because of his misdiagnosis. Wow, this guy sucks.
