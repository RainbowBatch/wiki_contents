    | text      = do. So the headline that Alex has there is naturally from Infowars. And it says quote, new Facebook policy allows violence against conservatives. This is based on an image from a Facebook community standards page that says you can cannot post threats quote, unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the dangerous individuals organizations policy, or is described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offences wherein criminal slash predator status has been established by media reports, market knowledge of news events, etc. Obviously, this policy was changed and doesn't exist like this anymore. But on the surface, it appears that Alex is exaggerating the story but isn't wrong that they do allow people to post support for violence against him. Sure. Under the surface, however, it's a different picture. The dangerous individuals and organizations list is separated into three tiers. And people are allowed to post about figures and each tier differently. Alex is certainly in tier three, which is the least severe of the groupings, where the first is mostly terrorist organizations. And the second is violent non state entities. The goal of the policy is to not take down threats to folks on this list is you don't want to shutter the speech of somebody who wanted to express outrage at ISIS for exam. Sure, sure. If you consult Metis Transparency Center, you'll find that these tiers are moderated differently. For instance, people in tiers one and two are subject to removal of content that praises them or offers support to them at all. Conversely, tier three folks are just not allowed to use meta products or coordinate on the platform. So Alex is getting a lot of mileage out of the like, yeah, you can threaten ISIS. Sure, sure. Sure, sure. And unfortunately, these like dangerous individuals is too big of an umbrella. Right? The difference between like a tier three and a tier one right are so so different.

We've never really covered him there because he's boring and he doesn't typically engage in fun space fantasies, which is really what you want there. Yeah. In 2017, Bennett appeared on Project Camelot, alongside Jim Fetzer to spread insane conspiracies about the Las Vegas shooting, but it doesn't end there. In 2022. Bennett was a featured speaker at Jim Fetzer is false flags and conspiracies Virtual Conference, where he spoke about bio and chemical weapons labs and Ukraine. He spoke on Sunday at 7pm, which is actually probably a way better watch than what they had on the agenda for Saturday at 7pm. That was when a dude named Fred lucre did a presentation on how there were no gas chambers in the Holocaust.
