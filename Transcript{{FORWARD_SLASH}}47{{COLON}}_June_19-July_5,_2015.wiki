    | timestamp = 00:14:20.000
    | text      = Yeah. So but here's it's actually really interesting and actually works against the argument shocker. So in 1956, Robert F. Williams took over leadership of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was close to disbanding due to the kk k. Williams filed for a charter with the NRA and formed the Black Guard, an armed group committed to the protection of blacks. Mabel Williams said her husband altered the occupations of the members when applying for the NRA charter. And she's quoted, I'm sure when we joined, and the years after that had they have known that we were a black group, they would have revoked our charter. She said of course. force, they basically just lied about it and started an NRA chapter. Yeah, of course. So that why wouldn't you do that? But that works pretty solidly against the argument that the everyone who's aware of things knows that that was started to help the black people. Well, yeah.

Yeah, so he's really pitching that hard. But on this Sunday show, he says something that I think is involved in his abortion narrative, but I'm not sure. But I could not do this show without playing this clip. Because it's so weird. Okay, listen to this argument. He tries to make me just recognize how fucking dumb he is.

Downtown Nashville board, but I'm going to send the crew out to videotape tomorrow. You can scan that billboard you understand everything now I'm not an enemy of Chick fil A, they're a conservative Christian organization. I think overall, it's a good company that hasn't bowed to censorship. And I'm not criticizing Chick fil A itself, but I'm using their ad campaign as a window into guilt politics. Now chicken is about four times cheaper on average than beef. And they set up their little Texas based company in shopping malls 30 something years ago, and it spread nationwide is very successful. So we're not talking about Chick fil A. But on their billboard, I meant to get a photo that was too dangerous driving see those cows up there, painting sign. And they've drawn a little children's style image of a chicken. And they say eat this knot this with an arrow pointed at him. And the cows look real, but they also look humanoid. So they feminized them and the chicken form it all, it's been downgraded to nothing like you do a baby in the womb, you call it just a blob. So the chicken looks like a two year old drill it just a yellow dot, a yellow blob with two eyes. And it's perfect. And it plays on your guilt of not wanting to hurt an animal when you eat it. So it's saying go eat our chicken. It's not as advanced a life form as a cow. And I guarantee you go talk to whoever came up with that ad campaign. They'll say Yeah, that's exactly what the campaign is cheap, the average person would not look at that I was on a carload of adults. One day we drove by it, and then today with my children, and no one knew what the propaganda was. And I said, Come on, you're smart. You know what it is? And see, that's the difference between me and other people. Oh, I just know. So many different so it's all clear.

And they wanted to get some 3d aspects in it, right? They made a bunch of pretty interesting ideas, but they were all kind of like, it's good. It's not good enough.

The north that was mainly industrial, had very high tariffs on the southern cotton, other things leaving the country, internal tariffs on them trying to sell their goods. Whenever we had a southern president, Andrew Jackson, the South tried to rebel against him and almost had a civil war over taxes. So so so even Jackson, northern agenda grew the South 2% of the South had slaves. Most of the whites that were poor, or as bad off as the black slaves. I mean, that's historical. They were called sharecroppers, they were slaves. For all intents and purposes, their ancestors got here to pay for the way over, they would sign up for seven to 10 years indentured servitude, I'm gonna skip this network breaks, we have more time to explain more, they would get over here. And so they were slaves to it doesn't take from the plight of the Africans who are definitely treated the worst on their way over here, and who were treated the worst when it came to their rights.

So the secession came before this Morelle tariff. Now, what's interesting is that the Confederacy wanted the British people to recognize the Confederacy as a sovereign nation. Yes. So what they did is they started to make the argument that because of the timing, the almost immediate passage of this mortal tariff, they what made the argument to the British that that's the reason that they succeeded, when that could not have possibly been the case. The secession led to the passage, right?

On March 12 1861, just 10 days after the moral tariff had become law, the London Times gave editorial voice to the tariffs lie, the newspaper pronounced that, quote, protection was quite as much a cause of the disruption of the union is slavery, and remarked upon how the moral tariff had, quote, much changed the tone of public feeling in favor of the secessionists.

They would just sell themselves. And it got to a point where the government Solon ended up having to be like, Nah, fuck this, you guys are all free. And that's what the North had to do. So, I mean, we did essentially save the United States by getting rid of slavery, right? So Alex is just an idiot, that he has more to say.

They weren't the children of the you know, the wagon train folks. We talked about skin about run a trotline the North was fighting Davy Crockett. So that's why they were in deep trouble.

But it's super normal. There's something that happens with every president. And I think one of the big reasons that Clinton didn't get it was because of the Larry Nichols types, and all the propaganda and the, quote, vast right wing conspiracy, that unfortunately is real, that Hillary complains about and is very much real. So speaking of rallies to cheer seems like speaking of Larry Nichols, he will be making an appearance on this episode here on the 23rd. This Tuesday show, but because Alex Jones is so bent out of shape about the TPP he plays a couple of really long videos, and one of them is Senator Jeff Sessions on the Senate floor. Oh, that's not good giving a speech about how the Trans Pacific Partnership takes away the sovereignty of the country and the Congress. Hmm. And this is the first instance of Alex being super complimentary about someone who would eventually be part of Trump's cabinet or part of Trump's campaign.

Everybody who is racist gets awards like Margaret Sanger and stuff like that. Okay. Whereas if you aren't racist, people call you racist because the globalists want to turn upside down world. Yes. So here is something from the NRAS website about Charlton Heston. There's a little bit of a biography. After the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy by a gunman Heston championed the Gun Control Act of 1968, a landmark federal law regulating firearms appearing on the ABCs The Joey Bishop show Heston said about the act, quote, this bill is no mystery. Let's be clear about it. Its purpose is simple and direct. It's not to deprive the sportsman of his hunting gun, the Marksman of his target gun, nor would it deny any responsible citizen, his citizen, his constitutional right to own a firearm, it is to prevent the murder of Americans. Heston oppose the Vietnam War and considered running for the US Senate as a Democrat. But by the 1980s, his political affiliation changed with his endorsement of a Republican Ronald Reagan for President. By 1997. He had joined the culture war, delivering a fiery speech at the free Congress foundation that argued that American society persecuted whites. A year later, he was elected the president of the NRA. Oh, oh, so it looks like maybe he lost his mind around 99.

He knows that this interview is coming. That's the prestige. That's the revelation. All of the other stuff is to prep the audience, scare them and get them into a state of mind where they're like, oh, yeah, he was talking about how it's going to collapse when he wasn't talking about TED ANDERSON. All of this stuff does predate him bringing this guy in. He's bringing this guy in to help us.

In this in this time when he is on Alex Lynx, Jesse's plight, the idea that he's being sued in this appeal of the case that he had one. He thinks that the reason they're doing that is that Hillary knows Oh, Jesse Ventura could beat her. Right. Jeb Bush is a way that's that's his angle. Jeb Bush is a weak candidate. A lot of other Republicans are weak, borne out by history. Rand Paul is great, but he probably couldn't win. Literally not. He's still he's still whole hog in the Rand Paul camp. Yeah, but he he's trying hard to get Jesse to run in this. So he's not like, like I said, this is 16 days after Trump announced his candidacy. Yeah, he's trying to get fucking Jesse Ventura to run.
