    | text      = like Don to Grand Prix. I have some bad news. Oh, no. Alex got he lost. Some of these cases, yes. With prejudice. News came out at the end of last week that Alex had lost to Sandy Hook trials in Texas court with the judge in the case, given the parents a default judgment. These two cases, initially were the ones brought by Leonard Posner and Veronica Dela Rosa, and the one that was brought by Scarlett Lewis. It took a little bit longer for the news to break on it. But there's also a third case that Alex lost that day, which was brought by Neil Heslin. I wanted to get deeply into the weeds on this development, but you know how I am with these technical issues, sometimes dropped the ball. So I just kind of embarrassed myself. Sometimes I get emails from people who are like, You don't you don't know this term. I believe in our first deposition episode. I called the guy a prosecutor. Yes, I embarrass myself. So you know what I think would be great. What What if, what if? What if we could get the Sandy Hook parents lead counsel Mark Bankston to come on our show and help explain it?

The the, the ethical rules regarding pretrial publicity, make me not be able to say a couple of things. For instance, I can't I can't talk to you about things like the credibility of certain witnesses or my belief on the guilt or innocence of certain people, all these kinds of things. Sure. There also becomes a sort of loophole when your opposing party completely abuses pretrial publicity and says the most insane things publicly that's sort of frees you up to get to talk. And so that's part of why I'm here today is that it's it's I'm a little bit freer than I would normally be because my opponent has made an absolute mockery.

So you know, we had a we had an, I think a credit to our judge in Texas who just recently retired, we had judge Scott Jenkins presiding over this, and he's an old scholarly judge who does things right by the book. And he was giving Infowars and Jones every chance they had to get in compliance to treat this correctly to I mean, a lot of other parties, they would have been done well before Jones, but you don't want to give Jones the ability to say I'm being railroad. Folks. There's a railroad job. They got me all set up. That's not what you want to do. And so we gave him every chance that he had, but after three years now we show up into our last year, and they basically just pretend like we have no idea what we're supposed to do.

And so, after a while, though, you kind of have to take a perspective on it, that you you embrace the absurdity of it all. And it's, I'll tell you this, it's, you know, it's particularly easy to find a good sense of humor about it all, when at the same time these things are happening, you are also just beating them up and down the courtroom. And in this case, when I'm sitting in that Jones deposition, and he is saying the most absurd stuff. Yeah, on some level, it's infuriating to watch him not take that process seriously. On the other hand, it's intensely rewarding when he says stuff like, oh, we ourselves, we never even investigated Sandy Hook. And thank you, Mr. Jones, thank you for telling me that. And that was was really good. But to circle back, because I haven't I haven't really answered your question is there done now. So this is over. For all intents and purposes, the judge has said, These people have disobeyed the rules with such intensity and with such consistency, that there's no way that my my judicial rulings are ever going to have any impact on. Yeah, so what she's done then is just declared judgment, which basically says, I'm going to instruct the jury that what he did was illegal, unlawful and cause damage to these plaintiffs. And their only job is figure out how much money that's worth.

And in Connecticut, one of the big things that they're talking about, it's an interesting idea is that part of why Jones did this so often and so much is because he ultimately found it profitable is that if you can look at the records and see that sales for brain force and Male Vitality, were higher on the days that Sandy Hook was being discussed, then you can show a motive that he had to do it. But personally, I also believe you can look at this and see that his motive is genuinely that he started to hate these parents, that these these parents became genuine financial threats to him, because if they got strikes with YouTube, every time he put up a picture of their kids saying that they were fake, then pretty soon, just as we saw, he loses his life is, you know, livelihood in terms of YouTube. And he started to hate these parents. And for us that that really was his motive is that is I think there's a part of Alex Jones that knew it was trouble to keep talking about Sandy Hook this way and he just couldn't To help himself because he hated these people so much.

Because, gosh, why would you want to get into any of this in a lot of ways, but it's really interesting that that my clients done in Texas, you know, where you have Linnaean, Veronique and Neil and Scarlett. Those are those are two families who were really heavily focused on, right like they put up the Posner's address to where they go pick up their mail. They said they were starting up anti First Amendment terrorist organization that was coming after Infowars. Viewers, they, they said the Neal Hudson was lying about holding his son with a bullet hole in the head, you know, like, it's this really personal crap. And so these clients are really stood up with their permission, because they were these personal targets, to be able to make this fight on behalf of everybody. And it's really been a brave struggle, particularly, you know, if Lynnie has been in this since the beginning. Yeah, within within a couple of weeks of this of the shooting, he wrote to Infowars and said, knock this off, why are you doing this? You know, this is Lenny is upfront about the fact that, you know, probably driving, once he dropped off that morning, he was driving away, he might have been listening to Infowars. He was actually kind of into that stuff, just because it was interesting to him. And to have these people stick because people don't want they sometimes don't realize is that we're talking about five years of straight harassment, followed by three years of the making a mockery of their lawsuits. Almost a decade, they've been having to deal with this crap.

Understand that he said things about Sandy Hook, but probably think it was it was a handful of occasions over a couple of years, that kind of thing. I was questioning, yeah, questioning. So that's the other big one I have to address as well. But you'll notice that if you watched his statement about in reaction to these default judgments, one of the things he said is you know I only mentioned this a couple of times, only a few times that I ever talked about Sandy Hook, and we don't because of your audience may not realize but but because of we bringing the suit and then there shortly thereafter, YouTube and Facebook deleting all their profiles Infowars has a lost irreparably a lot of its videos and content, it can't tell us everything. So we've kind of had to play Sherlock Holmes using the public record and try to figure out what videos were made and when. And right now our best estimate is that they made 100 episodes about Sandy Hook that employers have seen the thing we know that they made about 350 pages of Infowars articles about Sandy Hook. And so this is we're averaging about two shows a month over the entire span. Now there are some times when he hits it like to 2015 and 2017 years really hitting it hard. So those those more times, but generally five years of the straight harassment that people just don't know unless you're a real me. Everybody's seen the Media Matters clips right But but God when you really dig in there, I'm telling you, you have to sit there and you have to watch an hour and a half of an unscripted conversation between Jones and Wolfgang Halbig that will fry you.

You've seen who he is, you know who this man is? Right? I wouldn't want to even use I mean, look, I would never normally say in a deposition. Look, you got 4000 emails from him and reading them, you would agree with me, this man is a raving lunatic. But I'd normally wouldn't use that kind of language. But Wolfgang, how big? And? You know, look, I don't I don't think that I think that that statement is a matter of my opinion. It's not a statement of fact. But if Wolfgang Halbig is upset about that, please, please sue me, Wolfgang, because you're a raving lunatic, and you have caused enormous pain to these families. And Jones knew that like, because that's my other problem is people. The number one question I get on these cases is, does Jones believe the things that he said, and all I can do is point you to the public record. That's all I can do is point you to the public record into the deposition transcripts. And I think it becomes very clear that no, he never for a second thought these things were fake. You know, Jones talks a lot about your one of the observations you made that was very, very observant was the the idea of the media jumping on with both feet of this idea that he said it was a psychosis. And it's not it's not really what he said. He was making a metaphor, and it kind of was still pretty crazy. And it was a dumb thing to say. But there are people out there there are people out there who popular institutions, and and the powers that be and then just the shitty deal you get in life in America has made them distrust basically all official sources of authority. There's no question that that's a real thing that happens to people that it's not happened to Alex Jones, no, he's done that to other people. Exactly. profiting off of that, understands that phenomenon and wants to inflame and exploit it and be able to profit from it. And he can point to that as a justification. But he is not one of those people. He does not have that psychosis. No, but I think shows us that it all was malicious, every bit of it was malicious.

And now I'm in a position of who I really want to ensure his deposition and I'm not sure I'm going to get it because there's a very good chance he could be in federal custody by the time I want it.

Yep. We told the judge to look we're concerned not only about that deposition but that's why we want this deposition of Jones in October is because we're a little worried if you look onshore years arrest affidavit with all the pictures of Owen Shroyer being places he's not supposed to be.

That human right, the sad, right? And it's so silly. It's so in people. For so many years, people made viral video clips and stuff that were just making fun of these silly things Alex Jones would say, and then somewhere along the line, and it happened. Almost.

In other words, the discovery requests that were at issue in Texas that made him default, the case, none of this has anything to do with that. So just make that clear, right off the bat. But in Connecticut, they had asked him, it wasn't really Sandy Hook marketing materials. Basically what it was, is they wanted any, for any episode that Sandy Hook was discussed about. They wanted Infowars internal analytics, right? They want to know, what did they get off a Google ads, what did they get? How many hits? Did they get these sorts of things. And then Infowars also uses things like an internal Google Analytics program. It has some other metrics that it uses there. And they wanted to request all of that, which makes sense, pretty fair request, you got to know it, particularly the amount of views, right? Because if you want to establish how these people were damaged, you have to know how many people saw it. Right, like so. Ultimately, the total audience of Infowars is important. They asked for also, I think if they had if there were any emails that referred to special marketing initiatives for Sandy Hook, and by that, I mean, guys, we're gonna make a special promotional page or we're going to promote a can you make sure on this video, can you promote some Sandy Hook videos because they've been really popular?

And then for some reason, like about two years after she lost the election, she decided to go recruit some attorneys in the Sandy Hook families to pursue a vendetta against Alex Jones and that apparently I'm under Clinton payroll and all this type of

    | text      = Well, you know, in Jones's own feverish sort of construction of all of this, Hillary Clinton is a big reason why he said some of the things he said about Sandy Hook, particularly after 2016, is because when she used him as a prop, to attack Trump, and to say, Trump's associated with this guy, and this guy's a mess, right? And this guy said, Sandy Hook didn't happen. And everything she said about him was 100%. True. But she was using him very clearly as a campaign prompt to try to score some points. And I got no problem with that, whatever. But but once he did that, that enraged Jones, that was it, because Jones at that point was on this trajectory to become very mainstream. He had he had got Trump on his show, he was being credited at that time with Trump's victory. And so that's why just after the election, in November, right after the election, he did a broadcast called Alex Jones final statement about Sandy Hook. And basically, he couldn't stop talking about it, because Hillary talked about him. So he had to respond back. So his genius idea was to get on there and go, Well, look, here's all the reasons I thought it was fake. And, honestly, if it hadn't been for that, like some of this case would have never happened, right? If the parents they were of the position that if Jones had stopped after 2016, they probably wouldn't have pursued this. Right. But it was this vendetta that kept up is that not only did he do it, then, but then just a couple of months later, in the new year, in 2017, he did a video called Sandy Hook vampires exposed. Yeah, yeah, that's the one that accuses my clients of faking them. bluescreen ever. So here we are in 2017. And he just can't stop. Because He also posted these parents.

Oh, yeah. He started it. Okay, so I just I want that to be fair for the State Bar. He started it and in all seriousness, it has been a situation where his his public statements have been absurd. I've for somebody look, I have the opportunity to be on national television whenever I want. If somebody wants talk to Sandy Hook lawyer, it's gonna happen and I haven't done that. I've done it fairly infrequently. You know, I've when we first started I went on the Today Show the very first time I've done a PBS Frontline appearance about this issue to talk about it.

So I'm not worried about influencing the jury for anything that I did want to come talk about it with you all because I feel like this suit has been really interesting to the wider culture and not enough really hard analysis has been done on it not enough real attention has been paid to it.

I'll be in charge of defamation. No, I'm not in that case. Yeah.
