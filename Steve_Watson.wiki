'''Steve Watson''' is a long-time contributing writer for [[InfoWars]], and is the brother of [[Paul Joseph Watson]].

Although Paul is the more popular brother, by a mile, Steve was actually the first of the Watson's to give being on-air talent a chance. In early 2009, [[Alex Jones]] had Steve Watson on to talk about the news, and presumably his performance was not what Alex was looking for, since he has not become a major on-air talent, while his brother certainly has.

It has been speculated (as a joke) that Steve does not actually exist and is a persona created early on by Paul, who was dissatisfied with the rate Alex paid him and wanted to double his salary. While almost certainly not true, this would make Steve slightly more interesting than he is currently.
