'''Larry Sinclair''' is a fraudster<ref>https://www.politico.com/story/2008/06/obama-accuser-has-long-rap-sheet-011164</ref> who falsely claims to have had oral sex and done cocaine with [[Barack Obama|Obama]] in 1999.

He first surfaced during the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, when he was largely ignored due to his severe credibility problems, complete lack of corroborating evidence, and a failed polygraph test (although polygraph tests are unreliable). After [[Tucker Carlson]] got relegated to Twitter, he was interviewed by Tucker in 2023 for some bizarre reason<ref>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12489287/larry-sinclair-barack-obama-cocaine-sex-tucker-carlson.html</ref>, which was covered in [[852: Tucker, The Man And His Twitter- Episode 5|Episode 852]].
