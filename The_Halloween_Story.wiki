*Version #4 (11-12)
**Alex doesn't celebrate Halloween (it's occultic), it was only Buckley's birthday

***Alex asked them "So what if I'm a Nazi?"
***Alex said to them "You know I'm not a Nazi!.... You just wanna have me kiss your butt...How dare you imply I'm a Nazi...I suggest you walk away fast!"
