Today, Dan and Jordan check in on what Alex Jones is up to in the present day and find both very expected and very surprising things. On the very expected side, Alex gets super bigoted, then spends a disproportionate amount of his show talking about how he should be more cocky about how good his body is. On the more surprising end, Alex Jones announces that he just sold out his audience to what is embarrassingly probably the highest bidder.
