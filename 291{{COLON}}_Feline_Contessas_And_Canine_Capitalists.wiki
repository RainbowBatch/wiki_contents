Today, Dan and Jordan take a Wacky Wednesday break from talking about Alex Jones to take a little look into some chaos in Project Camelot land. Sweary Kerry has been pretty mad lately about a British guy who is making a documentary about how her friend Mark Richards is not a space captain (which he is not), but actually a murderer (which he is). As professional Mark Richards analysts, the gents decide that they need to know a little more about this situation, so they dig in and see what's up.
