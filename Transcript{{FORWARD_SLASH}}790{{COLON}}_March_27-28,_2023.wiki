I don't know for sure because Alex isn't specific, but I think he may be referring to the George HW Bush stuff. DeSantis is tweet from the day He died. Say that bush died. He said, quote, President Bush amassed prodigious accomplishments. And he did it all with uncommon Grace class and honor, appreciation of his achievements will only continue to grow as the years go by President Bush was an American hero, a faithful servant and the greatest Yalie of them all.

His comments about George HW Bush then started complaining about George W. Bush being a Rockefeller stooge, also super wild to hear that W was a Democrat, could have sworn he was definitely a Republican. But here's the thing, words mean nothing. And you have to understand them in their context. When people like Alex are talking. When these folks say that DeSantis was in Scotland bones, the truth or falsity of that statement doesn't matter. They're saying he's shitty because he's close to the establishment. When Alex says that W was a Democrat, the truth or falsity of that doesn't matter.

What's your plan to take the country back? That's your next segment, but let me tell you what else is coming up. Minnesota Minnesota lawmakers advanced transgender reps legislation that could strip custody from parents Sudan support child being sterilized. Arizona Family Dollar employee charged with murder after allegedly gunning down Shurl shoplifter the punching in the face. What? Minnesota advanced trans refugee bill. Opponents say what strip testing is focused on something shifting parents you must have set the state sterilize your child. GOP bill would protect parents who refuse to transition their child's gender FoxNews. And a whole lot more Tennessee legislature passes ban on gender transition health care for minors. Kentucky Governor says he's gonna veto a bill protecting minor children from being sterilized by the state. I know science transgender bathroom, man, school faces 5000 Fine per infraction. I've got public schools around the country where they're forcing elementary students, middle students and high school students into transgender bathrooms everyone is in the same bathroom at the same time for telling children it's a hate crime if they don't strip down in front of the opposite sex. What a sick cult of evil garbage.

    | text      = So it should be pointed out that this is what Alex is prepared to cover. And he has no idea that a mass shooting has even happened. He stated plan on this episode was to lie about misrepresented headlines in order to incite hatred towards trans people, because that's what his show and much of the right wing media is currently, a lot of it is indistinguishable from media designed to promote hate, right? Because maybe it's not that different. No. This is another case where you have to translate what Alex is saying. He keeps saying that these people are being sterilized, which is not the case. There may be some decreased virility that accompanies hormone therapy. But there are studies that have shown that a lot of that reverses if a person ceases taking the hormone. This isn't about sterilization. But again, the truth or falsity of what Alex is saying is not really important to what he actually means. He's just saying that he hates trans people, him calling gender affirming care, sterilization is little more than him virtue signaling to his transphobia. And more general bigotry. So the audience knows that he's on their side, yes.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:38:54.000
    | text      = So Alex read that headline, which is about Idaho, banning trans people from going to bathrooms that correspond with their gender. Incidentally, this bill was written by the Idaho Family Policy Center, a right wing Christian group who is seeking to turn the US into a theocracy. They want to impose biblical standards into government. And that's really cool. According to their president Blair kanzashi, who said, quote, God's law grants more freedom and enables more human flourishing than any other moral philosophy known to man. He left off the part where that freedom and human flourishing doesn't count if you're flourishing in a way that he thinks is sinful, so fuck off, right? Oh, whatever. Right? So back to the point though, Alex reads that headline and then gets lost in the weeds rambling about elementary schools where people have to strip down with folks of all genders in the same bathroom or else it's a hate crime. You may notice something really glaring there. The headline and the actual article about the anti trans legislation is really easy to find and be specific about where his his stories about these horrors of liberalism run amok are vague, unsourced and seemed like maybe he's making them up, and that's because he's making that shit up. But the anti trans legislation is very real. yield. Yeah. So that's that's that dynamic there. But I think his audience is probably more interested in the stories that are vivid and not true. Yes. Making up.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:53:29.000
    | text      = That's categorically false, no matter how you splice or try to massage the numbers. What has happened here is that Alex is seeing a meme that was floating around in right wing social media circles that sought to paint the picture that most shooters are LGBTQ but right out of the gate. They include the club Q shooter, as someone who's non binary when all evidence points to the conclusion that that was him trolling an attempt to avoid a hate crime charges perhaps. In reality, Alex went on air and reported that the shooter in Uvalde was a trans person based on troll posts from places like 4chan. And to my knowledge, he's never taken the time to apologize or correct that serious mis reporting. And actually, he re reports that later in this episode, right? So that's fun. Alex is seeking to paint the picture that the media covers up these school shooters, that these school shooters are trans because if you try to look into it, you'll find that they aren't and he needs an explanation for that lack of evidence for his claim. His position would be totally vindicated if it weren't for an elaborate media cover up that's going on. This naturally raises the question of why the media isn't covering up anything about this current shooter and their reported potential gender identity. It seems like maybe the media doesn't actually cover that stuff up, but Alex needs the audience to think that they do so it's easier for his hate mongering and exaggeration to fly and be accepted. The truth or falsity of this statement that LGBTQ people are responsible for the majority of mass shootings or school shootings is a meaningless question to people like Alex. It doesn't need to be true, because the truth or falsity is not What they're conveying to the audience, Alex is trying to make sure the audience sees LGBTQ folk and trans people in particular as the enemy and a very dangerous enemy, a very dangerous enemy that the media is covering for. It's a waste of time to argue the underlying points that someone like Alex or Matt Walsh, or Ben Shapiro had been making in the aftermath of the shooting, because the underlying points are meaningless to them to begin with. They're happy to use this tragedy to attack trans people but lambaste people for discussing gun control after any other shooting, because they detest the tasteless politicization of tragedy. They don't detest the politicization. They just know when politicization can be useful to them, and they're savvy enough to pretend to be above it, when they know they can't use that tragedy. As much as they do believe that pretending that their underlying points mean anything is a trap, it's still incredibly important to recognize what is going on and to push back on it as strongly as possible. The anti trans rhetoric is escalating in ways and at speeds that should be terrifying to anyone who's paying attention and that cannot be ignored. It's a strange balancing act because this shooting is being used as an excuse for these right wing commentators to ramp up their bigotry, but they don't actually care about the shooting. As we saw earlier in this episode, Alex was doing sensational bullshit anti trans story is already and Matt Walsh and Michael Knowles have been calling for an elimination of trans identity for weeks, if not months prior to this shooting. Yeah, there's doing it. They're just using this as a prop. Yeah, they hate trans people. That's the only point worth paying attention to not whether, whatever window dressing, they're throwing on their hate today, they don't care about that window dressing and will abandon it for something new tomorrow, if it better serves their purposes. Yeah. So this kind of stuff like this 80% of shooters or trans people. Yeah, it's not worth arguing with. It's not true. But it also doesn't matter to Alex. Yep. It's not what he's getting across to the audience. Yeah. And that can be challenging that can be that can be a difficult place to be, and especially in these very aggressive spaces, like the social media, you know, people are firing this stuff up off, and a lot of times are doing it in such a way as to incite backlash upon them, because it games the system and gets them far more engagement with their posts. Yeah, so like, I don't know, I don't have a prescription for it, but it sucks. Yeah,

You can tell that Alex likes Blair white, because he thinks she's feminine enough for him to see her as a woman. And her transness doesn't encroach on any of the larger hollow culture war topics he pretends to care so much about, like women's sports. In fact, a majority of Blair's public existence is based on trying to place limits on other people's transness and make videos about people who she thinks are going too far or whatever. Yeah, her brain does. Essentially, I'm one of the good ones and look at all these other people who are bad. Yeah, I had actually planned to do an episode about Blair a while back because I think that she exists in a really interesting space. And Alex has been on her podcast twice. So there was some content there. But I ultimately decided not to because looking into her made me really sad. And I didn't know what to do with those feelings. Yeah, case in point three years ago, she put out a video where she was sitting next to her couch on the floor, her makeup was smudged from crying where she's discussing something that she'd never talked about before.

I'm certain that that that's true. Yeah. But on the other hand, it's incredibly difficult to hold on to too much care about her when you consider the reality of what she's saying. She didn't lie about her transition being easy because it's somehow emotionally more easy for her to do that. She did it because if she had made it to the challenges she's faced, it would severely undercut her entire brand. The people she hates on and who are her political targets are the people We're working to create a better world where people like young Blair wouldn't have to have had such a hard time being herself. Acknowledging that you really could have used more care and more support and your younger days means the trans activists have a point and that that's not a point that you can really rebut unless you pretend that they don't have a point, which you can achieve by pretending that your lived experience doesn't match up at all with what those activist types are saying. It's profitable for Blair to lie about her transition. That's why she did it. Later in the video, she talks about how her dad's side of the family disowned her because she's trans and that really sucks. Family alienation is a real nightmare, and no one deserves to experience that just for being themselves. Given that she's experienced all this in her life. I don't believe for a second that she doesn't realize that Alex Jones's career in rhetoric is designed around creating more people like her dad's family. I don't believe for a second that she doesn't realize that the brand she's created is trying to position herself as the one good trans people, a person, which facilitates the stigmatization of all trans people who aren't her. On some level, she understands this, this next clip from that video really spoke to me about that awareness.

But maybe if they saw that she was also demonizing trans people, they would accept her then she's essentially disgusting chasing the acceptance and approval of people who hate a fundamental aspect of who she is, which she's never going to achieve with her family. But she can achieve with Alex and all these other right wing figures. There's a profit motive there and they need somebody they can use as a prop to deflect criticism about their transphobia. So she'll be adored in that circle, which she is, but it comes with a cost. And apparently even though it hurts quite a bit, Blair thinks that arrangement is worth it. So no, I don't particularly care if Alex likes Blair white because he doesn't actually or at least he wouldn't if she was honest about her experience, because then she'd say that her dad's family disowned her for being trans and Alex would have to admit that he thinks that they did the right thing. Anyway, sorry about that. A little side trip back to Alex's actual clip. There have been female mass shooters before. It's certainly more rare than male ones but they do exist. Nasim Aghdam carried out the shooting the YouTube campus back in 2018. Nash Fein Malik was one of the San Bernardino shooters in 2015. Jennifer San Marcos killed six people at a California post office. It's rare but it's not unheard of. So go fuck yourself, Alex.

And they make the point that, you know, the group that gets divorces, the most often in married couples, statistically, is people doing hormone therapy to try to get pregnant, a 45 year old woman trying to get pregnant and to put them on a bunch of hormones to get them jacked up to do it.

The Colorado Springs shooter was the club cue shooter and the ivaldi shooter wasn't even in the meme, but Alex vaguely remembers his own shitty reporting. So he throws them in. Yeah, why not? This isn't a sincere point that's being made, and honestly, it comes off more like parody. These are the examples that these folks can find. Whereas the 1000s of other mass shootings apparently didn't happen or something. Further, whenever there are these shootings, Alex insists on not ascribing group blame, he screams about how all white people are to blame when shooting for shooting because the shooter was a white supremacist or how all gun owners are being blamed because the person had a ton of guns with them. It's easy to see how that is kind of a meaningless principle for him and he's more than willing to throw it to the side when there's the opportunity to imply group blame on groups. He doesn't like when that pops up that opportunity. He takes it. He doesn't want to feel like groups. He's a part of our being discussed in relation to mass shootings, but it's a group he spends most of his time demonizing group blame is pretty cool. Yeah. Also, I don't know about the pregnancy hormone divorce thing. I have no idea how I would go about checking up on it since apparently, it's something some doctor personally told Alex. But it's weird that the example Alex comes up with isn't a guy on steroids. Hmm. Or maybe that hits too close to home. I don't want to bring any attention to that. No, no.

That's who Alex is. He's not misgendering the shooter because they're a shooter that doesn't factor into the assessment of whether or not their gender identity was valid. Alex believes this about all trans people. But because this particular person did a horrible thing, it's easier for him to be blunt about his beliefs when discussing them. And that is who he is.

Those are good when he needs to distract from the details about the shooter because they're super right wing white guys who have identical politics to Alex.

One of the first targets of the Nazis was the Institute for Sexual science and its head Magnus Hirschfeld Hirschfeld was a pioneer in research around issues related to sex and gender, which were seen as societal perversions and attacked by the Nazis on the rise to power. On May 6 1933, the Institute was ransacked by Nazi youth along with sa officers, much of the materials that were looted from that were burned and a giant book burning shortly after. If Alex believes the trans identity being accepted as a sign of society and collapse, then he has to think that the Nazis were trying to stop that collapse. Yeah. At the very least Alex and the Nazis are in pretty solid agreement in their views here.

    | text      = And maybe like some of their work. Yeah. Alex is also just making shit about these were head studies. So he's talking about John B. Calhoun's experiments, which gave rise to the concept of behavioral sync. This isn't about the decadence or generational decay. The thing that was discovered by these experiments was that if rats are in an enclosed space, and allowed to reproduce freely, their behavioral patterns will change in strange ways. Calhoun found that in this artificial setting, the rats tended to impose their own areas of high population density, they could spread out to tons of other areas, but they ended up congregating heavily in the pen. That was the where the feeding happened. Like they meant they had this feeding part of Patrick's Day. Yeah, he found quote, in the case of eating this transformation did not keep the animals from securing adequate nutrition, but the same pathological togetherness that tended to disrupt the ordered sequences of activity involved in other vital modes of behavior, such as courting of sex partners, the building of nests, and the nursing and care of the young. In the experiments in which the behavioral sync developed, infant mortality ran as high as 96% Among the most disordered groups in the population. A large part of this has to do with the effect of overcrowding on disruption of rat behavior, which was somewhat mitigated in other parts of the pens where the population density didn't get as high. In these pens, infant mortality was much lower in generally they'd have less rats in there, they wouldn't end up congregating into this one pen. Sure. And they would have a male rat who had established dominance over a harem of female rats, who would then have the time and space to protect their young during weaning. Sure, there were dominant males and then underneath them in the societal weirdness, there were some males that were unable to distinguish sexual partners. They will try to mate with male rats, juveniles and females that were not in estrus. I'm not sure if this is the dynamic that Alex is depicting. I'm sure Alex isn't depicting it accurately. But that's kind of what he's harkening to. Yeah, they also found that some non dominant rats began to become basically sleepwalkers only going to eat when everyone else was asleep. They were completely passive, never engaging in fights for dominance, nor even trying to fuck female rats. Just kind of like weird night monks right. There were also a small group of hypersexual rats that Calhoun called the provers who were totally out of pocket. They were just trying to fuck anything and they were engaged, they'd engage in cannibalism. They were also total creeps hiding out on purchase trying to stare at female rats. It's it's interesting, because you can sort of see how you would personify the war fighters. Yeah,

The powder was easier to eat quickly. So the act of eating didn't become a strange social thing. And overcrowding in that collective eating pan didn't end up happening. So they kind of theorized that some of it had to do with like it taking longer to eat from these hoppers. And so then it became a normalized thing that rats only ate when other rats were around. Sure. And then it just became super overcrowded. And it led to a breakdown of all these behavioral, just sort of normal patterns, right?

This shooting wasn't necessarily political violence is horrible, and it's a tragedy but do we know whose political violence seems like a bit of a leap particularly for when Alex was on air talking about this? All they were doing was trying to disenfranchise trans people will have having their Second Amendment rights. Yeah, that's what that was about. Yeah. That's something that Alec probably shouldn't be in favor. Oh, yeah. You think? Yeah, yeah, you would think, wouldn't you?

But we're told we can see on posts she made that it was she was mad at trans phobics. The way you look back at those as you shoot some eight, nine year old children to death is the rifle. So this is a definitely a new thing. I have women who think there are men out doing what the media advertises mass shootings, and we know the copycat effect, that when somebody jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge, they go to post cops there for about a week as a bunch others will start doing it. And it causes like a stampede of lemmings. So now it's kind of out there in the mind of the folks on all these psychotropic drugs and hormones that, well, the way you protest is you just go to a Christian school, you know, in a state that's passing a law that you can't mutilate children surgically. And yeah, you mean like kids with high powered rifle rounds?

And that's just like Alex Jones saying attack schools. Well, when did I ever Chessy they know the general public doesn't know about Adam Lanza that did the shooting at Sandy Hook.

Wade, and she joked, well, I thought of murder. For some reason, Newsweek ran an article about how idiots on Twitter were saying that if Alex had to pay a billion dollars for his Sandy Hook coverage, then Fonda should have to pay 5 billion for making that joke. It's really strange that this past an editor's desk because it's honestly incoherent. Some people on Twitter were saying that Fonda's comments were quote, directly linked to the deadly mass shooting at an elementary school in Nashville, which I'm not sure makes sense. Nor does it justify an article is the argument now that the shooter in Nashville was motivated by the restriction of access to reproductive care? I'm confused about how this shooting seems to be about a million different things depending on which culture war particular Twitter user is concerned about. Like it's very weird. I don't I can't keep track of all this. Yeah. fonden never said anything about Christians. I was just making that up. And the article even says, quote, Jones did not incite violence with his comments. The point is that Alex is absolutely covering this just because it's about him.
