Today, Dan and Jordan embark on an adventure that is probably a very dumb idea: covering the entirety of Alex Jones' very stupid "documentary" [[Endgame]]. Dan found approximately 130 specific instances of Alex either lying or "playing with the truth," so this could take a while. In this first episode, the gents learn that Alex doesn't know what "quote" means, but he does love Nazi propaganda films.
