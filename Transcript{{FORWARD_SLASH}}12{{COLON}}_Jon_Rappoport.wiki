And he does say that the this idea that chemical imbalance, being responsible wholly for mental illness is an urban legend, never theory seriously propounded by well informed psychiatrists. But he goes on to explain. He's quoting the National Institute of Mental mental health director Thomas INCEL. Here, as Intel describes, the new model conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are attributable to rare but highly potent genetic variations that lead to dysfunction in multiple complex complex brain circuits. However, the particular symptomatic manifestations in a given individual, the disease phenotype is partly dependent on the person's experiences and environment, we may hypothesize, and this is my view, not necessarily doctor in cells, that given developmentally based biases in various neuro circuits, the young boy or girl may be predisposed to the use of certain dysfunctional cognitive strategies, for example, viewing everyone in the environment as uniformly threatening or rejecting.

There are plenty of times where, I mean, if you go through the history of bipolar disorder, it's really hard to diagnose, because it may be that your symptoms are exactly the same as this disease or exactly the same as that disease.

Okay, a lot of stress. Instead of moral support and insight. Her doctor gave her house doll. That's an anti psychotic that is a neuroleptic, a major tranquilizer those are all names for that class of drugs. Over the next four years leisure is. Six different physicians watched her deteriorate neurologically without warning her or family about tardive dyskinesia motor brain damage, and without making the diagnosis. Even when she was overtly twitching in her arms and legs. Instead, they switched her from one neuroleptic to another, including the vein Estelle, Xen and Thorazine. Eventually a rehabilitation therapist became concerned enough to send her to a general physician, who made the diagnosis of medical drug damaged by then she was permanently physically disabled, with a loss of 30% of her IQ. And then Bragin says my medical evaluation described her condition, grossly disfigured, and severely disabled human being who can no longer control her body. She suffers from extreme writhing movements and spasms involving the face, neck, head, shoulders, limbs, extremities, torso and back nearly the entire body. She has had difficulty standing sitting or lying down and the difficulties worsen as she attempts to carry out voluntary actions. At one point she could not prevent her head from banging against nearby furniture. She could hold up to a couple only with great difficulty, etc, etc. Even her respiratory movements are seriously afflicted, so that her speech comes out in grunts and gasps. A miss spasms. Roberta may improve somewhat after several months off the neuroleptic drugs, but she will never again have anything remotely resembling a normal life.
