Well, it's it's obviously serious, and it's killing people. And it's a deadly strain of flu. But the reason we see the flu is always coming out of Asia, is because they'll have 10s of 1000s of pigs in pens on these giant hog farms right next to 1000s and 1000s of geese and chickens. And they've done the studies they've known for 50 years. It's because of the manure on the different species combined together and becomes like giant petri dishes, where different types of flu viruses mutate and merge together. And that's where it's all coming from.

Good to find good chance to talk to you had a couple of things that I wanted to let you know, one was, you've gone over this thing a bunch of times on the Silverstein video on that. But last Thursday, I decided to send them a link in email to about 25 different friends on the page that you had set up on prison planet.com with all the different videos and all different information, and a sample 25 emails about 11 o'clock Thursday night. And then Friday, I decided to check it because I put in the email I wanted comments back from a my friends on what they thought about this. And Friday night, I go to go into my email, check it and I type in my password. And of course, it says invalid password or username. I tried this three times got the same message. And I decided to click on the Help button and I did that and we get a page it comes up says this Yahoo account has been deactivated. I found it to be quite interesting. And I went to go to my Yahoo Messenger to see if I could get on that and talk to some people. And I plugged in my username and password. And I get a little message comes up says system. Your account has been locked for security reasons. So that's never happened before when I've emailed anything out. And I've got this happening now.

Who knows what even fucking Sure, sure. So in 2001, a New York Observer reporter named Ron Rosenbaum published an article about how he and a team had spied on what they decided must have been a skull and bones initiation ceremony from the roof of a neighboring building from which they could spy into the courtyard. And this is kind of raises an important question. Like if it's this easy to spy on the skull and bones rituals, why hasn't anyone done it previously, it's not like the neighboring building was just built. If the bones men were really as concerned about ultimate privacy as they appear to be you think that they would have the foresight to know that their courtyard was plainly visible from an easy to access rooftop. It's almost like they don't actually need total privacy. But the allure of mystery is the only thing that gives them any kind of meaning in society. So you play into it. Yeah, I watched this video, and it's dumb. It's really hard to make out a lot of what's going on because it's at night, and it was shot on the quality of cameras that were around in 2001. So you kind of have to fill in a lot of the gaps yourself, which is exactly what Alex is doing. Yeah. From what I can tell, they definitely make some dude kiss a skull, and there's a lot of yelling.

And it seems unlikely that a group that's so invested in tradition and their own history would just up and change the initiation ceremony into this screaming nonsense. Having watched the video and poked around a little bit for contextual information, I'm inclined to believe the perspective that the former bones man, Steve McDonald, told the Yale daily news when he speculated that the whole thing might have been staged or that there's like a prank going on. Another compelling point he makes is that with few exceptions, these kinds of rights are carried out inside the headquarters. Of course, not in the courtyard course. Yeah, I think this is all really silly. And ultimately, it's a situation where the only people profiting from these kinds of stories are the conspiracy theorists and the elites that conspiracy theorists get to sensationalized shape in order to craft more interesting narratives to capture their audience and bullshit worldviews. The elites, particularly the Ivy League, folk who are part of these secret societies in college, they get to enjoy the mystique that this attention gives them and how the absurdity of it all places them into somewhat elevated position above the masses. Oh, you've gone through these secret rituals and rites of secrets and maybe even supernatural powers that you don't have access to. Because you're not one of the elites. Yeah, it's all just a dumb game. Might as well be like reality TV, quite frankly.

The idea is that when he is a presidential directive, saying that all investigations needed to leave the bin Laden alone, the implication being that the Bush's family ties to the bin Laden's made them negligent, or that Bush was trying to make sure that no one uncovered the 911 plot before it could be carried out. Right. Alex ever the storyteller would exaggerate this, in his book dissented to tyranny, saying that it told quote, FBI agents as well as defense intelligence officers that if they tried to stop al Qaeda, they would be arrested under national security implications. Basically, this is a document that's used to explain why the plot wasn't uncovered within the conspiracy narrative worldview, right, but it's also bullshit. The document itself is from 1996. So Bush has nothing to do with it. And there's no reason to even assume that Clinton did either. It's a narrow FBI document reflecting a closing of an investigation into one Osama's family members, Abdullah bin Laden, who was under scrutiny because of his association with the world assembly of Muslim youth, the document itself doesn't even reflect in order to not investigate Abdullah, it just says, Is that the case that was involved? It opened in February 1996. And it closed that September. So they were saying no, Whammies? Right. No weenies. No, me. The implication that this relates to in order to not investigate bin Laden family members or folks from Saudi Arabia comes from Greg Palace coverage of the document, where he claimed that unknown, unnamed sources told him that some unspecified cases were quote, shut down for political reasons, but nothing further is established. And it's just, you know, you take that grain of something that is on sourced specifically from Greg Palast. And Alex will exaggerate from there into being like, all terrorism.

The formerly strapping six to New Yorker who started out a healthy 185 pounds head packed on 25 pounds, but his supersize shape was the least of his problems and a few days of beginning the drive thru diet Spurlock 33 was vomiting out the window his car. This was all documented for a documentary and doctors who examined him were shocked at how rapidly Spurlock's entire body deteriorated.

You punch somebody 45 times they will die guaranteed if you're really punching somebody. Just again, it's all false reality people don't know. Most people don't don't think about how food gets to the grocery store. How they hear radio shows, I get questions all the time by people. Well, how do I up and listen to you and awesome radio and I heard you and another city 1000 miles away, do you how do you go? Do you live there too? And these are people with businesses and families and I go satellites, satellites. That people don't think how things work. They don't know how many continents they are there are they don't know where Iraq is. They don't know what the bill of rights that they don't know anything, but just mindless idiots. And I'm starting to realize this more and more. And it just scares me to death.
