Today, Dan listens to the voice of the people and brings Jordan up to speed on what is going on in modern day Alex Jones. Unfortunately, the day that they end up covering involves Alex reporting on the murder of over 50 Palestinians by Israeli soldiers by mostly just talking about Muslims being bad. That isn't the most fun, but to make things even less fun, Milo Yiannopoulos shows up to "joke around" with Alex to try to drum up some cheap free press about their dumb jokes.
