Today, Dan tells Jordan about one of the weirdest days ever on The Alex Jones Show. Alex begins the show really depressed about Satanists and finishes the show by barging out of the studio for one of the most childish reasons imaginable. The key is in what happens in between, like Alex thinking the show Gunsmoke is realistic.
