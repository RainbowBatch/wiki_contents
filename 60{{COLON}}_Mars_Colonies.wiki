Dan is sick of all the nonsense about a guest on The Alex Jones Show talking about secret Mars Colonies, so he calls an audible and changes the format of the show. The reason that Alex and his guests get to feign credibility is because they speak about things like Mars Colonies very non-specifically. But what happens when you take one of their non-specific claims and pay close attention to it? In this case, you end up learning a whole lot about a super soldier/Mars warrior.
