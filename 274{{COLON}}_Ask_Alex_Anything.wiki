{{Stub}}

Today, Jordan was busy, so Dan called in Robert Evans (Behind The Bastards) to join him for a bonus episode. After finishing recording his own show on Tuesday, Alex Jones and PJW did an "Ask Me Anything" live on the air, and things did not go quite how any of them may have planned.

==Tidbits==

*Alex is drunk at 4pm on The War Room
*Alex just had arm surgery, so he may be mixing alcohol and pills
*Owen and Paul should not have let Alex be on air
*Paul is condescending to Alex
*Alex is having a breakdown
*Fuck Paul and Owen
