    | timestamp = 00:05:29.259
    | text      = Like, it doesn't seem sincere. It just seems like he's a Trump apologist. Right. I think it's more interesting, I think, to go back to 2008 just because he is still relatively under the radar back then.

    | text      = At one point, never mind. That's a spoiler for another episode. He's not anti-Obama at this point. No. He's not at all. In fact, he has an interview with someone that we'll talk about on a future episode.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Unknown Speaker
    | timestamp = 00:07:27.259
    | text      = He's too anti-Hillary to... And he's saying stuff like Obama is going to get killed because he's an outsider. That sort of stuff. That's where his mind is at at this point.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Unknown Speaker
    | timestamp = 00:07:37.259
    | text      = Okay. But still no talk about the primaries, no real talk about the election at all. So strange because if you... Like this election that we just had lasted eight years.

    | timestamp = 00:07:48.259
    | text      = It twisted my mind into thinking, of course they'll be talking about this in March. Yeah, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it makes you think that that's a reasonable thing for an election to take three years.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Unknown Speaker
    | timestamp = 00:07:57.259
    | text      = No. Turns out it was not a hot topic back then. But what was? Let's start on March 30th and see what Alex is obsessed about. Okay. Spoiler alert. He's freaked out about CERN.
