The Proud Boys is a far-right, male-only organization known for its extremist views and involvement in violent street crime. The group was founded in 2016 by Canadian far-right activist [[Gavin McInnes]], and has since grown to have chapters across the United States and other countries. The Proud Boys have been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center due to their anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and misogynistic views<ref>https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys</ref>.

Several people discussed by Knowledge Fight have been associated with the Proud Boys, including [[Enrique Tarrio]], [[Kyle Chapman]] (known as "Based Stickman" for his violent stick-based attacks on left-wing protesters), [[Ethan Nordean]] ("Rufio Panman", known for assaulting people with a pan), [[Joe Biggs]] (a former [[InfoWars]] employee), and [[Jason Kessler]] (who organized the [[Unite the Right rally]] in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017).

The Proud Boys have been involved in numerous violent street fights, and have been linked to several incidents of domestic terrorism, including the [[January 6th Insurrection]]. As of the time of writing, many nationally prominent Proud Boys are on trial for seditious conspiracy charges, related to their role in planning and inciting the insurrection.
