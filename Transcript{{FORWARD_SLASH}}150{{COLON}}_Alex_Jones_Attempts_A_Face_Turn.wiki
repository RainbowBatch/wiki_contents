Alex Jones' alliances and allegiances lie with Russia not with Trump. Oh yeah. But secondarily what this strike accomplishes is not like Alex isn't afraid of the fact that he attacked Syria or something like that. Which we're very much against. Oh absolutely. It's a dumb idea.

Yeah they're terrible. But Brian Williams actually go on air and suck Trump's dick this time. I'm not entirely sure. But the other thing. That fucking piece of shit. The other thing is that Trump's actions without a massive conspiracy to explain them like the his diet cokes are being poisoned with a slow acting nerve agent or whatever. Which they may be.

Alex has to realize that Trump's actions reveal to his audience that he's been lying about Trump for two years. Yeah. Like there's no other way around it. The idea of like Trump's on our side. I mean just the other day Trump came out and was like I think we might want to get back into the TPP. Yeah. Which is one of Alex's big banner issues with Trump. He's like he got us out of the TPP. We got to forgive everything he does. Which is a good thing.

I've looked I've looked into stuff and a lot of those a lot of those larger trade deals and stuff like that I don't fully understand because it's well you know the commerce. You know the tax bill. Yeah yeah. It's that. Oh good. Yeah. Not for it. So it's very simple. Alex people get all of this stuff. Alex tried to do tried to start didn't work and he tries again.
