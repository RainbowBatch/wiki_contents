    | timestamp = 00:04:12.000
    | text      = really. I just want to make sure that I'm clear. Okay, this is what I what I'm saying. Here we go. All right, this is Dan reading. In no way do we seek to minimize the seriousness of abuse against children. Nor are we in any way impugning the important work that law enforcement agencies do to fight against it. We acknowledge that pedophilia is real and a very serious problem in our society. And we don't pretend that we have any answers about the bigger picture questions regarding it. It is ours. And by ours, I mean me. It is my sole contention that Alex Jones, a documented propagandist and liar. This is Dan. I did not do a good job. Alex Jones is a documented propagandist and liar and in this episode, his behavior is not above board. and his actions absolutely serve to hurt the cause of protecting children. My contention, Jordan? Yeah, and I'm going to be laying out over the course of this episode. All right, is that Alex Jones intentionally put on a piece of staged propaganda, and he used his audience's understandable disgust and fear about pedophiles to exploit them. I believe that his motivations are threefold. One, he wanted to save face after everyone in the world, in publications, and on the internet, and in social conversations that I've had made fun of him for desperately trying to avoid a lawsuit over his coverage of pizza gate right to he wanted to sell more of his products, because I think he's going through an economic downturn because he's broke three. Finally, he wanted to perpetuate the myth that Donald Trump is working behind the scenes against a pedophile network. He's doing this because if that myth is accepted, it follows from that position that a pedophile network actually does exist.

    | name      = Jordan

    | text      = No, I mean, sometimes you have to laugh to not cry. But the reality is, I have cut out a lot of the really horrible stuff. So if you're worried that I we're going to be playing tons of clips of Alex, really just like a pig in mud rolling around and the filthiness that he believes is going on, I've cut out most of that stuff. It's not going to be graphic. Okay. But my contention will be borne out over a series of clips.

I've cut out a lot of like, extraneous parts where he tries to bring in how abortion is part of it too. And like celebrating the killing of children is what abortion is about. That's absolutely not. So I cut out a lot of complete nonsense to try and streamline my point, that I believe that this is all theater. And I think he knew it from the beginning of the show, to where the show ends.

He's not a mass murderer, right. Maybe he is. He's a former Navy SEAL. And well, then yeah, he's probably a mess. From all the research that I could do into his past. I didn't find like a ton of red flags. Like a lot of Alex's guests. There's not the like, weird, horrible track that I can find behind him. And so and he's, for what it's worth.

And so none of us have all the answers. I don't know exactly what to do. I just don't want to get the word out, move forward. We're gonna beat these people. But we're dealing with very, very, very, very wicked people. Trump has arrested it was 1800. A few weeks ago, it's over 3000 alleged pedophiles, but a lot of times it's not child porn. It's with the kids in cages, okay. And the big telltale sign is like California on February 2. KTLA biggest TV station, la 424, arrested 28 Kids in bondage, some of them in cages, nothing about the kids nothing about where they are now, nothing about what was going on this network. And I've seen this type article 1000s of times over the years. And so this is the real currency of the global so I don't know where we're even going here today other than a brainstorm session, about what we can do. And I know a lot separately. People are sick of this the military, they're tired of the Islamic takeover the globalist takeover out of the EU threatening to break the United States.

And Trump has let them off the chain. And that's why there are so many arrests now. Now, this theory and narrative is incredibly full of shit.

Hundreds of people were arrested and dozens of sexually exploited children and adult victims were rescued across California during a statewide operation to combat human trafficking. The LA Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced Tuesday, so that starts out with, you know, it does say dozens of sexually exploited children so Alex could have read that and gone from it. There's no indication of kids in bondage. There's no discussion of cages. None of that information is there, as best I can tell because I Googled it. I looked into this as deeply as I could. There is no stories anywhere Currently, about kids in cages. There are a couple stories from the last few years and they're all All massive parental child abuse stories. Okay, kids being saved from abusive parents, right? Those are the only stories I can find that involve cages. And and that's not to say that that's not horrifying, but it's not what Alex is talking about, right? It's at the very least bad parenting. So now, here's where Alex gets in trouble. The second paragraph, all right, more than 30 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and task forces, including the Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking Task Force, participated in the third annual operation reclaim and rebuild enforcement operation. According to the sheriff's news release. It's the third annual one. This has nothing to do with Trump.

    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:26:33.000
    | text      = here's why. I'll make your point for you. Yeah, this case in Memphis, 42 people were arrested in Memphis during a human trafficking operation led by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. 38 men and four women were arrested on prostitution related charges, agents posed for ads on Backpage for about 17 hours a day for three days. So that's how they lured people in. In some ads, undercover agents posed as a juvenile girl, eight men responded and paid to have sex with an underage female to those specifically paid money to have sex with 14 year old girls. Now, again, these people are creeps. But there's a fake victim involved. So you're not saving anybody, except for those people's hypothetical future victims, which is good, it is good. But the problem with a lot of stings like this is that those charges aren't going to stick necessarily. If you look at them, this article lists out all of the charges that these people got. And most of them are patronizing prostitution near a church or school. Oh, no, which is not a not a big offense, you know, not even go to prison for now. And here's my evidence that you won't go to prison for it. Anytime there was another charge. That was always dropped. They weren't charged with patronizing prostitution near a church or school, they were charged with, for instance, this guy charged with possession of cocaine, heroin and oxycodone, or this guy charged with having marijuana and cocaine. Those are the people who have actual charges aren't charged with the prostitution one, because they know it's a flimsy charge. So this

There can't be an interesting fight what it is, I mean, I'm squarely on the side of the gay organizations, but so they argue like the Human Rights Campaign, this guy Gregory King, said that Nambla is not a gay organization. They're not part of our community, and we thoroughly reject their efforts to insinuate the pedophilia is an issue related to gay and lesbian civil rights. I agree. Nambla says, Man Boy love is by definition homosexual. The western homosexual tradition from Socrates to wild to geed many non western homosexuality is from New Guinea to Persia to Zulu and the Japanese were formed by pederasty. And that man, boy lovers are part of the gay movement and central to gay history and culture.

Does that surprise you? Yeah, not many of us are willing to share our story for good reason. To confess a sexual attraction to children is to lay claim to the most reviled status on the planet, one that effectively ends any chance you have of living a normal life. Yet I'm not the monster you think me to be. I've never touched a child sexually in my life, and I never will. Nor do I use child pornography. But isn't that the definition of a pedophile? You may ask someone who molest children. Not really, although pedophile and child molester have been used interchangeably in the media there and there is some overlap at base. A pedophile is someone who is sexually attracted to children. That's it. There's no inherent reason he must act on those desires with real children. Some pedophiles certainly do, but many of us don't. Because the powerful taboo keeps us in hiding. It's impossible to know how many non offending pedophiles are out there. But signs indicate there are a lot of us. And too often we suffer in silence. That's why I decided to speak up. He goes on to call it a curse of the highest order and a massive handicap. Yeah.

Gender Dysphoria during childhood does not inevitably continue into adulthood. Rather, in follow up studies of pre pubertal children, mainly boys, who were referred to clinics for assessment of gender dysphoria that just dysphoria persisted into adulthood only for six to 23% of the children. Boys in these studies were more likely to identify as gay in adulthood then as transgender. Newer studies, including the also including girls showed a 12 to 27% persistence rate of gender dysphoria into adulthood. In contrast, the persistence of gender dysphoria into adulthood appears to be much higher for adolescents. No formal prospective studies exist. However, in a follow up study of 70 adolescents who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and given puberty suppressing hormones all continued with the actual sex reassignment beginning with feminizing masculinizing hormone therapy.

And the reason that it's important not to treat people like they're weird, or to feel like they're awful is because some people grow out of phases, and some people don't. And for some people, it's not even a phase, it's who they are. Right? And so when you have this 12 to 27%, that do persist into adulthood from the age of like, two, you can't, you can't be shitty to the 12 to 27%. You mean, you can't be shitty. So as a psychiatrist, shitty period, as a psychiatrist, it's your responsibility to protect those 12 to 27%, while at the same time acknowledging that as they get older, they may change. Yeah, and they may become Oh, no, see, I have to choose my words. Because it's not becoming okay with who you are. It's that acknowledging who you are, but it's the dysphoria is it goes away or whatever. It was just that for you remember that? What would it be? 84 to 63% of the population? 73? Whatever. Yeah.

That is very, that's something I really don't want to do. I don't want to minimize or take away from the reality of abuse against children. I only want to stress that Alex Jones is using it for his own game.

For all of that is in service to getting money? Well, sure. I don't think anything. I think any of that is all ancillary, the troll because he's done all of that shit before he can do all of that shit in any other episode. And you and I both know, he's done this pedophilia bullshit many times, not in not in the long form narrative that we're seeing now, not to this degree and not. And if that the only way to conclude that the reason that he put this to are the only conclusion I can draw, is that this is all a telethon. Yeah, this is the dark world version of a.

And I do believe that Alex, or someone in production knew that this fundraiser would get taken down and be able to be used exploitative labor. Yeah. The only other possibility I can come up with is that the storyline that they were gonna go with was, they launched this fundraiser, it raises tons of money. And then Alex can be like, I'm a part of this. Yeah. So support our show, because we're supporting this. Yeah. And that would still give them fundraising possibilities. And then when the fundraiser is taken down, he much like he has criticized Rahm Emanuel for saying does not let a good crisis go to waste. Now, I think it's possible that there is that he's like, oh, let's make hay while the sun shines. We can make a narrative out of this. Yeah, that's possible. I think it's more likely that he knew would get taken down. And that this was all a setup from the jump.

But again, like I think we agree, we need to cover the totality of Alex, we'll be back for another episode that won't be like this. We'll have one that will be a lot more fun and stupid, and what have you next time around. But until then, you can find us at our website over at knowledge fight.com. I'll have citations up there for the new stories that I referenced.
