And this is a bright spot, right? During COVID, the, during the pandemic, I think a lot of people transition from going to a therapist to like going on the phone if they have a therapist, or you know, using some kind of a virtual thing. And that's fine. But it I felt it was like kind of lacking in something. And I've just recently started going back to the physical location to see my therapist who I had been seeing throughout the panel. Yeah, of course, over the phone. And it's just, I mean, I don't know if it's the same for everybody. But for me, it's so much better. Yeah, it's it feels more like we're in a space that's meant for therapy. Yeah. And if there's an appointment ness to it, there's there's an ability to be a little bit more open and raw, because it's not talking into a phone.

I did a little Googling and we went on TripAdvisor and as it turns out, the Royal semester resort is a place where you need a wristband to use the pool. It's apparently also a room key like it works as a key but that argument like you know that he had it on all the time and should use it as a key. Sure it doesn't really work for me because he wasn't wearing it and the other days that he did the show, I think he was skipping out on the show because he wanted to go to the pool. And he but he needed to pop back in and complain about how they needed more money to these trips to the pool.

And what he thought was best and most time it totally screwed him up, because they had planned responses that someone in the system would would would would respond to, which was already pre programmed at actuary. So they knew how to react to someone operating from the program matrix. But because Trump's operating off of his Spirit, His instincts even though he's got a flawed template he's operating off of it's still so much more advanced in their operation, that they go this guy is just an unstoppable that's why in all their lawsuits against me, they're like, give us the secret data, the intelligence agency programming you let us know who's funding you let us know who comes up with all this. We know you've got somebody telling what to do. They cannot understand that like Luke Skywalker, I've turned off the targeting computer that just blew up the Deathstar. Because what God gave me is way more powerful than this technological junk that used to turn worship all day that just simply templates what we already are. The AI doesn't do anything, steals it plagiarizes and we all look at so incredible, because it's showing us ourselves back. We are incredible. So that is my message to everybody to understand that Trump is not intellectual. He has his ideas. He has his gut. He has his beliefs about what's right, and what's fair and business. But notice the Chinese would meet with him whenever he wanted. He was able to meet you, sir. Well, he was right now he's up. I'll fly to you. Because they recognize okay, this guy is in charge. GGP is a dictator and evil. He respects himself, though he climbed up from nothing betrayed his own family to a death camp to be in charge. Plus a member of the party. He respects his power, he's in charge. That's why he totally shut down big tech in China. And they kicked Trump out and stole the election. He said at a big event. Two years ago to the Communist Chinese. We got to take over big tech. They're out of control. We're done. They want to do this to us. They're not doing to us. Well, they need to Trump but they actually respected they were talking to the boss. They won't meet with Biden are representative now. They will meet with her defense because they know they're like, hey, we want to meet with Larry Fink. We want to meet with Elon Musk want to meet with Bill Gates.

So strange cat, it's tough to live like that. It must be. Yeah. So the rest of the episode takes on a bit of a character that I wasn't expecting. And I think that we all kind of have understood the strategy and how it will evolve. As as things have gone along. For instance, the rolling back of Roe v. Wade, and attacking of trans people's rights. These are things that are bad in and of themselves, but also belie what are the next things that the the conservative movement, for lack of a better word is going to do. It's going to escalate, there's going to be continuing rollback of progress and rights that people have fought for over the years. Yeah. And particularly, you could tell that rights just generally for homosexual existence. Yeah, we're going to be under attack. Yeah, absolutely. The right to marry obviously, is one of those battle fronts. But if you're going based on the rhetoric that's flying around on Infowars right now, the goal that Alex and his army and seem to be interested in is outlawing being gay. Yeah. And that becomes something that callers are espousing. And Alex is on board with, which is unbelievable.

Yeah, the entire time that I've been a conscious human. Right, you know, and right. And, you know, trans existence has been something that has been marginalized and threatened my entire life. But the awareness of those issues are more reset, and they are more things that feel like it's a fight that we're still participating in, bringing to a point where there is, is more equality or, you know, it feels like something a battle that is still ongoing. Yeah. As opposed to the situation with the right to be gay. That feels like a closed chapter. Right. And I don't know, there's so many weird feelings mixed up in it.
