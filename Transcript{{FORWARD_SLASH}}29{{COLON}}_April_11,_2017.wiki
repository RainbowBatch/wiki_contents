This is fortune smiling upon me. Oh, all right. This whole week? Uh huh. The last couple of days Sunday through Tuesday, have been essentially, Alex talking about Syria being a false flag. Right, insisting that every piece of evidence backs him up. He talks about how like even Putin said it's a false flag. Oh, great. Oh, great. Cool. I buy it. Yeah, great source.

He ended his tour of duty or whatever, in 2006. And he is basically saying that because Trump has bombed them after a gas attack, it gives any ISIS members they're a really good motivation to fake another one. If they want to lure us into war, right? He says that that's what the interviewer says. Alex Jones insists that this is proof that the gas attack that has happened is a false flag. And that this guy, this Ambassador to Syria is even saying it, which isn't technically true. It's sort of implied, but he doesn't actually say that. Okay, further, I did a little looking into this ambassador's past. And he has been roundly criticized by tons of organizations for being pro Assad. Really, he is very partial. He

    | text      = actually, Mike Cernovich has an interesting theory about that. Excellent. Mike Cernovich was on last week or so. And he was breaking a big scoop. And that is that the pedophile army Oh, the globalist elite pedophile army have compromised the people who give out security clearances. So the reason that all of the jobs in the government aren't staffed. It isn't because Trump hasn't nominated anybody for those positions, which he hasn't. He has not it's because whenever he does try and nominate somebody, these globalist pedophile elite controlled security clearance people are like, no, no, no, no, you're a patriot. Get out of here.
