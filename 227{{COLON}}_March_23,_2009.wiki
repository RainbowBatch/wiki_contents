Today, Dan and Jordan continue examining Alex Jones' path through 2009. He's been completely obsessed with dishonestly portraying "the patriots" as being under attack from all sides, and this episode is nothing if not a continuation of that trend. Also, apparently G.I. Joe is "Globalist propaganda."
