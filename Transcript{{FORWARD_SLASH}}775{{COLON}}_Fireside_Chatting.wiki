And so obviously I need a little something to watch. I've been needing to find some entertainment, of course, and I was poking around on YouTube and I managed to find there's a new season of Australian survivor Oh, Australian survivor Heroes vs villain. All right, all right. And man I gotta say maybe I'm like a traitor to the United States. Like they're they have no business making such a better version of survival. Why it's night and day so much better

There are characters on there that I don't like that I still enjoy watching. Whereas with the American version, this last season, I was having a real hard time getting a hold anywhere. Yeah, finding anybody to care about all right season. Well, that's fair. But yeah, it's just good. And here I was thinking about it. And like, what could it possibly be? That's the difference.

And so like your water when there's more of it? Well, you know, that's the season where you have to compete against or with a family. But yes, yeah, those are things that they took from the American survivor, but just, I don't know, less membership. And then also this, I noticed this, that I love, and that is that on Australian survivor, they split every episode has a reward challenge and a immunity challenge. Ah, like classic survivor, okay. In the American version, it's always BOTH Yeah, they just have one big thing. And it's almost always a big course that you have to run through or something that's annoying. And then there's a puzzle, right? And then you get a reward and immunity. And it's like, I don't know, this is it's just like, I don't do you want to maximize that much of time of people just sitting around? Sure. And maybe that is what they want to maximize.

It couldn't be more obvious, right. And on the one level, that's interesting, but then on another level, there is this weird thing where he and like SPOILER ALERT Mike Adams sense of showing up at some point by the fire. Okay, but they have this, like, you have such freedom now like, what freedom Didn't you have before? That's crazy, like you can finally talk. You could have done whatever. But at the same time I get it. Yeah, Alex was trapped in his own like self made prison planet drew in the Infowars studio and there is some sort of a weird comfort that he probably has, like escaping and doing like, Ah, I'm in my home studio recording me just saying whatever the fuck I want.

The interaction between you and this therapist, if you're talking about going to work, then you're working for somebody probably right? I Alex didn't have a boss, he would just do whatever he wanted. And yet that was too confining for him because of these errors that he made along the way. didn't create, like his fantasy land where, you know, free speech rained, and everybody was hooray. Right?

What a combination of places the European Union and San Francisco well, they are sister countries, so on the subject of them banning and fireplaces. He has an article from a website called Green zones.eu From last April titled quote, old fireplaces soon banned. Green zones.eu is a website that sells environmental stickers you can put on your car, and also happens to have a blog most likely for SEO purposes. So idiots like Google, like Alex googling keywords like band and fireplace will land on their page and get more traffic. This the use of this is one of the main sources that Alex has gone with it shows a lack of seriousness on his part, every time this Fireside Chat is not being done by a professional Fireside Chat.

Quote, It is bizarre in the extreme to think that air pollution in the UK is being laid fairly and squarely at the door of the wood burning stove industry. Governments conveniently ignore coal powered power stations ignore the harmful emissions from diesel and petrol vehicles and the limited progress on pushing electric cars. I'm guessing if Alex looked at this piece past the headline, he would join me in grading the sources worthless and from a heavily biased source in the real world, according to a February 2023 article in The Guardian, so it's just this month right after the UK passed rules allowing English councils to find people 300 pounds for using wood burning stoves that cause smoke to affect neighbors. These councils have, quote issued only 17 fines over six years, despite more than 18,000 complaints. But I guess it's good that Alex considers himself the tip of the spear because his research consists of skimming articles about air pollution written by fireplace salesmen.

    | timestamp = 00:23:08.000
    | text      = it's a tough fight to get excited about not doing stoves man. So the next article that Alex uses is from construction dive. And this article was published in 2015. The headline is, quote, San Francisco Bay Area bans wood burning devices and all new home construction. This is a blog geared at delivering the latest news in the world of construction, which I didn't realize was a big part of Alex's media diet, so much so that he's pulling out this eight year old article about San Francisco passing a regulation that prohibited woodburning devices in new home. Honestly, that regulation sounds reasonable. And the article even discusses how you could get a gas fake lug thing for your fireplace. I don't understand that any of this has to do with the larger theme of trying to take away energy or fires place in humanity. Right. So now, when Alex starts talking about Biden in the gas stoves ship, he uses one CNN article that's just reporting that a member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission suggested a regulation that was worth considering. But then he uses another headline, quote, Biden administration announces intent to ban gas stoves. That headline is way more severe. And if you blink, you might miss the source on that which might have been intentional. The name of the outlet is just in the corner of the screen and zooms out of you pretty quick. This is a post from the American Energy Alliance, which is a lobbying arm of the Institute for Energy Research. The group has deep ties to the Koch family between hundreds of 1000s and probably millions of dollars of funding. And a former Koch oil lobbyists Tom pile at one time serving as president of both the American Energy Alliance and the Institute for Energy Research. Long and short. This is an oil industry lobbying press release and Alex is trying to pass it off to his audience as news or research. Not a great look how many of these sources he's using are just PR shit from lobbyists in the fields that stand to make less money if climate change is taken. Seriously. Yeah, yeah. See? seems shoddy

Obviously, this isn't comparable in any way. But it does raise an interesting question. Why don't most houses heat their themselves with coal anymore? It was once a dominant home heating method. But according to NPR, by 2019, only 130,000 households in the United States use coal for heat that represents less than 1/10 of 1% of homes. And because burning coal in the home sucked. It created heat really well, but it was disgusting and toxic. And once other heating methods were discovered and popularized, shit got updated. That's what's going on again, now. People are reassessing if the things that we accepted as normal are as safe as we think. Alex isn't a full on Tailspin about this stuff. Because he has strong feelings about the oil and coal industries. For some reason. It could be that he has secret backing, or it could be just as easy the case that everyone in the right wing media does they have that backing? Yep.

    | text      = This is of course, total bullshit. David Rockefeller wrote an op ed in the New York Times in 1973, called from a China traveler that Alex constantly lies about. Yeah, it is true that he says this in the article, quote, the social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history. The social experiment he's talking about is the process of shifting from a long standing policy of largely inward focus to one that involves the rest of the world. And that does seem fairly important. Yeah, there's a lot of criticism you Did lob at Rockefeller for this op ed, and it's unclear how much he was aware about Mao's leadership qualities is lesser leadership qualities. But one thing that does bear mentioning is that the Op Ed also included some critical thoughts. For instance, it recognizes some negative things like, quote, freedom to travel or change jobs is restricted. When asked about personal creativity, one ceramics craftsman answered only that there was not time for individual art if the masses were to be served. Like there is a not just total positive image that Rockefeller paints in that op ed right. Either way, it's quite important to note that the great reset and the Great Leap Forward are completely different things with completely different goals and ideas. They both have the word great in them, and Alex can use them to scare the audience, but they aren't related. The Great Leap Forward was a plan that Mao put into place to quickly industrialized China beginning in the late 50s. The great reset is not even a solid plan, but a call from Klaus Schwab to consider how coming technological advances will be disruptive to the status quo, and we should be able to rise to the challenge that they present, I would actually argue that there's a decent position, you could stake that the Great Leap Forward is antithetical to the ideas of the great reset in as much as it was about industrialization as quickly as possible, like ramping up steel production, sure. And like the consequences of that, from a from an ecological perspective are huge. Where a great deal of the focus, especially the people like Alex, point to in terms of great reset, related ideas have to do with diminishing this impact in this negative ecological damage.

Yeah, Alex constantly brings up the carbon cycle and says that it describes the sun, co2, oxygen and water being the things that are needed to have life on the planet. Sure, this isn't exactly true. I mean, it is true that you need those things to have life ship. The carbon cycle itself is an argument against Alex's idea about energy consumption. It is true that the carbon cycle includes those things and as much as plants take in co2 to do photosynthesis, and the oceans absorb co2 From the air, some of which is then released into the air by the sun's energy evaporating water, and the like. This is a generous explanation of the carbon cycle meant to accommodate Alex and his points. But even so, the cycle relies on equilibrium. If way more co2 is being released into the atmosphere, then the atmosphere can reintegrate into the cycle like being absorbed by plants, that's an issue. This is where our human involvement in the carbon cycle comes into play, which Alex just ignores. And it's because we burn all these fossil fuels, and by doing so we contribute tons more co2 into the cycle than the cycle can handle. And thus it ends up in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. Even if everything Alex is saying about his description of the carbon cycle is true, it does nothing to rebut the arguments of climate scientists. It can be the same cycle Alex is describing, but one side of the equation is totally out of balance. And that has consequences.

    | text      = this is profoundly stupid and honestly should be seen as an indication that Alex doesn't know very basic facts or is intentionally misleading the audience in order to get them to blindly support the fossil fuel industry. As for the Keystone pipeline, there are a couple of important things to bring up here. The first is that Biden revoke the permit for an expansion of the Keystone pipeline. There is an existing system in place that transports tar sands oil to refineries, the leg of the expansion that Alex is talking about the one that ends in Port Arthur, Texas was actually completed and is in operation. It's just called the Gulf Coast pipeline. So Alex doesn't even know. Right, right. Related or it exists. What was at issue and the aspect of the pipeline that most people are aware of is the northern leg, which would have cut through Nebraska, South Dakota and Montana. It's completely different section of it. That did not get completed. Yeah. And I mean, just it's staggering that Alex De brings up Port Arthur, Texas. Yeah, and he doesn't even know that that is done. And but there's oil in them. That doesn't make you angry. DREW. Second, Alex's number is incredibly exaggerated. Oh, what's the entire country of Canada produces less than 6 million barrels of oil a day. So the notion that this pipeline would be transporting 30 million a day is absurd. Third, the response to the expansion being canceled has not been to transport by rail, this this ship to China. That's so dumb. We're talking about tar sands oil from Alberta here, which is very difficult to transport, except it's slightly easier through pipes, it would not be economically viable to transport the tar sands by rail and then send by boat to China, who would then still have to refine it to make it usable as an energy source. It didn't nobody has financial interest to do that. Alex knows nothing about the Keystone pipeline is just repeating oil lobby talking points, either because he's told to or because he sees all his friends doing it. And he's virtue signaling that he's one of them. He's one of those people who will do anything and lie and No,

So first is Charlie Kirk, someone who Alex has attacked a ton in the past. As one of the people who's in the Ben Shapiro type soft conservative community be by God. The reason that Nick Fuentes came into Alex's life at all in the first place was largely because Nick and the groupers were having a war with Kirk and turning point so it's kind of funny to see him in this video. Then there's MTG who the far right who are Alex's fan base have turned against because she sided with Kevin McCarthy and the speakership fight. She's now largely seen as a sellout by the extreme right wing, who much prefer Lauren bowburn style of trolling. Marjorie's white balloon shaped with the State of the Union the other day was unspeakable levels of embarrassing. Then there's Rogen who won't have Alex back on his show, and also as a complete idiot who has been caught relaying multiple fake stories in the past few months, with at least one instance of them where he learned in real time on his show that the story he was telling as a hoax. If anything, Rogen saying that actually Alex is right about more than he's wrong. That should make a person question if Alex is actually right, more than he's wrong. It's not a reliable source is what I'm saying. Then there's Mike Flynn, Mike Flynn knows and unregistered foreign agent while serving as Trump campaigns national security adviser and he pled guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts he had with members of the Russian government but then withdrew his plea and then got pardoned by Trump. He's either willfully or negligently promoted a ton of Q anon conspiracies and now he's championing a Christian fascist movement. Oh, I'm sorry. A Christian nationalist. Yeah, no, no,

I want to spit ball around some ideas what these offers could be shit. Here are the major figures in this media space that could possibly offer Alex anywhere close to the amount of money he would be demanding and require him to move. Well, I'm just gonna go all across your short for now go for the blaze, which you probably wouldn't have to move for. So I think that one is just like he's that's in Texas. Yeah. Daily wire. Oh, ACN and Frank speech. There just aren't other conservative networks that could be in his ballpark except for maybe if you force it to get to five you could say like right side broadcasting, but I don't think they have the money. The thing about four of them requiring them to move sounds like bullshit. I don't even feel like entertaining it because it's more confusing than Interesting. Yeah, Alex and Glenn Beck could never coexist in the same business. So the Blaze is just not possible. Also, they would have an advertiser Exodus if they brought on Alex, so it's very unlikely. Same problem with the daily wire. They just had this big public falling out with Steven Crowder and Alex is 100 times more toxic than Crowder ever could be. signing on. Alex, who actively hates multiple members of the daily wire team is way more than it's worth. So I don't believe it's gonna happen. I wouldn't recommend ended Oh en and Frank speech definitely seem possible. Alex could become the main anchor at OA en until he has some kind of a disagreement with management and decides that they're the deep state couple that is deep within OA n and then he gets himself fired maximum. Frank speech is a good fit since Michael Sandel seems to have endless money and no standards. So that's a possibility. Yeah. wouldn't need to move though. Everything is remote. Yeah. Then the other possibility is Rebel rebel media. Sure. But I don't. They're not really. I don't know if they could afford him. I don't know what kind of money would be there.

It is failing because of the efforts of the infant warriors and Alex Jones and myself and others, I mean, many, many people 1000s of people sounding the alarm. And because of that, the globalists have realized they can't achieve their kill quotas. So yes, they have killed quotas. Every national leader has been given a you must kill off 70% of the population or maybe only 60, but it's a big percentage of the population. And the United States is not going to reach that kill quota through these existing doors. It's so disappointing have to resort to the next stage sure of the global depopulation effort and what is that? Well, of course it's provoking Russia into a nuclear attack on the United States.

That's going to lead to massive uprisings and violent revolts in America. And that will exacerbate the population die off that's happening at the same time there is some food scarcity. But you see what I want you to understand. If you're watching this in the United States, you're not going to go to the grocery store and see all the shelves empty. It won't be that way. There will be some food scarcity here, not enough to kill you by itself. But that What are you talking about scarcity, combined with the social unrest, combined with perhaps an escalation of war with Russia, and then combined with cyber warfare attacks on the financial infrastructure that takes down even the power grid or regional sections of the power grid that and that takes down banking takes down food stamps, takes down ATMs, so that the people start to panic, they freak out, they don't have anybody to come to their rescue. And that's when the panic population goes into a kind of a violent overdrive situation. And you get massive violence and die offs in the cities with no one coming to their rescue. That's the scenario that they're trying to create. Now, then, when that happens, the government will try to confiscate food from farms and rural areas, and then shift it into the cities, because they want to keep the left wing Democrats alive if they can, relative to the country, conservatives, that they're definitely trying to kill off more quickly.
