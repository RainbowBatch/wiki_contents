[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwayne_Johnson Dwayne Douglas Johnson] (born May 2, 1972), aka The Rock, is an American-Canadian actor, producer, football player, and pro wrestler. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he was part of the WWE during the "boom period" in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for WWF/E for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His films have made him one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.

In Episode #117 Alex discusses The Rock in comparison to Oprah.  While Alex detests [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s supposed political aspirations, he is supportive of Dwayne Johnson.  Alex admits that this is primarily because The Rock is a Republican.  Alex advises Johnson to abandon Hollywood because it is "like poison that we are vomiting out of us".  Dan and Jordan discuss and play clips from The Rock's appearance at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
