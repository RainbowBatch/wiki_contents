Today, Dan and Jordan wrap up trial coverage by looking at how Alex responded to the news of his punitive damages judgment.  Bad news: it's a lot of Bobby Barnes.  Good news: the gents meet Willford Snibble-Snabble of the Gribble-Pibble.

Dan stated that [[Tina Peters]] was an election official in Mesa, AZ. Mesa is a city, not a county. Tina Peters was an election official in Mesa County, Colorado.<ref>https://twitter.com/knowledge_fight/status/1558526516195217408?s=21&t=jqPg6YOXafNRGSJ_NCzg5Q</ref>
