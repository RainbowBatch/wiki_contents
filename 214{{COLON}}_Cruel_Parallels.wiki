Today, Dan and Jordan discuss some curious thematic similarities between the broadcasts Alex Jones did during the Kavanaugh confirmation vote and during the 2016 election. While both were ostensibly about a major political event, each was really about celebrating cruelty and spouting closed-minded nonsense.

*Women: It's all your fault
*This will be a day to remember. We'll see the end of Hillary, then Soros
*We're awake now
*Alex always talks about people peeing on him
*If Hillary wins, she nukes Russia
*We will win, but billions will die
*Women protestors are mad at their dads
*We don't want to rape your kids, that's why we have free shipping
*I'd be more successful if I was evil
*Darren McBreen wants to see people cry
*Alex replays leftists crying at election because they don't cry for Kavanaugh
*Election night: out forbears gave you the right to vote. Now you do this to us
*Discussion: Voting rights history
*"You" is white people who go against Alex
*Democrats are rioting over Kavanaugh
*Dems won't be happy until you kill them
