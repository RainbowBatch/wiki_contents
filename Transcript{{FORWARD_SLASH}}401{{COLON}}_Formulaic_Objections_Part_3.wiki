So Jordan, I don't know if you know this, what don't I know. But back in February 2019, Jerome Corsi filed a lawsuit against Roger Stone deed he did. He claimed defamation among other complaints. This was the ultimate result of the two men's collaboration during the 2016 campaign where of course he and Roger were working together to try to get in touch with Julian Assange. Now we've heard Alex Jones say on air multiple times that he explicitly told Roger to get in touch with Assange. And both corsi and Roger were working at Infowars. At the time, we're working with them at very least, but it might be too much of a stretch to say that the two men's actions were being done specifically at the order of Alex. That's fair. Yeah. Because he's an idiot. Whatever the case, when you work with Roger Stone, things tend to not go great for you. It's super rare for people to walk away without some kind of darkness looming over their lives, if they're lucky to not get arrested. At the center of the falling out that the two of them had was the tweet that Roger posted on August 21 2016. That said, quote, trust me there will soon be Podesta as time in the barrel hashtag crooked Hillary. This tweet predated the release of the hacked Podesta emails, and based on all available information, it predated anyone outside of WikiLeaks knew knowing that they were going to be released. According to Corsi, a couple of days after Roger posted that tweet, Roger asked corsi to draft a memo that he could use as a cover story for why he tweeted something he should have no business knowing about right, right, right. This memo was allegedly about how Roger wrote that tweet based on research the course he had been doing on quote Podesta and Hillary's alleged relationship with Russian companies,

Of course, he came out by late 2018 and admitted that the memo he'd written was a lie, and was made specifically to explain why Roger posted that tweet. Yeah. After course, he came out and made some comments that were not looking good for Roger who was about to be indicted by Muller. As the story he told in interviews with investigators was coming a bit unraveled. Roger went on the attack against Jerome Corsi. He started talking shit about him on Infowars which if your course you kind of should have expected Yeah, I like course he worked for Alex he knows that there's no rules about responsibility that are practiced at Infowars Nikolas

So Roger railed on corsi on air and and social media alleging the course he was working with Muller to jam him up. Of course, he claimed that these attacks had resulted in him suffering quote, intentional infliction of emotional distress and assault. An article. An article in Newsweek says that course he claimed Roger quote, carried out a campaign of threats against him to cause him to have heart attacks and strokes in order that plaintiff will be unable to testify at stones criminal trial. Good dodge. Course, he claimed that Roger was doing this sort of intimidation because he fancied himself a little bit of a gangster type and he loved the mafia. This argument gains a little credibility based on the fact that one of the Rogers charges in the Muller case was related to witness intimidation directed towards Randy credico, the other person Roger tried to use as a scapegoat to explain his advanced knowledge of the Podesta emails his

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 11:25
    | text      = So the basic plot, of course, you suit is that based on his being named as a material witness and considering the things that he knew about Roger, he believed that Rogers actions were an attempt to intimidate him out of cooperating with the case against Roger. In the process, Roger was defaming course you in order to smear him and make his testimony seem less credible, or even make it appear the course he was the criminal behind this whole thing all along? Yeah. The initial filing of the lawsuit lists the defamatory statements. And honestly, it just sounds like Roger being Roger. Now, having said that's defamatory. Illegal for Roger just to be Roger.

And honestly, I have a hard time believing that this suit would even have gotten to a trial. The claim defamatory statements seem as best as I can tell it to be things that would be easy to claim or opinions. But that's a matter for a judge. And, you know, I can't I'm not going to make a decision. In his lawsuit. Of course, he decided to hire for his lawyer another person who has been slighted by Infowars a man by the name of Larry Clayman. Hey, you may remember him as the guy who wouldn't stop yelling about how Obama was trying to bring Ebola into the country to attack White people. And as the lawyer representing Dennis Montgomery, the guy who was working with Sheriff Joe Arpaio on some shady business that everyone decided to pretend was proof that Trump was being spied on. In terms of the places I've come across claiming I will say that he has not impressed me much. I wouldn't hire him as my lawyer and it does not look great when you see people who

I don't think that one's gonna go well, for George. No, one's disgusting. But it's not the most disgusting thing that Larry Clayman has done with George Zimmerman.

And also, that image of him being quote, pathologically litigious kind of comes into play in the course of the situation, because as soon as corsi sued Roger with claimant as his lawyer, Roger started attacking both of them calling into question claiming his ability as a lawyer and saying he had a low IQ. Sure. And what do you know, Larry Clayman turned around and sued Roger along with course that also sounds right. They're both claiming defamation against him.

Roger probably definitely said some untrue things about both corsi and Clayman. So if he gets in trouble for it, who cares? Also, if he gets away with it, of course, he can claim and both suck. So I don't really care here. The only outcome of this no matter how it goes is that both sides end up wasting resources fighting with each other. And that's all right in my book. Fantastic. So we've seen how Alex Jones, Rob do and Paul Joseph Watson behave when they're forced to be under oath. And in a deposition, they change completely. I need to play dumb or pretend to be serious, right now it's time to experience Roger Stone on the road, which I'll say is very similar to Roger Stone anywhere else. Yeah, this dude does not give a fuck. So begins by, you know, talking about some of Rogers history. And you know, like his educational background and then working for some presidential campaigns. And it was, you know, what, I never realized I should probably should have known this. And I bet I did. I just didn't, didn't remember, he didn't graduate from college. He didn't know he like went to a year of college and then started working for Nixon, God, you can be whatever you want to be pretty remarkable to me that he doesn't have some sort of degree or some formal training in political science.

And things got a little messy when the National Enquirer reported on how he posted ads and scandalous pictures of himself and his wife in swingers magazines, and online looking to get some fun going. Roger initially blamed an imaginary assistant for posting the ads but eventually copped to the fact that he had done it. When he finally did come clean, he was still kind of a weasel about it saying, quote, when that whole thing hit the fan in 1996, the reason I gave a blanket denial was that my grandparents were still alive. I am not guilty of hypocrisy.

And so much of the right wing attacks on Bill Clinton had to do with him and his women womanizing, so this would be a bad look for dole to have a senior adviser who was out swinging, particularly considering that according to the Chicago Tribune, Roger was part of Bob Dole is quote, Clinton accountability team. Yep. And thus by September of 96, Roger had stepped down from the dole campaign. I don't really care about Roger swinging, you know, that's his business. But for him, I do think that his response to the Enquirer story speaks a lot to his character. I understand the culture wasn't accepting of people living alternative lifestyles at that point, but the length that he went to pretend that he had been set up were pretty ridiculous. Anyway, Roger threatened to sue the Enquirer. And Larry Clayman was his lawyer and that great, great, great. So back in 96, right. That was where Roger is saying their paths first crossed, right, right, right. But because there was no imagined perpetrator to sue here, Roger was lying about that. And there was no libel on the part of the Enquirer. This case went nowhere. And Roger took a pretty big hit to his credibility. Consider he was a college dropout, who went to work on shady shit for Richard Nixon. He'd worked for Reagan, he was an advisor for Bob Dole, these his big leagues in the GOP circles politics. But after the scandal, he went down the fight card a little bit. His profile just didn't match with presidential candidates. And thus, in 2004, Roger was enlisted to advise a certain candidate on their run for a Florida seat in the US Senate candidate was Larry Clayman,

According to this article Larry's adventures at Judicial Watch where he would file tons of lawsuits mostly against people in the Clinton orbit. They were funded by Richard Mellon Scaife, the right wing billionaire mega donor. According to this article, claiming sought funding from Scaife for his Senate run in a letter that said, quote, as a senator, I will have considerable powers that I did not have a Judicial Watch, including the ability to investigate and prosecute in the Senate, Hillary Clinton, much like Richard Nixon did with the communist spy, Alger Hiss.

Yes, but seeing as it was 16 years ago, I'm not really going to get bogged down in that question, Shawn, I'm not really interested, because the answer is yes. The important thing for us today is that the reason that Larry needed money is because the only way he could fund his campaign was through soliciting donations through direct mailings. And he didn't have access to a large database of names in order to target those mailings. When you're in that situation, you know, you don't have a giant mailing list, you need to pay for access to other people's lists of names, as Clayman was doing with the list held by American target advertising. The problem was, according to this article, that he was spending almost as much as he was bringing in with a strategy, so that wasn't going to cut it. And

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 43:58
    | text      = No. I tried to look into that. And that has something to do with divorce filing and Larry's past. I have no idea what the circumstances that are. Yeah, I'm not even gonna go anywhere now. The only explanation I can find for that sexual harassment business. It comes from a 2009 lawsuit that Larry had filed against Judicial Watch and its new president Tom Fitton. It was a rangy lawsuit claiming breach of contract defamation and other such grievances. Part of Larry's argument was that Fitton and Judicial Watch had committed fraud and the trial because they had testified that he was ousted from Judicial Watch because of a sexual harassment claim. But Larry had a deposition from Tom Fitton, saying that Larry was not quote, ousted as a result of a sexual harassment complaint. This argument did not move the court from the memorandum opinion in the case quote, claimant has not identified any fitness testimony at trial contradicting the quoted deposition testimony or suggesting the claimant was quote outed as a result of a sexual harassment complaint. He references only testimony of Paul or affinities in addressing Mr. profanities is understanding of why claiming left Judicial Watch. Nowhere in his testimony did Mr. profanities state that claim and left Judicial Watch due to a sexual harassment complaint. He testified the claim and left Judicial Watch, in part to avoid, quote, an internal investigation into whether he Clayman pursued an inappropriate relationship with an employee, and at most explained his concern that Judicial Watch might have been subjected to sexual harassment allegations based on that alleged relationship. Gotcha. It seems like this is the best explanation I can find for that situation. It looks like it's a thing where Paul or vanities, who was a lawyer, a Judicial Watch had testified the claimant had a relationship with an employee, but didn't say that there was a sexual harassment complaint. It seems like maybe this became a bit of a game of telephone from there since claimant got a bit defensive about it in the court case. Part of claimants claim of defamation against Roger is that Roger said on Infowars that he was ousted a Judicial Watch, asked Tom Fitton, why he left he was outed because of a sexual harassment complaint, which is not something Roger could probably substantiate. That does make it an inaccurate statement presented as fact. But I also don't know if Larry can prove that Roger didn't know it was true when he said it. It's really hard thing to tell with an asshole like Roger. Yeah, because this is something that people talk about. Yeah. Like I've seen the claim repeated a bunch of places. It took a while to find that case, where that this like this probably came from right. But,

Sickler was apparently in need of an experimental cancer surgery that was to be performed by a doctor Elliot Mendelsohn. Of course, he claimed that Mendelssohn had quote, cured his relatives stage four liver cancer, and that Tommy could be saved with his operation as well, but he needed the money to make it happen. Apparently, that GoFundMe raised over $25,000 But there were some issues that came up when it got looked into a little bit. According to the Daily Caller, they did some digging and found that the link that was provided by corsi to Dr. Mendelssohn's clinic directed people to the website of Mendelssohn Consulting Group, the registered owner of which was mysteriously Tommy Sickler. That is certainly a pretty big red flag. And the guy who needs money for this miracle surgery happened to also be the owner of the miracle surgeons business,

It was alleged that Mendelssohn also had a practice in Boca Raton, Florida, but there was no one by that name and the Florida physician licensing database.

This is something that had to have come out of the closed door interviews with corsi now that they're suing Roger, the claim is that Roger used his connections at The Daily Caller. And it's friendship with Tucker Carlson to plant the story to attack corsi. And here's the thing, a move like that wouldn't surprise me one bit from Roger, the claimant is just saying that it's the case. There's no evidence at all. It seems like you know, we've already talked about this, but the strategy is just to make accusations and hope Roger will catch fess.

Of course he was. The second problem is that in July 2018, Trump did pardoned Dwight and Steven Hammond, Amman and Cliven Bundy. Their cases ended in a mistrial. So they're not even in jail.

And thus, they're making them toxic to those outlets, and it would hurt their reach. It seems to me mostly because what Roger is saying or Larry's saying doesn't make much sense that this line of questioning feels like him trying to do that same thing to Roger to paint him as a turncoat to the Bundys noted heroes of the fringe conservative world.
