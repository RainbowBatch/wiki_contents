The '''John Birch Society''' is a far-right, [[anti-Communist]] organization founded in 1958 by [[Robert W. Welch Jr]]. The organization is named after John Birch, a Baptist missionary and American military intelligence officer who was killed by Chinese communists in 1945. Birch himself had no direct relation to the society or its founders.

The society is known for its extreme views and conspiracy theories, including beliefs that the United Nations, the federal government, and other international organizations are part of a global communist conspiracy. The society was also criticized for its opposition to civil rights and its support of segregation.

The JBS has declined in membership and influence since the 1960s, but it remains active. Many current and former JBS members and their children, such as [[Joel Skousen]], remain influential in the far-right. [[Alex Jones]]'s father, [[David Jones]], may have been a member -- Alex has claimed slightly contradictory things during the course of his show. Regardless of membership, Alex has clearly stated that he grew up surrounded by JBS literature and that his father and his friends frequently discussed it.
