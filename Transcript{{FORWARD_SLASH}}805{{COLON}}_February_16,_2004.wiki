And Hutton Gibson is an expert. He's been exposing it for decades on the takeover of the Roman Catholic Church, by the forces of the New World Order. We'll be talking about that and other issues in the third hour today.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:08:18.000
    | text      = Very exciting. So Hudson Gibson is not so much an expert on issues related to the Catholic Church as much as he is an extremist against the Catholic Church post Second Vatican Council Chair, he's among the many anti Semite to have very serious problems with some of the changes that the council made regarding church doctrine. One of the large issues that folks like cotton have, has its involved with the no strike at a agitate document, which among other things, specifically condemned the charges of deicide which people have levied against Jewish people, which is the accusation that Jews bear the responsibility for killing the Christian savior. Right. In that declaration, it said, quote, it is true that the church is the new people of God, yet the Jews should not be spoken of as rejected or accursed, as if this follows from Holy Scripture, and went on to say, quote, The Church reproves every form of persecution against whomsoever it may be directed, remembering, then it's common heritage with the Jews and moved not by any political consideration, but solely by religious motivation of Christian charity. It deplores all hatreds, persecutions, displays of anti semitism directed against the Jews at any time or from any source. This is why Hutton Gibson said that Vatican two is quote, a Masonic plot backed by the Jews. These are the words of someone who Alex is presenting to his audience as an expert. And there are really only two possible explanations, either this is the kind of rhetoric Alex wants to promote, or he's so desperate to be in the proximity of someone who's related to a celebrity that he'll launder this kind of extreme anti semitism in order to make that association. Yeah, and I don't care which it is.

    | text      = Yeah, I I'm just not going to be I'm not going to be a compelled by the evidence of the father of a movie star, who just hates Catholics for not being anti semitic enough? I don't know what evidence on any topic he could, like on what fast food is better if he presented evidence, I'd be like, I can't trust you because you're too anti semitic for just fucking a McDouble.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:10:19.000
    | text      = Yeah. And I guess I'm not an expert enough on these issues. But I could see possibly somebody having a problem with the Second Vatican Council that wasn't rooted in feelings of anti semitism. I think that that's possible. I'm not sure exactly. I don't know enough about Catholicism to know where that would come from. But I'm willing to believe that Yeah. However, without and Gibson, I am not considering his numerous thoughts about how the Holocaust didn't happen, right. I'm gonna go ahead and say, you don't get a pass. You don't get you don't get the charity of like, Oh, it's just some kind of a doctrinal difference or something. No, no, no,

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:10:58.000
    | text      = no, no, that's that is the nice thing about Catholicism, right? Is that if it even if it's not anti semitic, you can find an absurd small thing to argue about and willing to die for because it's, it's the Bible. You know, like, Hey, what are you talking about? Beaver is a fish on Fridays. I'm telling you this right now because I want to eat it and I'm the Pope. You want to use a beaver that said, Okay, a beaver is technically a fish. Facism because the pope wanted you to Beaver one time. He was like, Well, I can't eat it. I guess it's a fish now. Oh, yeah. So that's how it works. All right. I'm down. They do what they do.

And let's just say this, you're going to want to watch Mel Gibson on Diane Sawyer's primetime ABC tonight at 10 o'clock Eastern nine o'clock Central. We're not going to steal Mel Gibson's thunder. I mean, Hutton told me about what Mel said in the interview, but we're not going to steal his thunder here on the show and tell you what he said. In fact, they interviewed Mel for over three and a half hours, Hutton said it's only a 30 minute piece. And you take the ads out, it's probably even shorter than that. But if they don't include what Mel said, and I mean, this is bombshell stuff in this Diane Sawyer CFR piece. Believe me, you're gonna hear about it on the show tomorrow. Because we're not gonna let them get away with a normal activities. Diane Sawyer, of course, is pure New World Order. One of the biggest gun grabbers in Washington. She's a member of the council and no telling what they'll do with this piece tonight. I'm gonna be up late, up late working on a new film. So I'm going to tape it and watch it when I get home after midnight tonight. So if they handed out some key stuff, Mel was saying in this interview, will I tell you about it tomorrow?

Well, we're not trying to disarm cuboid of his bow and arrow but provide another meaningful opportunity for individuals to show their affection for their families by making their home safe as Valentine's Day said, church pastor Bruce Buchanan. The church has sponsored Gun buybacks before But Pastor Buchanan said he has moved the program to Valentine today because most of the people who turned in guns had families, and they did not want the guns in the homes. The church is aiming to buy back 150 guns, and to tell us how this went is a pastor British Buchanan.

One of the major outreaches and things he developed it started before he was there at the First Presbyterian Church.

And the verse that he's talking about it specifically is Luke 2236, which says, quote, he said to them, but now let the one who has a money bag take it and likewise a knapsack and let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. It seems like this is Jesus telling the apostles to get armed because it's about time to fight. But the full context of this is actually a little bit different. It's important to read the next two verses when you're reading.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 00:21:46.000
    | text      = Luke 22, goes on quote, It is written, and he was numbered with the transgressors. And I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment. The disciples said to see, Lord here are two swords. That's enough you replied to swords was enough, not because the swords were for fighting or self defense. It was enough because the fact that they were armed was enough to make the law consider them transgressors. In their being seen as transgressors, Jesus was fulfilling the prophecy that he would be numbered among the transgressors, which was from Isaiah chapter 52, verse 12, quote, therefore, I will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with the strong because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors, he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. The reason this pastor doesn't recognize the verse that Alex is talking about is because this is not the most important verse in the general understanding of the Bible. It's an interesting wrinkle, where Jesus was making plans to play the role that he's supposed to play in his arrest and subsequent crucifixion. But it isn't a focus in and of itself. For Alex, on the other hand, it's paramount, he completely miss interprets the verse because he needs something in the Bible to give divine justification for his obsession with guns. So this verse is probably the single most important verse in the Bible to someone like him. Yeah. And so for him, it's like, you don't know the most important verse.

Yeah, sure, I suppose in the 1980s, and ultra conservative Catholic named Gary goofier decided to use the color confusion in the 1958 enclave to push a conspiracy theory that said that there was a pope, who was decided when that first white smoke was seen, and it was this conservative Cardinal named Giuseppe Siri. Siri was allegedly voted in as Pope but then he was threatened by Jews and Freemasons not taking the position. So the Enclave continued on voting. The 1958 enclave elected Pope John the 23rd. But he would only live for a few more years after that dying in 1963. The subsequent enclave in 1963 elected Giovanni Montini, who took on the name Paul the sixth, but according to the conspiracy theory, again, it was supposed to be Cardinals theory, but the Jews and Freemasons made a bunch of threats Sure, which stopped his election again, you're gonna do all this is nonsense, and there's no proof of any of it and Syria himself has never gone on record about it and seems to show literally no indication towards supporting this theory. However, in the 1958 enclave, John the 23rd was elected and he was the pope who called Hold for the Second Vatican Council, which strongly condemned anti semitism. So this conspiracy theory gives the appearance of some kind of greater storyline behind the opposition to the post Council church that doesn't rely just on saying you want to deny the Holocaust, right? That's what Newton is espouse on Yeah, it's an elaborate theory he promotes because the church he wants to belong to doesn't support him denying the Holocaust and believing in ridiculous anti semitic conspiracies, which seems to be more important, right. And he's not willing to give that up.
