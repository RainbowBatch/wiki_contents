Today, Dan needs to take a break from explaining Alex Jones to Jordan, so instead he tells Jordan all about a story from the annals of Project Camelot.

In this installment, the gents explore JoAnne and Mark Richards, a married couple who claim to be deeply involved in the Secret Space Program. Are they really space travelers, or is Mark a very serious con-man who has a lot of fanciful stories about Space Raptors? Most likely that second option.
