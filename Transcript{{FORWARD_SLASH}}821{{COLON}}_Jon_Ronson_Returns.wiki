Because you have just released a new podcast slash audio book called The debutante? And before we get into it, very, very deep because I've got notes and notes. Could you just give a rundown of like the the general conspiracy, that theory that led you to make this

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jon Ronson
    | timestamp = 00:03:40.000
    | text      = right Okay, so that's a conspiracy theory that doesn't really come from the right, it comes very much from the mainstream world at all, like NBC and so on. I'd also like academics on the left. So it's an unusual conspiracy theory in that regard. And the theory is that Timothy McVeigh, who obviously blew up the Oklahoma, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, in 1995, History says that he was essentially a lone wolf, he, he coerced two old army friends into helping him but essentially, he was a lone wolf. And the theory is that he wasn't a lone wolf. Or in fact, he had help from a mysterious and very odd white supremacy compound in the Ozark Mountains called Elohim. City, and particularly to men their man called Andy the German at a man called Dennis Mohan and the reason why the world knows this is because at Elohiym city was a very unlikely unexpected undercover informant who was a former debutante and high society, young woman named Carol Howell who became a white supremacy spokeswoman before turning and became immune to cover informants out if the world's only listened to her information. Then the Oklahoma City bombings It never have happened.

All of my stories take, you know, months or years. And then somebody says, you know, what's it about? The first time you try to explain that to somebody just say, whatever it is, yeah, you sounds terrible. But yeah, cuz cuz you make the show. But then you have to figure out how to explain the show, which is a whole different thing. It's almost like so yeah, so now, okay,

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jon Ronson
    | timestamp = 00:06:00.000
    | text      = I'm ready. I've been obsessed me for what it obsessed me back in the 90s when I first stumbled on the story. And I did a pretty lackluster documentary about it at the time, in an otherwise very good series called Secret rules of the world. It was the one episode that didn't really work. Oh, that was the same series where I snuck into growth with Alex Jones. Right? You got it? Yes. So all the other episodes were great that one wasn't, it's always sort of bugged me as you know, such an interesting story. And I got nowhere. So just before the pandemic, I decided to give it another shot. And for the last three or four years, on and off, I've been doing just that.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:06:40.000
    | text      = Amazing. So then, you start, I think, obviously, at the beginning with her childhood, but what I noticed whenever I was listening to it is that your your interviews about her childhood were sparse at best. Yeah, they stories were not very specific, and, and so on. So did you interview more people than made it onto the show? Or?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jon Ronson
    | timestamp = 00:07:05.000
    | text      = No, I think we pretty much included everyone we interviewed. I agree with her story kind of comes to life when she is a high school senior. That's where you really start to get to know who she is. And then you massively get to know who she is. A couple of years later when she Marisa first her husband, Greg, who I did a great interview with. But yes, I agree we didn't get people from her school wouldn't talk to us. So if you have learned anything.

    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:07:38.000
    | text      = All right. All right. Fall on. Full disclosure. We were talking before the before we started recording. I've done a significant amount of research for this interview. And on the SPL Zone website, SPLC Zone website is her or at least what was her assumed name in I think 2015 or whenever it was published. It is Amanda, Bryn Collins, and Brynn. Collins is specifically the writer of the toxic parents survivor guide. So as far as her childhood is concerned, I will I will tell you that I assume you weren't able to talk to her parents. I know her mom's dead. Yeah,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jon Ronson
    | timestamp = 00:08:24.000
    | text      = she suddenly died. I the reason why I didn't approach her father was because we were holding out for an interview with her. And so we thought, well, I can't you know, it seemed right etiquette wise to not approach her father before we got a yes or no from her. And right up until the end, it was a possibility that we would interview her. I want to caveat that by saying that, you know, it's a pain in the ass. And it's unusual, I think for me that I don't get to interview absolutely everyone involved in the story. So this is unusual that I didn't get to talk to her. But I got to talk to so many like extraordinary people involved in the story, including her first husband that is still like a very rich, listen. Yeah.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:09:05.000
    | text      = Well, that's the that's the central thing about the story that I find so fascinating, is that everybody was lying to you pretty much all the time. almost constantly, like your your interviews with Greg with Rachel Patterson are non stop lies. It's so fascinating to me.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jon Ronson
    | timestamp = 00:09:26.000
    | text      = Okay, so I'd want you to tell me everything that you know,

    | timestamp = 00:09:30.000
    | text      = Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, let's just let's just start with her childhood. So you you interviewed one of her childhood friends who was also adopted, and she recalled her from high school, right? Yes.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jon Ronson
    | timestamp = 00:09:40.000
    | text      = He she passionately wanted to talk to us because she felt that you know, she remembered the nice Carol before it all. Everything told her terrific. And because of her good memories. She felt kind of, you know, morally compelled to talk to us. Yeah, So that's why she spoke to
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:10:00.000
    | text      = us. Right? And then the next interview is chronologically is with Greg, her first husband, whom she married on a whim on a on a day or practically. So the story there, Could you could you give that kind of clearer for me the picture of how that happened? Because as far as I understand it, it was they were drunk one night, etc.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jon Ronson
    | timestamp = 00:10:22.000
    | text      = Yes. Okay. So here's the story that Greg told. And I should say everything that Greg told me we much later got ahold of the FBI report that got a forgotten his name. But anyway, the guy who was investigating Carol, when she rejoined, blah, blah, blah, okay. And, and in this report was a contemporaneous interview that he did with Greg, back then Greg's only ever given two interviews once we went to the FBI, and what I will tell you, and the reason why I can't just did Greg, so I'm interested to hear what you got to say. Is that the story he told me the story told the FBI at the time really tally with each other. For instance, we'll get to there how she broke her feet. Oh, of course, of course. I don't want to jump back and forth.

Tulsa is in was one of the most racist and awful places on this fucking planet. Oh, yeah. And it wasn't in spite of people like Carol's dad. It is because of people like Carol's dad. So whenever there's that question of where she became racist, and all of those things, I can tell you that she grew up rich, white, in Tulsa in Reagan's America. Yes, she was born racist.

    | text      = Okay. Sure, like, sure. But let me give you a bit of sort of counter suggestions here. So her friend Laurie swore that she wasn't racist in high school. And she became, she came back racist from Colorado. So so what we said the story that we tell in the show is that if she joined, we were told by a by a source that she had joined the Temple of psychic youth. And the thing about the Temple of psychic youth is that just like, you know, a lot of bands back then, but I think psychic TV were more hardcore. They were like playing with Nazi imagery and sort of rituals and fascism. And as the guy from the temple of psychic youth said to us, you know, when, when you play act being a Nazi long enough, maybe you actually become one show. So from speaking to her high school friend, from speaking to the guy from the temple of psychic youth, and then obviously speaking to Greg, when she gets back from Colorado for the Temple of psychic youth, the narrative that I put together just based on what I could pick up. Oh, no, of course, yeah. Was that in high school, she didn't display any racism in Colorado, she joined this group with think, which had all these connotations. And then she came back from Colorado as being racist. And the other thing I'd say is, when I met the head of her debutante committee, now lives in a retirement home on the edge of Tulsa, I thought very much well, you know, I think people generally think that if you're the head of a Tulsa debutante committee, you're gonna be some, you know, right wing, you know, etc, etc. And she wasn't even her name's Dixie. rappy. She wasn't she was she was a Democrat, and she got into being the head of the debutante committee because she was like, into theater and she liked the dresses. And so basically, so what I'm saying is like, if there's things that is part of the story that frustrate you know, that do frustrate you, it's because you know, I'm just going by what bits of information that I pick up, but I'm totally used together.

    | text      = Well, that's what I that's again, that's the thing that I am I'm really, really interested in is because that is a context that is absolutely there, whether or not the interview subjects who have a vested interest in not being On a national Jon Ronson story, revealing that they were gigantic racist 30 years ago, I will just say this. Yeah, regardless of whether or not she expressed or showed that racist behavior, if you were a debutante growing up in Tulsa high society, only what, four or five years after segregation in schools, quote, unquote, ended. Wow. Later, okay. Yes, Tulsa is one of the worst places, racism, it's still segregated, in most ways. And so regardless of what they might say, she was told, probably by her teachers in school, in Reagan's America at that time, that black men were crack addled rapists. And that's what she would have been raised thinking. And so that's why whenever we're talking about the story, you know, your origin moment for her and we're gonna, we're about to get right into it, because this is where we kind of transition right into that her origin moment, you know, is is given with this idea that this story comes from her being in Colorado, and then learning the lingo of the far right Nazi world. And then bringing it back. And I will say that in Tulsa society Oh, of black men are predators was an regardless of political party, you can be a Democrat in the late 80s.

But I don't pick apart the story I'm about to tell because I didn't know what make of it so I say this in the show I did want to make this so if you've got something I would love to hear it. So the story is that Snell you know, kills a black state trooper, a pawn shop owner. He's on death row. The date of his execution is set for April the 19th 1995, which is the same day, the two year anniversary of Ruby Ridge. No, so the two year anniversary of Waco and the day, the Timothy McVeigh is going to blow up the mode Building in Oklahoma City. So as he's waiting to be executed, he asks the prison guard if he could turn the TV on, so they turn on the TV, and Robert Mueller Fabella him city who's his spiritual adviser and Snell a sitting on death row watching this footage of things blowing up and out of the building blowing up? And Snell is like the prison guards notes in his logbook. That style is like nodding and smiling. Yeah. And of course, you could you know, if you believe the conspiracy theory, then what you're what you believe, is it Timothy McVeigh is one of the reasons why he blew up the building on that day was in protest of snows execution. Yeah,

Or it's a weird, fucked up thing that the justice system did to execute Snell on the same day as Waco. That's wild, that those two things happened at the same time. But what I find fascinating about that, is that that suggests that they did know that it was going to happen, and caroled didn't. Do you understand what I mean? It doesn't matter if Carol's because Carol never said shit in her diary in any of the things that Carol doesn't say shit about him. But they did. No. Do you understand? That is very clear to me.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:47:12.000
    | text      = Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That. Because Because here's the thing, what I find so interesting about this is the idea that I feel like people in this had been really close to the idea that Carol has anything to do with anything. And that leads them to think that there was an individual person that had anything to do with anything to help with McVeigh. But what the reality is, based on the fact that we've spent, you know, our lives now, in listening to people like this talk in listening to people of this order, is that it's just talking shit. Everywhere, Timothy McVeigh went, he was a gun store. He was a gun show guy, right? So he traveled all around the country, especially the American, southeast, and southwest, right? He goes around to all of these gun shows, everybody's talking about The Turner Diaries. Everybody knows who Snell is. Everybody knows all of these people. They're all in the network. And so Timothy McVeigh didn't need individual help from people. They gave him the target through a million different conversations. Oh, yeah. And it's not it's a social movement, and McVeigh was the person who executed it. So you mind? Yeah.

They're in a network, all of these people. So whoever's in Elohiym city is listening to Robert malarkey talk and then they go to a gun show and and the stress fires there and they're just talking shit. And all of them are talking shit. They're all talking shit. Because they're like, dude, dude, energy and like trying to outdo each other with how revolutionary and cool they are trying to outdo each other with their racism, all of this stuff, just like they did at what was it the forest reserve standoff with the Bundys.

All right, he went to the Gulf War, notorious for being one of the most one sided, asymmetric wars as far as like technology and shit go, right comes back. He's disappointed, depressed and pissed off, Waco happens. And he watches the same asymmetric warfare happen where a tank is brought to somebody's house, you know, and then he says, there's no consequences for this. No one's doing anything about it. So I'm going to give you consequences. And the reason that the conspiracy theory to me the reason that it's so attractive is because in the conspiracy theory, a heroic act can stop a bombing. And in the reality, it is the sins of our country coming home to fuck us, you know? So that's my, that's my take on on this this story.

Yeah, you see echoes of that encounter story.

Carol tells everyone what they want to hear. And Carol gets whatever she wants based from these relationships on. McVeigh is the complete opposite. All he does is tell the truth, he doesn't get close to anybody. He keeps going from place to place like a drifter.

But I will say that her her pattern of behavior what I would strongly suspect of her childhood and and everything that she's done in your story, leads you to that point. And I think part of the reason that people look over it is appearance. She's a woman. There's so much misogyny baked into this tale.

She's like a sort of femme fatale for like, everyone for, for for, for the white supremacy guys that she was dating, but also for conspiracy investigators and for victims of the bombing, you know, who want answers and closure? She, as you said, she tells people what they want to hear? Oh, yeah, all the time. And one of the legacies of that is she's also now become a very kind of totemic figure, if that's the right phrase for people. And this is where it gets into slightly more complicated areas. Yeah, no, I'm down. Right. Okay. So for people, as you know, there's a, there's a big move in some sort of academic quarters on the left to say that, that the anti governments right in America are much more white supremacist than we think, and much more unified and collect and connected than we think, as big. And so we have to, you know, they're plotting against us, they're plotting Civil War. So we have to like raid, you know, we have to proactively do stuff about it. Like for instance, writing, Callaghan's essay. So, and cow fits very neatly into that narrative, because if you believe Carol's story, then what you're also believing is that McVeigh had much more specific help from other Nazis, which proves that they're much more unified than they would like us to believe. Right? Yeah. But as you say, and I say, I just I think cow story crumbles when you dig into it. To believe that kind of means that you're believing in a conspiracy theory as far as far as

I don't think you would have been able to stop somebody from bombing the Murrah Building. But if you wanted to stop Timothy McVeigh from bombing the Murrah Building, then after Waco, you disband the ATF and hold the leadership accountable for it, no amount of rating anyone of any kind of force applied by the law is going to stop, it's only going to increase the likelihood of another OKC bombing.

Unfortunately, very apt, Louis Brandeis quotes, the Ark government is the potent the omnipresent teacher, that quote, and it is very much like if you want to, if you want to get to the heart of of where these things are coming from, you have to point at the people with agency. And that is the people in the FBI and the ATF and the government. The law enforcement, like a cab is not specific to cops. It's it's ATF, it's FBI, it's the Border Patrol, all of these people are creating the violence that they pretend to stop. And I think if we didn't have movies, if it weren't so attractive to have an FBI agent and a movie, and we knew what the FBI and ATF and all those people actually do, we would be like, no, no, no, we got to get rid of these assholes as soon as fucking possible.

And so, so we had a conversation about it. And one thing that, you know, I sort of ruefully pointed out is that, you know, Joe Rogan, broad, you know, does about three hours of audio a day, I do about three hours of audio a year. So a that means a lot less wealthy than he is. Pay, it means that you know, I have a massive amount of time to go home and think about every single thing that I say in the show. Sure. So actually, you know, every split second of my shows or books, whatever they are, have been like thought over, molded over, like a million times. I need I guess the problem with doing three hours of broadcast today. So you don't do that. You just splurge it all out. And that becomes the thing.

Because everybody in that world talk shit nonstop. They knew that this guy Timothy McVeigh was talking shit about doing it on this day. So when they turned the TV on, they had no idea if anything was actually going to happen. And in fact, I would bet $99 million on them thinking, I bet this guy's full of shit, and nothing is going to happen. And then it did. Right. That is, to me the only reasonable explanation that that handles things that make sense of all of the disparate informed facts that we that actually exist.

And and for for their faults, Timothy McVeigh is a believer. And so it is the shit talk universe that catches hold of a believer and then the believer does shit. You know? So to me, whenever people talk about how do you want to stop and okay, see, I don't care about the shit talkers. The shit talkers are everywhere. I mean, the thing about that strip club tape, right?

Yeah. Um, she says that she didn't actually identify McVeigh or stress my or anyone. I think you said there's nobody in the story that you believe. I agree with you that it feels that McVeigh is telling the truth, but also the FBI agents who arrested Carol, I think he was telling me the truth. And in fact, when I read his report, finally that, you know, he wrote this sort of six or seven page report, where he interviews Carlos, first husband, Greg, and it's funny, I read support right at the end of the process, like he gave it to me, but I didn't read it until I was, you know, almost finished with the show. And what really surprised me and made me sort of smile, roughly, because I'd spent like, so much time trying to figure out what to make of the story. And his report is pretty much identical to how I ended up, I ended up telling my story. And and so I think the journey that he went on at the time in the 90s, to try and figure out Carol and Greg, they had an elephant city, he seems to have come to pretty much exactly the same conclusions that I came to 30. Yeah, yeah. So I think he's somebody so there is one person to believe in.

Most of the people on the ground are giving accurate information, giving good advice, and it is the leadership of like Louis free and those fun squads, who are saying that we want to try out our new toys. And when they didn't receive any, they didn't even receive a reprimand. Everybody was like, Yeah, of course, we murdered those people at Waco. They were evil. You know, that was the point that was the point where it is like, if we do not hold ourselves accountable, then somebody who we sent to a fucking war and taught how to kill people is going to, you know, like, that is that is the fucking crux of the Waco OKC connection.
