An incident between two groups of students at Live Oak high school at a school sponsored Cinco Demayo event, a Mexican American student walked around campus with a flag of Mexico and other students flew a makeshift American States flag or United States flag in response and chanted at the flag bearing students. Students on both sides complained about the incident. A year later, several students came to school on Cinco Demayo wearing American flag shirts and school officials told the students to remove the American flag shirts, or turn the shirts inside out. The educator said the American flag shirts could send a message that would offend the Cinco Demayo celebrants and they had public safety concerns. So what ended up happening was there was essentially standoffs between Cinco Demayo, celebrants and kids aggressively wearing American flag apparel at them on Cinco Demayo.
