    | text      = I'm really glad to hear that. Why did they do it? Because it's been an issue for me. I've never understood Me neither. So Jordan today we have an episode to go. I do. I do believe we do. Yes. I was thinking about it. And I. So on our last episode, I ended by saying we're going back to the past. Yes. And that was something that I was going to do. But I also felt a little bit of a draw towards doing something a little bit different, right? Novelty? Well, kind of. So the for a long time, people have wanted us to branch out to cover other things. And there aren't a whole lot of other things that really fit within the category of, you know, stuff that that we can cover in a way that I think is in our in our wheelhouse. Right, right, right. You know, there are folks like Tim Poole who are kind of an option, sort of, but he's also like a shithead cloud chasing trollee asshole and right don't really care to engage with a lot of stuff like that. Right? Not to say that he's not somebody who shouldn't be, you know, monitored attention to share. It's just maybe that's not what I find my abilities right suited for. Right. Alright, Project Camelot is kind of a bummer. Lately, Jim Baker is a disaster gone. There's people like Russell Brand, but I don't know, maybe maybe we'll do an episode about him at some point. But in terms of like a regular source of something to look at. Right. I'm not sure that that's our, our lane.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 00:08:08.000
    | text      = I feel like we come into an issue where finally we in our audience are at odds here, right? Okay. So when we do episodes about other people, our audience enjoys them. And the reason being is because we are making an enjoyable episode out of it. Right? We do not enjoy it because it is not enjoyable. Well, so there's a little bit of a push back there. There's a disclosure.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:08:32.000
    | text      = I'm not sure. I think that that whether it's enjoyable for us is kind of really down the line of of priorities because I've been so enjoyable. Is it ever to really even talk about Alex John at all? We've gotten used to it. That other people, maybe we're not used to hearing? Yeah. But I think that there is a certain type of figure that we are well equipped to discuss, right? And then there's figures that maybe our skill sets aren't designed towards, you know, someone like Tim Poole. I feel like you could end up in a situation where you want to scream at him on Twitter, like you did with Glenn Greenwald. And that plays into like his whole thing. Sure. She does. He's kind of trying to make people angry. Yeah. Baiting. And yeah, there's there's a intentional strategy of like, boosting engagement that comes along with that. It's really transparent. Totally. He's doing Yeah. So anyway, this is a long way of saying I decided that now that Tucker is away from Fox News. I thought maybe we should try. We should give it a test balloon and see if we can apply our skills and our our shit to his Twitter show.

    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:10:18.000
    | text      = Yeah, yeah. Well, I will say this all right here, I think is why I'm more willing to jump into that now than otherwise. Tucker doesn't have a boss anymore. That's what's important to me. Like, the more I think about the the like thread that keeps people interesting. It's not having a boss. It's not having a boss.

Because of, it's gonna be awful for you. And then also, just like, I don't know exactly if it works for us. I just had some kind of like, I'm not sure. And that's part of the reason why you want to try a test balloon. Here we go. It is. Let's see what we do. But yeah, you said, No, I think we should like, well, all right, here yourself

So it might be a little bit shorter of an episode than some of our other ones because his episodes are only like, 10 minutes long. What are so on Twitter? Yeah. Okay. It's just basically like, what would have been his opening monologue? Yeah, or whatever. Fascinating. And so I was gonna do the first two episodes, because those are the ones that are out now at the time of recording. But I figured, you know, we'll, we'll try out the first one. If it works.

The rushing wall of water wiped out entire villages destroyed a critical hydropower plant. And as of tonight puts the largest nuclear reactor in Europe in danger of melting down. So if this was intentional, it was not a military tactic. It was an act of terrorism. The question is who did it? Well, let's see, the Coast Guard dam was effectively Russian. It was built by the Russian government. It currently sits sorry. The dams reservoir supplies water to Crimea, which has been for the last 240 years home of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Blowing up the dam may be bad for Ukraine, but it hurts Russia more. And for precisely that reason the Ukrainian government has considered destroying it. In December, The Washington Post quoted Ukrainian general saying his men had fired American made rockets at the dams flood gate as a test striker. So really, once the facts start coming in, it becomes much less of a mystery what might have happened to the dam, any fair person would conclude that the Ukrainians probably blew it up.

    | text      = So let's start here with that, that Washington Post article that he's talking about. That is a real article, but Tucker is wildly mischaracterizing what it says. The article itself is discussion of Ukrainian counter offensives against Russian occupied areas, largely focusing on the successful push to liberate Israel. After that operation concluded in the northeast of the country, Ukrainian generals were interested in attempting similar tactics in the south to drive Russia out of Curzon. Essentially, the story is about a fakeout tactic that allowed Ukrainian forces to make it appear that they were heading for Islam, when they were actually approaching from the north, which led to a mass retreat by Russian troops, and a victory for Ukraine, the hope was to be able to create another situation near Kherson, where Russian troops would be isolated and forced to surrender or retreat. The area around the city of Kherson is mainland Ukraine, bordered to the east by the Dnieper River, on the other side of that river is more of the curse on Oh, blast and ways further south, you end up in the Crimean peninsula, from the opposite side of the river from Kurdistan, to the landbridge to Crimea, it's still over 100 kilometers. But this land is also at this point under Russian occupation. Right, right for the last year.

    | text      = So the goal of this operation that Ukraine was engaged in that this Washington Post was talking about was to cut off the city of Kherson from the area to the western side of the river, that that's where curse on the city is you're trying to isolate that from Russian occupied areas so that the Russians couldn't restock supplies to the forces they're sure from that article, quote, the 25,000 Russian troops and that poor portion of curse on separated by the bra I'd river from their supplies had been placed in a highly exposed position. If enough military pressure was applied, Moscow would have no choice but to retreat, co valchek said Russia had to arm and feed its forces via via three crossings the Antonov ski bridge, the Antonov ski railway bridge and the Nova Kopka dam, part of a hydroelectric hydro electric facility with a road running on top of it. The two bridges were targeted with us supplied M 142, High Mobility Artillery Rocket, our rocket systems, or high Mars launchers, which have a range of 50 miles and were quickly rendered impassable. There were moments when we turned off their supply lines completely and they were still, they still managed to build crossings, Kovalchuk said they managed to replenish ammunition. It was very difficult, because I'll check considered flooding the river. The Ukrainians he said even conducted a test strike with high Mars launchers on one of the flood gates at the Novikova Kosovska dam, making three holes in the metal to see if the neighbor water would be raised high enough to stymie Russian crossings, but not flood nearby villages. The test was a success Kovalchuk said but the step remained a last resort he held off right. So that is the thing in that article that Tucker is referring to right, gotcha. One variable that's important to recognize here is that the Ukrainian forces were able to force a retreat from the city of Kherson. But that wasn't all that happened. From that same Washington Post article, quote, the pressure from Ukrainian troops forced to retreat, but they didn't manage to run down or destroy the fleeing Russians. mines in some case laid a meter apart or, and three rows deep or tucked in thin strips of road prevented the Ukrainians from giving chase. There are a lot of possibilities for what happened with that dam. And it's not a foregone conclusion. The way Tucker is saying it is. It's possible that Ukrainian forces blew it up. But it doesn't really serve a meaningful strategic purpose for them right now, when flooding the dam was considered an option late last year, it was in the context of a larger objective, which was ultimately achieved. So using this article to justify present day actions doesn't really make sense. It's also possible that Russia blew it up for any number of reasons, or it's not impossible, that it collapsed due to completely unintentional causes. It could have been one of the minds that was left behind or a freak accident. There are a lot of possibilities. But when you're Tucker and you're presenting the situation through an extremely Russia promoting lens, then it makes sense to say that any fair person would conclude that the Ukrainians blew it up.

But Tucker doesn't turn on the camera and just go live. He does some preparation. And the fingerprints of that preparation are really transparent when you pay attention.

Except the Tucker fails to mention that the dam was built in the 1950s when Ukraine was part of the USSR, and that the territory that the dam is in can only be called Russian territory because the Russian army is occupying it. It's been an illegally occupied area since the invasion began in 2022. Tucker is trying to play that game that other Russia apologists do where they argue that areas like Crimea or the Donbass are actually really Russia, evoking the idea that the invasion is just Russia taking back what's actually already theirs. That's not accurate about those areas, and it's even less true of Kherson. But if you're listening to the way that Tucker speaks, his words contain conclusions that he hasn't earned. Yeah, yeah.

That sounds good. Tucker isn't given the full picture here. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, and at that point, they needed the water that came from the naper River and the Kafka reservoir. It wasn't as much of an issue for drinking water. But the North Crimean Canal, which is fed from that reservoir is responsible for a vast majority of the irrigation systems in the area. After the annexation, Ukraine began requiring payments from Russia for the delivery of water, which Russia did not go along with, due to their refusal to pay Ukraine created another dam that would block the flow of water to the north Crimean Channel. In the present invasion, Russian troops seized the area, and they blew up that dam reopening the canal for the delivery of water, which in turn lowered the level of the reservoir considerably, and caused some concerns about issues that Tucker is even bringing up now. Like, the danger to the the nuclear power plant.

He then transitions into the Washington Post article that we discussed as the justification for the basis of that claim. But that article doesn't support Tucker's position. That article is not about Ukraine, considering destroying the dam because it would hurt Russia more than them. It has an element in it of Ukraine considering destroying part of the dam, and Tucker is writing his own story about why and using that for his own purposes. It's pretty similar behavior that you see with Alex. Yeah, you know, basically what you're doing is abusing a primary source. Aleksey usually uses rewritten headlines. Yeah.

Last month, a bunch of classified documents were leaked on Discord, including one that indicated that the CIA was aware that Ukraine had plans to blow up the pipeline approximately three months before that attack took place. Okay. It's entirely possible that this plan was what came to fruition, but it's also possible that it's not Yeah. The person who leaked that information was a 21 year old man named Jack to shara, who is now been arrested for the leak. Well, you shouldn't necessarily throw out a message because it comes from a shitty messenger. It's probably important to be aware that Jack was described by a friend as a proud racist who was preoccupied with the idea of a common race war. He was a bigot who talked about how the government was a Zionist occupied government. And he liked to hang out with like minded young people. So he started a Discord server called thug shaker Central. Jack worked in computer science for the government and through that he had access to this classified material which he then posted on his racist Discord server. Also, in that server, he would laugh while watching ISIS execution videos and express his support about the Christchurch massacre. I'm bringing this up because Jack to share is clearly a piece of shit. But that does not necessarily mean that the document that he's leaked is fake. What it does mean is that I'm not willing to trust this racist right wing extremist judgment when it comes to leaking documents that capture the full picture of the available intelligence. Someone like this is clearly intensely ideologically motivated. And that makes it very difficult to take on blind faith that there isn't another document that casts doubt on Ukrainian responsibility for the pipeline attack that he ignored or didn't release.

As with Alex, who would not be surprised to find him being an adherent of the belief that Putin carried out the apartment bombings back at that point in time before Tucker became excessively pro Putin. Right. It's really interesting to see Tucker denigrating the cable news watcher here too. In that clip. He's on his first day of his career not being a cable news hack, and all of a sudden, he's so above the riffraff. It feels like an adolescent who's found a new friend group and he's pretending he was never a dork. I get the motivation here, but it's kind of sad. Like Tucker didn't decide to strike out on his own when he had another choice. He's doing this show because he got fired from a cable news hack position where he made millions for years. It's not like oh, oh, the cable news. Media wants you the cable news if you were to believe that Putin wants to annoy you, girl up.

It was sold to the public largely on the rationale that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, because he had WMDs and harbored terrorist, we could not just wait and see how things went, we needed to take action. Tucker sold the war on CNN, Tucker argued day in day out that he didn't support war, but that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and we needed to begrudgingly invade. He can try to play this roguish character that's so different from the Republican establishment, but his career was built on being complicit in their greatest blunders. Also, on a number of occasions, Tucker came right up to the line of saying that Iraq was directly involved at 911. For instance, on the September 25 2002 episode of Crossfire, he said this, quote, more hints today that there's some kind of a link between Iraq and al Qaeda. At a NATO conference in Poland, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters that Washington has evidence linking Iraq to al Qaeda, he says he presented the evidence to other NATO defense ministers. So far, however, most Democrats are dismissive of the evidence, presumably, because Democratic campaign hacks believe they have better access to classified intelligence information than the Secretary of Defense.

But there's a fun game for Tucker, because it's a shortcut for him to present to Lenski as a bad person, so that he can say doesn't it seem like he's the sort of person who would hope that even if you buy the premise that he's a bad person, it doesn't follow that this indicates that he's willing to blow up a dam to blame somebody else

Asked about our so called allies reluctance to stand up to evil dictators. They clearly frustrated President Bush told reporters, Surely our friends have learned lessons from the past. On the other hand, maybe they haven't, as one by one its former colonies have descended into chaos and misery. Francis looked away when a war broke out of the middle of Europe during the 1990s, France yond when the United States which twice saved France from a German speaking future, attempts to disarm one of the world's most dangerous lunatics.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 01:01:22.000
    | text      = Wikipedia article about sky know what a tautology is. So in the area of logic, a tautology is a statement that must be true because it has to be, for instance, A equals A is a tautology, because the thing must be the same as itself. Another really elementary one is either a equals b or a does not equal b, because the disjunction or is satisfied if one of the elements is true, and A equals b and a does not equal b contain all possible states of being either they are the same or they are not. a tautology is essentially a structure of a statement that has no possible way of being false. When you're talking about logic tautologies aren't bad arguments. They're just a term that describes formulations of sentences that can never be false. And when we're talking about something can never be false. It's important to understand that this is using the word false in the logic sets. sentences have truth values in as much as they can be true or false based on their structure. For instance, if you have the sentence A and B, the truth value of the sentence is determined by the truth value of and for the conjunction and to be true, both A and B must be true. So if A and B are true, the sentence A and B is true. And if A is true, and B is false, then the sentence A and B is false. When you get into different types of grammar within the sentences, different rules apply for truth values. For instance, if you have the disjunction, like a or b, that sentence will be true if A is true, if B is true, or if both are true. The only way it can be false is if both are false. If you're dealing with an if then statement like if A then B that will be true in every case, except for the instance where a is true and B is false, because of the relationship of how if then, AND and OR work. Yeah, all of these sentence constructions are not tautologies because there are instances where they can be false. What Tucker is talking about is not the logic meaning of tautology, he's talking about the rhetoric version. This is a term that's thrown around to derive someone using somewhat self proving or redundant arguments that people make like what Tucker is pretending Nikki Haley said, she didn't say that you need to support Ukraine because they need your support. But Tucker claim that's what she said, most likely, because he wanted to do this little fake smart guy stick about tautology, because that sentence would be more or less a rhetorical redundancy. Yeah, the problem here runs a little bit deeper though. The statements that he mocks at the end of the clip are not tautologies in the logic sense, nor in the rhetoric sense. They are just sentiments that he doesn't like diversity is our strength is a bit slogan eat but it's not a tautology. It's not even really something you could translate into the logical form because it's just a statement. It wouldn't be an if A then B kind of thing. It would just be represented by a there's no narrative. It would just be there's no there's no grammar within it. No, it's it is just, it's just a and that can be true or false. That's it's not a tautology. It also isn't a tautology in the rhetorical sense because it's not redundant. Our strength is our strength would be a rhetorical tautology, right? trans women are women is not a tautology. Again, it's just a statement that he doesn't like. It's slightly verbally redundant in the word woman appears twice. But it's not really a rhetorical tautology because of the context of those words. The landscape isn't as Alinsky as Churchill is not even close to a tautology in either sense of the word. Tucker is using this word to describe beliefs he doesn't like and I think what he trying to say is that these are statements that he feels people throw around baselessly their statements that are just supposed to be true on their face. No evidence required. But I don't think that people who believe those three statements believe them for no reason. Tucker is acting like they do, but they don't. I could very easily explain why I believe the first two like I could, it wouldn't, it wouldn't be difficult and I'd be happy to if Tucker wants sure someone else can take the Zelinsky Churchill one. No, I'm not gonna feel that that's not my business. I'll take two of the three. It's unfortunate that whoever wrote this monologue for Tucker didn't actually study. I knew this stuff. Because it's, I mean, it's a little bit embarrassing when you try to be condescending, and you're talking about stuff wrong. Yeah. When they went back when they taught logic now,

So the American public very well may be poorly informed particularly about things that are going on other countries, but I'm not sure where it ranks internationally. What I can say, however, is that Tucker Carlson viewers are almost certainly less informed than the average American. There was a famous survey that was done about a decade back that found that Fox News viewers were the least informed about current events and politics. While Daily Show and NPR viewers were the highest. And just last year, a survey found that Fox watchers were vastly more likely to believe misinformation about climate issues than people who got news from other sources. Why do they why do they think that is? I would guess it's because their business model is not informing the audience.

The Pentagon has spent decades studying these otherworldly remains in order to build more technologically advanced weapons systems. Okay, that's what the former Intel officer revealed and it was clear he was telling the truth. In other words UFOs are actually real and apparently so is extraterrestrial life.

They thought that Americans lived in grinding poverty in a state of perpetual race war, and were desperate to flee to the freedom and prosperity of the Eastern Bloc. They thought this because that's what they had been told they had no way to know otherwise. The few Russians who understood what was really going on in the rest of the world had learned about it from listening to shortwave radio broadcasts, sometimes under the covers so the neighbors wouldn't hear. 50 years later, it is bewildering to consider the ironies here.

They're more explicit. And I think that may be a function of the fact that he has to prepare us to write these things out. Whereas Alex is just running off the cuff. Yeah, and he'll say some things that are real fucked up in whatever you write. But he's often talking a mile a minute, and by the time he said them, this is on to something else. Yeah. Whereas this is very intentional, and very much like a The this is a choice to call him rat like a presser of Christian.

I don't know if he's gonna be able to satisfy the people he wants to reach. I know that that Andrew Anglin review is was not super complimentary as a whole. Yeah. Because he was like, yeah, he's saying all this stuff. That's right about Zelinsky. And Ukraine, and then he gets into UFOs. Yeah. Fucking idiot, or whatever. Yeah. So like there is there is a desire up from that Nazi base to see him go mask off. Yeah, and probably isn't going to do that. Who knows? To what extent Elon Musk and Twitter will allow? I mean, him to push whatever envelope there is. So I don't know. I feel it seems like a temporary stop gap, or whatever, Intel he can launch something else that he can make a ton of money. Yeah.

    | timestamp = 01:37:38.000

Sure. So that is like the way you get around it. Yeah, do this while you're in your non compete to keep people aware of you to keep your audience engaged. Yeah.

This is all in conversation with itself, you know, so there's no to me there's no separation anymore. You know, like Fox News is Infowars Is this is that because they're all communicating with each other and adjusting themselves based around their equilibrium with each other?
