'''Wolfgang Halbig''' is a conspiracy theorist who is best known for promoting conspiracy theories surrounding the [[The Sandy Hook Elementary Massacre|Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], which left 26 people dead, including 20 children.

Halbig began promoting false conspiracy theories about the shooting shortly after it occurred, claiming that the event was a "false flag" operation and that the victims were "crisis actors." He has also claimed that the event was orchestrated by the government in order to push for stricter gun control laws.

Halbig's facially absurd claims have been thoroughly debunked by law enforcement officials, as well as by multiple independent fact-checkers. Despite the lack of evidence to support his claims, Halbig was able to spread them for years on [[InfoWars]]. Starting in 2013, he frequently appeared on "[[The Alex Jones Show]]," where he was given a platform to spread his conspiracy theories to a large audience.

In large part because of Halbig and Alex's disgusting behavior, the families of Sandy Hook victims have faced more than a decade of harassments and vitriol. Halbig personally harassed several families<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/politics/sandy-hook-hoaxer-arrest.html</ref>.
