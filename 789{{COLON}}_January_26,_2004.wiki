Today, Dan and Jordan reunite to break down a little day in Alex's past.  In this installment, weird complaints about Bush's 2004 State of the Union address fly freely, and Alex interviews a guy with a hard-to-spell last name and a dicey track record.

==Errata==

*Laotian heroin is a thing, with a complex and interesting history<ref>https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/heroin-trafficking-golden-triangle</ref><ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)</ref>. Northern Laos, Northern Thailand, and Eastern Myanmar are in fact collectively known as the "Golden Triangle", and are the second largest producers of heroin worldwide (after Afghanistan).
**This has in fact entered public culture -- for instance, in the movie Tropic Thunder<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD7QaHe-udo</ref>.
**The lawsuit the caller mentions remains nonsense for other reasons.
