Robert David Steele was an former CIA officer, frequent guest on InfoWars, and huge anti-Semite.

Steele died from [[Covid-19]] in August of 2021, after spreading a variety of noxious conspiracies about the disease and vaccination efforts<ref>https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yjzp/qanon-anti-vaxxer-called-covid-a-hoax-even-as-his-lungs-stopped-functioning</ref>. In his last years, Steele was a prolific Q-Anon promoter and Covid denialist. He was also involved in the [[Stop the Steal]] movement.

In the Knowledge Fight lore, Steele is perhaps most notable because he indirectly introduced [[Project Camelot]] to the Knowledge Fight canon. In 2017, Steele went on InfoWars and claimed that the government was running child slave colonies on Mars<ref>https://www.thedailybeast.com/nasa-denies-that-its-running-a-child-slave-colony-on-mars</ref>. This is obviously untrue, but lead to Dan checking in on Steele's appearances on [[Project Camelot]].

Steele was a horrific anti-Semite and holocaust denier, directly citing [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] in his personal blog. He also falsely claiming the Jewish people were responsible for the assination of JFK and [[9/11]].
