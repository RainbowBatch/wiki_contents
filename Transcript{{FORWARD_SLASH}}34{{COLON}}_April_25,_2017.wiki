I am sorry that someone says these things. It's going to be very bad. Jesus, I have cut out some stuff. It's particularly gross, because he makes a lot of Breitbart based claims about crimes that immigrants have committed. Right and I've done some digging into them and they're all not true, of course.

Whether it was the report of the refugee, teenagers, and kids reportedly raping a little girl and the media said it was all a hoax. Muslims never raped anybody. They never bomb anybody that ever shoot anybody. And the lapdog media was just salivating trying to cover it up. We weren't even the generators of that article. We weren't even leading the coverage. It should have been. And of course, they just pled guilty. Who they all pled guilty to the assault. And so through the transmutation or the alchemy of MSM, you'll file a lawsuit on Alex Jones.

The only thing he's rapping, he keeps showing either Infowars, or Breitbart articles, well as his examples of like, this is the story. This is the story, blah, blah, blah. So he's talking about the, the Chobani plant is in Twin Falls, Idaho. Ah, and in that town, there was a story that came out in June of last year, about three kids who had attacked a young girl in a laundry room. That's awful. It is awful, but it was more awful was all the lies that got spread on right wing media. They know what they said that they raped this young girl at knifepoint, and that they had videotaped it and shown their dad and he congratulated them. It was all sorts of wild whitelisting as well. It's all just trying to turn Islamic culture into something that's so foreign and evil to our minds. Of course, the dead, encourage them for this behavior,

But it's not nearly what Alex says it is. Right? And he's basing a lot of his quote, unquote, reporting on these lies that came out on Breitbart. Now, there's an article here in the Idaho statesman, which is the paper of record in Idaho, and they, they have an entire story about the plea bargains that these kids ended up having to take. Right. Which good I mean, if they should have maybe been punished harder, but the oldest was 14 at the time. So they're also minors. All right. The other thing that we have to take into consideration is that the full details of the case are under wraps. They're specific identities are under wraps, because they're all minors. Yeah, in this case, it's you can't publish the details about these people. But that's probably a good idea. The prosecutors and the defense attorneys have discussed the situation that actually happened and what happened was that there was a 1410 and seven year old boy, who basically one of them I believe the seven year old, groped a five year old girl in a laundry room.

So a cool, also the tuberculosis rates have been steadily declining all over the United States, if you like, if you include just US born people, there's a much sharper slope downward. If you include just immigrant populations, it's still trending downwards, but it's, it's still it's going down. It's a little slower, but it's still going down. Also, I pulled up the statistics as it relates to the specific cities, or sorry, states in the country, and their tuberculosis rates.

He'll get to this later, but he claims that seven active tuberculosis cases were sent to Idaho and did a little digging into that and that is actually true. But here is a response from channel 11. in Twin Falls, Idaho. You might have seen an article published today by breitbart.com, stating that seven refugees with active tuberculosis were sent to Idaho. The article said that seven refugees with active TB were diagnosed after their resettlement in Idaho between 2011 and 2015. Seven people in four years. Interesting. The state epidemiologist confirmed that that is true. However, it's not the complete story. TB is nothing new for Idaho. According to Dr. Christy Hahn, the state's epidemiologist and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare treats people both refugee and American every year. These particular cases are not contagious and do not pose a threat to the public. The department typically tests and treats refugees, the 90 days of them being in state, and the refugees are usually good patients. Quote from this Dr. Christine Han, we're very active. And the refugees are increasingly cooperative about wanting to be immunized, wanting to be put in any treatment they need and getting on their way to becoming good Idaho citizens. They really are very willing and eager to be treated. They do not want to pose a risk to anybody either. Wow, yeah.

He's not okay. homme de Luca studied political science at encara University in in Ankara, Turkey in 1994. Then he moved to the United States where he took up his studies at Adelphi University. Then the University of Alberni, where he studied a little bit of business right after college, he went to work on a farm upstate and his father, who was like, Hey, bro, I need to do some more here. How about you know, we got this awesome artisanal feta cheese going on? Why don't you bring some of that stateside, their cheese sucks. Why don't you try and sell it over there. So he convinced Humpty to do this. He started up his own little minor cheese operation. And he did it for two years. But at the end of it, he was only able to really break even with the business. And so he walked away from the feta cheese world, and, you know, sort of cut his losses sad day. Then in 2005 By chance homme de hula, Kaya noticed an ad for a craft yogurt plant that was shutting down. His lawyers and most of the people in his circle told him not to, but he decided to buy it and decided to start making some yogurt. Okay, he even went so far as to rehire some of the craft employees who were laid off after the thing went out of business where they A Syrian immigrant they were not okay. Well, I don't know.

And how the real fortunes are made these days has filed a ridiculous publicity stunt lawsuit, in my research, opinion and view against Alex Jones and Infowars. Now the owner literally is a super good buddy with George Soros helping run the refugee program bringing unvetted Islamist and others into the country that's happening. None of that is even though some of the refugees are unvetted. We know some of them have been carrying out crimes. And this guy is a proponent of that. So when the so called Islamic pilgrims or the Islamic colonist crimes attack people in a manner all the things that are going on it then falls on those some of the guilt who have been promoting this, who have been pushing it doesn't mean that the owner of Chobani Hameed Lucaya fuck you from Turkey got here in the mid 1990s It doesn't doesn't mean all this to happen doesn't mean he's happy the rapes are taking place.

This is what they did before they kill you. They want me silence they want me under system so I can't speak out. While they quietly destroy me. All these little Lilliputians, it's not going to work. We're standing together. But this is the equivalent of the Alamo against the globalist or 300. I'm on the beach with our listeners, the frontline battling any other talk show host other news sites and everybody else out there to support us. They don't want you to see my response to Chobani. They're not going to put it anywhere watch, we will, it's up to you to get it out. It's up to drugs, the positive wants to. But whatever, I need your help. I stand with everybody else. I stand with everybody else when they're under attack, when they're being boycotted, I understand, we hang together, we hang separate. I need your hopes, I need your prayers, I need your financial support. And I need you to spread the links and the articles on critical news and information.

And support those local sponsors don't sit there and think somebody else is going to do it or Oh thank god Alex is there and I'm not chastising you. But this is the main battle. This is the main enemy assault. It's every week new attacks and we're getting stronger in the face of it because you're pulling through for us but we got to keep pulling hard here are the globalist are going to absolute if people say oh he acts like a football coach.

This is what the globalist don't want you to see. Because we are so effective. They know we got Trump elected. They know you got Trump elected. They know nationalism, racism got Trump elected races, and global isms alliance with Islam will be their final fall. But you look at this guy that owns Chobani coming from nowhere hooked in with George Soros, the UN involved in this whole program, which the UN admits it's meant to end Western civilization. And you understand it's part of a large globalist operation which we are standing against. And that's why they're trying to shut us down.

Because if you spread the word and spread our articles and videos and get past the censors and the bots and if you buy our products, nothing can stop. We will defeat these people. This is my fight. This is your fight. This is our fight against a bye bunch of authoritarian globalist third world populations allied with the global elite who are totally cold blooded. This is world war three, its economic, its cultural, and we will win it. And in closing do this is a spiritual battle all of us as imperfect as we are need to hit our knees before the Son of God, Jesus Christ and ask that he give us guidance, and that he intercede with the Father, to give us the will, and the determination and the judgment, to lead guide and direct us with the discernment it takes to break the purely wicked and foul spirited system of globalism, Islam and modern liberalism that is all combined as a trifecta of evil against us. But our trifecta is much stronger. You won't find it in the globalist churches, you'll find it your heart and soul, and your communion with God, in that quiet place the most high that we have the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and we are unstoppable. But this is the epic fight. And we are standing against the Islamist economic takeover and all their bully. And if you breathe air into our sails, and financially support us, and spread our links and articles and pray for us, we are unstoppable.
