{{ExternalRedirect}}'''Kanye West''', also known as "Ye" after a legal name change in 2021, is an American rapper, fashion designer, and virulently antisemitic person. As of late 2022, Ye has closely aligned himself with noted alt-right bigots like [[Candace Owens]], [[Nick Fuentes]], [[Laura Loomer]], and [[Milo Yiannopoulos]].

On December 1st, 2022, Alex hosted Kanye West and and Nick Fuentes on his show, where everyone (including Alex) spouted wildly antisemitic nonsense for multiple hours. See Episode #753 (when it comes out).
