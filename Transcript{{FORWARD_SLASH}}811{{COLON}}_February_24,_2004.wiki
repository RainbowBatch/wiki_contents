No. So one thing you'll notice in that clip is that there's this far greater emphasis on Opposition to marriage equality at this point in time, because that was the battle that conservatives were trying to fight. Most of society was making progress on that front and the forces that seek to oppose the tide of equality and regress back to more restrictive times. They just couldn't handle that. It's a very similar impetus that we see in terms of the right wing's obsessive and grotesque behavior surrounding trans people today. And I would guess that if present day, Alex were back on air in 2004, he'd be yelling about gay marriage being all about satanic pedophilia, or whatever. Also, in this clip, we get to be introduced to a new name, Angel Shamaya. This isn't someone who's come up on our radar before, so I'm gonna give you a little bit of a rundown. Okay, this person all right. Shamaya ran a popular gun rights website called Keeping bear arms, which he would eventually go on to sell to some conservative lobbying groups. Prior to that, though, he was a fairly big figure in the scene for folks like Alex, his site would have a gun news that cater to the worldview of gotten absolutist. They had like an aggregator kind of news headlines and stuff. Gotcha. In 2006, Angel was arrested and if you only consulted the gun, absolutist blogs and message boards, well, you'd come away with the impression that he'd been completely screwed. The police just showed up at his house one day for no reason and found a couple of handguns that he hadn't properly registered and decided to jam him up.

When the police arrived at his home they found 10 long guns 15 unregistered handguns and over 17,000 rounds of ammo. Naturally, the gun weirdo community minimized his ridiculous cache of weapons and pretended that he hadn't made domestic violence threats so that he could keep propping him up as a hero and raise money for his legal fees. After all, it's important to understand that if someone who happens to be a gun weirdo gets in trouble for threatening to kill his ex girlfriend. Next thing you know the second amendment is gone.

The city can't spare the police. But they can for 10s of 1000s of screaming people waving Mexican flags on Cinco de Maya. City Austin cancels Texas Independence Day Parade, the sponsor Cinco de mio and everything else as long as it's not Texan. The University of Texas canceled Texas independence day over 10 years ago, but they ended the university department from supporting it.

    | text      = Once again, Alex doesn't really know what he's talking about here, but he's close to a general point. In 2002, the city council of Austin passed Resolution 200 to 1003 Dash 040, part of which had to do with which events were granted an automatic waiver of fees. Most of these events are ones that are co sponsored with the city, and there's five of them in number. There's fiesta de independencia, which is not Cinco Demayo, the Veterans Day Parade, the Juneteenth Parade, which is not Kwanzaa, the Martin Luther King Day Parade and a commemorative event for September 11. Right, those are the five that the 2002 resolution granted automatic waivers to outside of these events, which are specifically co sponsored by the city and thus have their fees waived, you can apply to have those fees that you would accrue waived as well. It requires the support of three council members and the council needs to quote find that the program or project serves a public purpose. In theory, all of the other events that make Alex so mad are ones that went through those proper channels and applied for fee waivers, or they may have actually accepted the burden of paying those fees themselves. The Texas Independence Day Parade in Austin is run by a nonprofit called Celebrate Texas and in the previous year, they'd paid all the fees themselves, which totaled approximately $5,000. This year, the fees they would need to offset were $11,800, which they said they couldn't afford. The city wasn't keen to co sponsor the parade since there had been a ton of requests for fee waivers, and they couldn't afford to just rubber stamp all of them. One thing that I think it's important to recognize is that this isn't a super long standing tradition. Celebrate Texas only started doing their parades in 2000. And even without the parade, they still held a large celebration at the Capitol and fun was had by all very family. Yeah, also they were able to make a huge stink out of not getting their fees waived and they were able to use the political clout that they had to get future sponsorship of their parade into an emergency agenda for the City Council. Oh my god on January 29 2004, which was prior to the episode of Alex's show we're listening do now by about a month the motion to authorize the waiver for celebrate Texas as parade and their fun run was approved. A month in the past

They had that year on the city's tab like the thing at the Capitol. And then on February 26, a couple days after this episode that we're listening to now, the City Council passed a resolution adding the Celebrate Texas parade and run to the list of city code sponsored events assuring that they would get an automatic waiver for the city fees every year from then on.

In response to public backlash from folks who definitely aren't mad about holidays celebrated by a non celebrated product predominantly by non white people, they were able to almost immediately get reimbursed for fees paid and get their event added to a shortlist of city co sponsored events. It all worked out exactly how Alex would have wanted, except that there wasn't a parade this year, which is really no one's fault, but the organizers so he shouldn't really, you know, be complaining about Ivy if he's wants to complain about anybody he should be complaining about celebrate Texas.

The other thing that this bill would do is add mumps Hepatitis B and chickenpox to the vaccines that were required to enter public school. That's because these vaccines for these illnesses didn't exist when the first bill was originally passed. Okay. very ill. Yeah, but hepatitis B vaccine wasn't around until the late 60s, reliable mumps vaccination didn't come around until the early 60s. And the chickenpox vaccine wasn't approved for us use until 1995. This bill is really all just updates, and it doesn't even relate to homeschooled children at all, as this coverage is trying to make it presented. West Virginia was just saying that these vaccines were required to go to public school and if you tried to create fraudulent proof of vaccination, you'd be fined, which was already the case. Yeah. So this bill ended up passing the Senate, but it died in the house and Health and Human Resources Committee, and so it wasn't ever actually enacted. But consider the headline of the article that Alex is reading about this from world and that daily, quote, Bill forces shots on all children. That is not accurate. Okay. The article says this, quote, the legislation, Senate Bill 439, stipulates, quote, any parent or guardian who refuses to permit his or her child to be immunized, close quote, would face a criminal charge. That's complete bullshit, and a bald faced lie. That part of the article, it uses these words from the bill, quote, any parent or guardian who refuses to permit his or her child to be immunized. That's the part that's from the bill, right. But in the bill itself, it says this, quote, any parent or guardian who refuses to permit his or her child to be immunized and is not exempted from immunization. From there it goes on to say the it'd be a Mr. meanor. And you'd get a fine. Yeah, but all of that language is actually from the original act from 1931. Not from this new amendment, but it's still they cut out the part where it's and do not exempt it.

And people's response is just like, nope, yeah. And then it's just, there's nowhere else to go. And so you create a lot of elaborate, sort of, make us silly, put on arguments. Yeah. So it's important to understand what the objective and action being taken here is the guy who wrote this article, it WorldNetDaily doesn't care about this bill. Alex doesn't care about this bill. And the homeschool organizations protesting this bill don't care about it either. They aren't homeschool organizations. They're anti Vax groups, and they don't like that West Virginia has vaccine requirements for public schools. They know full well that this bill is nothing more than a slight updating of some terms and has nothing to do with homeschooled children being forcefully vaccinated. But pretending that that is the case is the only way to use this as an opportunity to push the anti Vax agenda. This World Net Daily article starts quote, West Virginia homeschooling families and others were scheduled to stage two rallies today to protest a bill but a little bit later you find out that the rallies were organized by a group called West Virginians for vaccine exemption. The other group that's behind the rallies is a group called human life International, a Catholic anti abortion organization. Seems weird. This is the little sleight of hand that's going on here. The bill itself doesn't make choosing not to be vaccinated anymore or less difficult. West Virginia required proof of vaccination to go to public school before this, and this bill wouldn't change that. It's a non issue for homeschoolers, but if it's presented as if it is, there's a better chance of using it to inflame people. If you present this as like an anti vaccine issue or if you're upfront that weird leads anti abortion group that spearheading this outrage. Yeah, that would make people weird. You make it kind of easy for people to write you off immediately. Yeah, if you hide your real cards behind the image of homeschoolers you give cover to what you really are up to and you you create an argument that you're not actually making people think you're making right and so they engage with the wrong point and you can kind of get people on their back foot right

There was previous language that allowed students to enroll in public school if they had a quote certificate from a reputable physician showing that immunization for any or all is impossible or improper or sufficient reason why any or all immunizations should not be done. In the updated version. That language is stricken because it's redundant to the part where it says that children have to be immunized or be quote exempted from immunization. It was unnecessary language and if it weren't stricken out, don't pretend that Alex wouldn't do an hour on what the state would consider a reputable physician.

There's nothing in this bill about anybody getting arrested or CPS taking anybody's children. That's ridiculous. The only punishment that's ever mentioned is that fine which existed before this bill that was being updated to meet inflation. Further, there are not 35 mandatory shots. There are nine, diptheria, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis, chickenpox, tetanus and whooping cough. Prior to this bill, there were six again because it was written in 1931. And I believe that it's actually even less actual shots because like measles, mumps and rubella Yeah, right. I mean, like it's, it's not nine, but even if it were, it's not 35 Nope, nope.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:44:55.000
    | text      = So here's a little history lesson. Yeah, Texas declared independence in 1830. e6 After a brief revolution that it is fair to say it was fought by a coalition of white colonists from the United States and to hornos. The term to honto just means Hispanic people who live in Texas prior to Texas becoming a state. And then the term is used to describe people who are descended from such family share. A whole lot of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas is just taken from the US Constitution, and its primary author was a man named George Campbell Childress, who was from Tennessee and was very, not very much not somebody who would qualify as Tejano. He went to Mexican territory, then returned to Tennessee to recruit people to fight for Texas independence. When he returned, he wrote the Constitution and then he failed repeatedly to open Law Offices in Texas. Five years after writing the Texas Constitution, he took his own life by slashing his abdomen with a bowie knife. So that's a tragic end to child risks the author of the Texas independence why constitution, what a story in earnest, the Republic of Texas only existed for a handful of years, it was less than 10 years between the declaration of independence from Mexico and the absorption into the United States. So it's not like there was a really rich history here. In all likelihood, they never really would have even declared independence if the United States had supported the revolution in the first place. And the alliance of us colonists and the part of the Toronto population that supported them would have been happy to just become a state in 1835. Yeah, there were four presidents of Texas with Sam Houston serving two non consecutive terms, and they were all white dudes. What? Yeah, there were five vice presidents of Texas, four of whom were white dudes. Every vice president who served an actual term in office was a white dude from the United States. The interim vice president when they declared independence, however, was a Toronto man named Lorenzo de Zavala. Zavala was involved with the passing of the Constitution, but he didn't write it. This is who Alex is almost certainly talking about it. It would have to be he was also only vice president for a few months before he was replaced by the son of a plantation owner from Georgia named Mira boo Lamar, whose biggest claim to fame was how aggressively he tried to read Texas of Native Americans. He took particular aim at the Cherokee people who used as a scapegoat in his campaign to ethnically cleanse Texas.

Yeah, he was vice president from 1836 to 1838, at which point he was elected President of the Republic of Texas Great. Incidentally, Alex's old studio was on South Lamar Street in Austin, the city that Mirabeau levar made the capital of Texas in 1839. Right. So that's a fun little quick glance. That is, I'm not a Santa Ana apologist or anything, but Alex's version of this history is complete bullshit. The movement for Texan independence did involve some Toronto individuals, but it was predominantly a project undertaken by white colonial settlers from the United States wanted to claim the territory for themselves. Every member of the first elected government of the Republic was a white man from the United States, from the President to the Vice President to the secretaries in various departments chair postmasters, general chair, every member of the second elected government of the Republic of Texas was a white dude from the United States. There may have been some lesser positions that I can't find record of, but I was unable to find a single person who was in an executive position or in a leadership position in Congress or in the courts. That was not a white man from the United States. Yeah, it is fair to say that Lorenzo de Zavala was the interim vice president and it is possible that he would have had a larger role in the government moving forward if he hadn't died of pneumonia later in 1836. But those are what if questions, and the fact of the Universal White American man government of the Republic of Texas, that that actually had? I think it speaks volumes. Also, I'm about 100% Sure, give or take, give or take probably about 100%. Give or take zero? Yes. I'm 100% Sure. 100% Sure. Alex doesn't knows of Allah's name.

    | timestamp = 00:54:57.000
    | text      = Yikes, none of these stories are real. It's all meaningless bullshit, Alex is obsessing over specifically to make himself mad so he can toy with the feelings and emotions of the audience. We're all becoming criminals and slaves, apparently, because of this litany of nonsense headlines completely disconnected from reality. Yeah, Alex is working backwards because the conclusion he has in mind is already established. And it's his job to find material that he can use to prop up that conclusion. The end goal is the conclusion that we're all becoming criminals by the state police state, blah, blah, blah. So in order to push that forward, push towards that the headlines and how they're discussed must serve that purpose. He can't cover reality in real world terms, which isn't to say that he would want to anyway, right, but he literally can't without his messaging becoming completely incoherent. Let's take this Texas Independence Day Parade, story, as a great example, the city of Austin didn't say that they couldn't have a parade, it was just an issue where the fees weren't automatically waived, and the nonprofit who runs the parade couldn't afford to cover that bill. So the parade was canceled. If Alex covered this story, in line with reality, there's a problem that exists, which is that this bill needs to be paid. He loves Texas independence day, and he wants that parade so he could possibly pay that bill himself. But at this point in his career, he may not be able to throw around that kind of cash. So let's go the other way with it. He has a big audience. And the challenge of raising like $11,000 for this very important event would be super easy. If he wanted to solve the problem he claims to be so upset about it would be easy. But he doesn't do this because the parade not existing isn't really the problem. That's the mask that he has put on the problem. The real thing Alex is complaining about is that he feels like white people are treated mainly by the city government, but Hispanic community members aren't. That's the real story that he's covering a shit about the parade is just window dressing. That's why he can't even mention the parade being canceled without saying that the city sponsors the Cinco Demayo Parade, which isn't even true. It's because he needs both of these elements to be present for the story that he wants to tell, which is about a white victimhood narrative. That's why he can't just cover the real details of this story. And why he has no interest in using his platform to propose a productive solution, paying for the fees. So this group can have their parade solves the problem of the parade being canceled. But it doesn't solve the actual problem that Alex is talking about, which is that his white feelings are hurt. Anyway, a lot of Alex's coverage works this way. If you pay attention, you'll often notice that the thing he's pretending to talk about isn't really what he's interested in. But that there's something behind the pretense that is what he's actually talking about. Right. And I think it's I think it's really key to do you know, 100% in mind,

And it's only going to happen forever. Because if you actually look at somebody in the eye and say, I want you to give preferential treatment to white people all the time, they will just say no, right? But instead, if you go well, I want you to give white people preferential treatment this time, they'll also go, No, instead you go, if you give anybody else treatment, that's better than my uncle everybody, you know, like, it's insane.

Remember when God when God came out and everybody put up point Esther's information on the on the internet? Oh, yes, I think that we ought to have a website called tarred and feathered. Norton started.com is taken, but it looks like a small potato guy. And it's ready to expire in April, but current other.net is still available. And if we put up all these new world, cronies, information, anybody anyway, we'll close by them to go talk to them. You know, I mean, on reddit.com or.net. But just an idea, you know, I tried to find a lot of information on a lot of people is because I'd like to know where they are. And

A lie about them very briefly, and then go to the calls, hoping to get callers to say angry things about the stories that he's covering. Maybe there'll be a guest, maybe his water sponsor will show up. And then at the end, he'll promise to like, do a news Blitz and get into the stories. And then he'll just read the headlines over again, and then call it good.

Is Alex saying that he gets this question like, yeah, every day and a million emails every day. probably an exaggeration, but I do believe that he probably gets it quite a bit and that is because the mentality that Alex perpetuates the coverage the editorial positions of his Joe would lead somebody who doesn't know that much about computers, maybe isn't that tech savvy, they would see that and be like, Oh my god, yeah, the government's trying to get me because I access this forbidden information that Alex is totally. And so obviously, that makes sense that these people would think Oh, absolutely, I like is fostering that kind of engagement with the world in his audience.
