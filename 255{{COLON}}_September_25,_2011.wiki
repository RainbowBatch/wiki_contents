Today, Policy Wonk Joshua has sent Dan and Jordan back to 2011 to see what Alex Jones thought about the Occupy Wall Street protests. Dan chose this day because it was the day after around 80 peaceful protesters were arrested, and it seemed like Alex might be mad about that. The gents get into this and also speculate that Alex just discovered The Who in 2011.
