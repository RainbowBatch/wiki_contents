'''Owen Shroyer''' is a host on InfoWars and frequent co-host of Alex Jones. As the "protege" of Jones, his content on InfoWars was a recurring subject at the Texas trial in Austin. He semi-frequently works as a "man on the street" or remote correspondent.

Shroyer often makes statements about the sexual fetish of Cuckold and has strong opinions about the subject.. He believes that people who go along with the mainstream media are cucks. In an interview with ''The Tab'' Shroyer said that he defines "a cuck" as someone "someone who's weak-minded, or will kowtow to whatever the authority says. They're never gonna question anything and they're never gonna look into anything for themselves. They're just going to go along with the mainstream, they're never gonna have an original thought. "

Shroyer was arrested after his antics at the first Trump Impeachment, but came to an agreement to complete a few hours of community service and stay away from the Capitol.

On Jan 6th, he accompanied Alex Jones onto the Capitol Grounds, but didn't enter the building. As a result of his breached prior agreement, Owen was arrested and charged.
