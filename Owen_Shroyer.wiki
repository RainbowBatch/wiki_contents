'''Owen Shroyer''' is a host on InfoWars, and Alex Jones wannabe. He semi-frequently works as a "man on the street" or remote correspondent.

Owen was arrested after his antics at the first Trump Impeachment, but came to an agreement to complete a few hours of community service and stay away from the Capitol.

On Jan 6th, he accompanied Alex Jones onto the Capitol Grounds, but didn't enter the building. As a result of his breached prior agreement, Owen was arrested and charged.
