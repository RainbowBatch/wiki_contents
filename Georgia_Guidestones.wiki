'''The Georgia Guidestones''' were a mysterious monument located in Elbert County, Georgia, USA<ref>https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/georgia-guidestones</ref>. The identity of the person or group who financed and erected the monument is not publicly known.

On July 6, 2022, the monument was bombed. It was badly damaged, and removed for safety reasons later the same day.

Erected in 1980, these large granite slabs had inscriptions in several languages, outlining principles or guidelines for humanity's future. The monument's main features include a set of four granite stones, standing upright to form a large, squared arch, with a central pillar holding a horizontal stone. The inscriptions on the stones, which remain a subject of controversy and speculation, include statements like "Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature."

The stones were a frequent foil for conspiracy theorists like [[Alex Jones]], who argued that the statements on the stones represent the intention of the [[Globalists]] to limit human population.
