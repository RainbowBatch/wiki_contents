==Detailed Show Notes==

Dan and Jordan discuss an update to things in the world of Project Camelot. Kerry Cassidy announces that she is going to a subscription model with her videos behind a pay-wall, and thus the show's coverage of her interviews is likely coming to a close.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/research/2020/6/1/episode-437-gawain-with-a-telescope Episode 437: Gawain With a Telescope]</ref>

For a last right, Dan and Jordan listen to her be interviewed by an Infowars associate named Shepard Ambeliss, which is very dumb.
