Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened between Feb. 12-16, 2009 on The Alex Jones Show. Basically, Alex can't stop talking about state legislatures introducing meaningless resolutions, but gets sidetracked from it just long enough to give some of the most reckless advice a radio host could possibly give. Also, he sings along with some country songs. [Note: apologies about the slight audio glitch]
