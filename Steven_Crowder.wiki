'''Steven Crowder''' is a conservative political commentator, comedian, and host of the online show "[[Louder with Crowder]]." Crowder has faced criticism for his ties to the far right, including [[Alex Jones]]. As of mid-2023, Alex and Crowder have become closely associated, with Alex semi-regularly hosting Crowder's show and/or filming [[The Alex Jones Show]] from Crowder's studio.

Crowder has aligned himself with various far-right figures and movements, often espousing their views on his show and through his online presence. He tends to target a much younger audience than [[InfoWars]], and is much more prone to trying to hide his hateful ideas behind shock-jock comedy. This is probably why he's somehow still on YouTube and other social media sites.
