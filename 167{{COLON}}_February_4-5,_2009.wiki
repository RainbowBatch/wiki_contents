Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened on the February 4th and 5th, 2009 episodes of the Alex Jones Show. Alex tries to make a big deal out of an Al Gore clip he's stolen from Glenn Beck, he does some profoundly disturbing impressions, then manages to be embarrassed by no less than three guests he has invited on the show.
