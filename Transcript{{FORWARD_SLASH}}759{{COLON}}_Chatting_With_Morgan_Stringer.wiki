    | text      = So um, do you know you're you're aware Jordan of how you get really mad when the media reports things about Alex and then it turns out to not really be that thing?

    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:02:42.000
    | text      = Yeah. Dan is data some of wild crazy one. So we're missing that tornado with energy. But so speaking of that, I have the same thing where I'll, I'll have that same reaction when I see the press get these things wrong about, you know, disapprobation figures or pop culture figures. And also, with the law, it really frustrates me how, you know, we do have a lot of good legal reporters, Liz Williamson, for instance, she's done a great job on this. But Oh, of course, a lot of other people just need to stop, they need to stop. So. So frustrated, because I see the headline, and I see some tweets, you know, that, of course have 50,000 likes on them by this point saying, oh, Alex doesn't have to pay for one and a half billion dollar judgment, or he does have to pay that one and a half billion dollar judgment and a judge has, you know, taken away his ability to fight it. And of course, that's not what happened at all. So I thought I was crazy, actually, because I was saying, Well, you know, this, this outlet is saying it this happened. And I don't remember that happening. Have I you know, blacked out somehow and remembered something different. And no, it turns out, I was right. So it's a, there's a there is a consent judgment in place, which means that both Alex and the plaintiffs are agreeing to this. Everyone's in agreement.

    | text      = Okay, wow. Okay, first off, that's that's a monumentous thing that you just said.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:04:18.000
    | text      = Yeah, so what happened is the families who have already had their cases heard, they those cases, they have lifted the stay on that. But the only things that are left are, I guess, a formal entry of judgment in the Texas case, which that case has already been, you know, basically, it's already done. And it's just so the judge can enter the judgment. And then in Connecticut, the only two motions left are Norm has a motion of remittitur, which means he wants the judge to reduce the judgment and the Connecticut case. Because the number is big. I wish I was exaggerating that reasoning, but
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:04:55.000
    | text      = I made it when you're looking at a number like 1.5 better Really, and honestly, I feel like that's a reasonable ask just to be like, this numbers bigger than I understand. Yeah.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:05:07.000
    | text      = I mean, yeah, it's what do you divide it up by 15 people it and then you hear, you know, everything that happened and you hear the, you know, testimony in that courtroom, I could see where some people say, Oh, that's not even enough.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:05:20.000
    | text      = Oh, totally, totally. That was one of the things that I was thinking about in whenever the verdict was about to be handed down is, you know, before the Texas trial even happened, I said, the, I think it should be in the ballpark of 250 million or something along those lines. And it's like, how could a reasonable person though, get to a number that big? Like, I can't even understand what a million dollars is, in my real life, let alone a billion, you know,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:05:53.000
    | text      = yeah, well, you're kind of right on the money there. When you're talking about, you know, people like Robbie Parker, who did get about, I want to say total amount was 200 million, but including the punitive, and everything how it shakes out. But um, but yeah, so that's not what happened. What happened, though, is that the judgment has been lifted onto those cases just for procedural issues to go forward. Norm is also has a motion for a new trial, which everybody knows nor even knows that those Mote his motions are going to get denied. But basically, the bankruptcy court is saying, yeah, those judgments and go ahead and be entered, and then you can proceed with the appeals process. And those cases. Now, the Fontaine case and the Posner case, those are still stayed. Right as of right, right, right. So yeah, that's that's what's happening there. It was not a judge saying up, Alex has to write a check tomorrow, you know, and that's what I feel like a lot of people got wrong here. And also, I did want to say this hasn't come up yet. It has kind of come up in the background of the conversations, as I've kind of read between the lines, as I've listened to the attorneys speak in these hearings with Judge Lopez, and the bankruptcy court, but Bankruptcy Code section 533. A six actually prevents a debtor from being discharged for any debt for the willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity. So actually, awful and malicious injuries cannot be discharged in bankruptcy regardless. And okay, I think this is going to be litigated on if this counts, but I would say, you know, the punitive damages, which had to be awarded, if they were if, you know, you've the jury has found that his conduct was willful and malicious. I mean, it speaks to itself. Right. So I really just think that this these bankruptcies in the personal one and the company one is Alex delaying, because what I noticed was when I watched the latest Texas hearing, I saw Mark, essentially saying, Okay, well, we're fine to go ahead and schedule Fontaine and Posner because we can proceed against Alex Jones individually. And, you know, I get that lo and behold, December 2, he filed for personal bankruptcy. But I think that this is going to end up backfiring on him, I think his strategy here is that he is going to try to, you know, drag these families out, we're going to have to go through the whole bankruptcy process versus, you know, credit or committee and the personal one, there's, you know, we're going to have to submit plans to repay debt and negotiate all that out between all the creditors in the company one. So I think what he then does via appeals process, and I think what Alex is doing here is he's trying to number one, buy more time for himself. And number two, were these families down hoping that they'll settle?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:08:51.000
    | text      = Right, right. So essentially, whenever we read any reporting from the news for probably the next year or two, it should just be taken with a grain of salt. That means it's still going on. I mean, really, still a struggle.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:09:06.000
    | text      = Yeah. Any kind of, you know, illegal reporting, I feel needs, you know, huge asterisk behind it, you know, it's just I don't understand what's going on with legal reporting. And of course, I'm an attorney. So I'm picky about that. But it's still I just wish people would
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:09:23.000
    | text      = think you're running into you're running into a big problem with legal reporting. And so far as the people who read news wants something to have happened, and in the law, things are always about to happen. Oh, once that motion gets filed, then we'll see you in a couple of weeks. And once that couple of weeks happens, well, we'll file some more motions, you know, like that's kind of the struggle.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:09:49.000
    | text      = It is I and I definitely can see that. Yeah, I mean, there is a lot it doesn't make for a splashy headline, right.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:09:58.000
    | text      = Right. Yeah, things on go. hang there are some
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:10:01.000
    | text      = some things to add that you wish that they could have actually reported, like the fact that Alex was popping in and out of his latest hearing, it was virtually virtual on Zoom. And he kept you know, all right, hopping in and out, you know, talking.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:10:14.000
    | text      = What was what was he doing popping in and out?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:10:18.000
    | text      = I have no idea. I don't know if it was his zoom being glitchy. But yeah, I have no idea. I think he was just, uh, you know, again, it shows his lack of seriousness, you know, in the these cases, as usual. And of course, and yeah, his attorney actually claimed that he needed a basically did the I need money argument. So we one of the reasons why I think this is dumb is because now Alex is having to expose his finances. Right? He's having to risk right. And I think this was one of the dumbest things he could do when he filed for bankruptcy the first time I said, I can't believe he did that. So Jones is saying that his initially was saying his salary is 20,000 Every two weeks from the company bankruptcy filings?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:11:09.000
    | text      = I think I think most that's a that's a normal salary for most people, most average Joe's putting on their hard hats go into work every day. 20,000 every two weeks is regular, right?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:11:21.000
    | text      = I don't make a fraction of that much which, you know, maybe maybe I should be, you know, practicing law more like norm, which, you know, it was a whole other rant. But yeah, so the judge, the judge, but we
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:11:34.000

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:11:39.000
    | text      = I can, I can make those house payments in no time. Exactly. But yeah, so if a judge was asked, though, to force free speech systems to pay Jones 54,000 every two weeks, and the judge said, Okay, well, I want to address this later. And you're going to have to submit to me more than just I need money. So
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:12:01.000
    | text      = so if I so if I understand correctly. Alex's bankruptcy lawyer said to a judge, how about pay me almost three times as much every two weeks? And the reason is because I would like three times as much every two weeks.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:12:16.000
    | text      = That's what Alex himself was saying. Yes, that he made me paid out from from Infowars free speech systems. And hit Alex's lawyer also made the argument that if this was denied, that Alex will have to find more work.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:12:33.000
    | text      = Oh, god, yes, please, please. I want to see Alex's side gig. I want to see a side gig. If if you could watch Infowars broadcast, and then get in an Uber with Alex Jones. I think that would be the ultimate in in life really.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:12:54.000
    | text      = I which brings me to a question. I wanted to ask you, Jordan, what is the funniest job? What is the funniest second job that you think Alex could take?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:13:06.000
    | text      = I mean, the obvious answer would be mime. Because to sit to see him, you know, a street performing mime naturally he would have to be in the most public of spaces with the only restriction being a can't talk. Of course. That one's a good start. I think the other funny side job would be the person who feeds lions and then accidentally falls in in an Indiana Jones movie. That would be the way to go.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:13:37.000
    | text      = That was I mean he almost was a movie star. So
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:13:41.000
    | text      = yeah, see, he's it was it's either Star Lord or being eaten by lions in Indiana Jones movie I'm fine with both truly but that's it that's you bring up something you have been watching almost all of these hearings if not all of them and regularly live tweeting these out Have you been has it literally been all of the hearings

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:14:05.000
    | text      = um, I'm I think I may have because I did get a heads up from an attorney saying this is just a scheduling hearing you don't have to be here day off I didn't say it like that. He was very very nice about it but he was letting me know basically this is a meeting to schedule something in the future you know, just saying it's gonna be 10 minutes tops which I appreciate it but also I was just like, oh man, all these people are aware of me. Which

    | text      = That's like, that's like the most inverted Deep Throat that there ever could be like, there is a secret connection you have between the lawyers but in the in the parking alley. It's just hey, we'll see you tomorrow.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:14:59.000
    | text      = Yeah. I think there is actually, which, you know, I've been with all seriousness, I have been thanked by it. And I can't believe that they found anything of value as to what you know. I've said, but basically, yeah, so I, you know, notice, I've told you, you know, we just talked about this earlier where I'm not a big fan of a lot of legal reporting. And so I'm not a fan of a lot of legal analysts and law on crime was covering, you know, the first or baby actually covered the Connecticut trial, but I knew they're going to do a shameful job on that. And also, I knew a lot of bad actors. Were probably going to, you know, talk about the Texas trial and how Oh, poor Alex is being railroaded. And I really do not want that to happen. So what I do, because I don't know something is wrong with me was I decided to throw myself into the abyss and I said, Okay, I'm gonna watch this entire trial. And I'm going to just say what's happening and then give my legal analysis where I think I have some or give, you know, oh, this is what I would do. Or, you know, this is why I think Mark Bankston is doing X and here's, you know, where Renault was probably screwing up and needs to you know, change tactics and which happened, but not as much as not not

{{TranscriptBlock

    | text      = man, that was also a challenge. I was watching you know, especially with the Connecticut trial just thinking I can't even get in your head to see what you're trying to do. So with Norm Oh, wait norm with with no,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:16:34.000
    | text      = yeah, when you were watching the the Austin, the Texas trial, you can see right now is a professional who's trying to do a law job, if you will, in my in my dumb way of saying it. And norm seemed like he was just throwing caution to the wind, dropping smoke bombs and falling asleep all over the place, right.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:16:55.000
    | text      = Oh, man. It was like, oh, man, the ending when he did that litigators prayer, I asked Andrew, Andrew Torres who I work for him at the firm. But

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 00:17:06.000

    | timestamp = 00:17:16.000
    | text      = Oh, well, it doesn't apply to me. I can tell you that. Not yet. Not yet. The night is young. But by Yeah. So Norm, it was just baffling. And I asked Andrew, I said, Is this a thing? I've never heard this in my life. Please tell me this isn't a thing. And Andrew said, when I told him about it, he said, I have no idea what the fuck that man was talking about. And also just what you know, what's going south, which I always say juries are mysterious creatures, you don't want to, you know, get inside their heads too much and psych yourself out. Because who knows, when groups of people come together, you know, what I care about versus what they're not going to care about. That's why I really like the jury questions in Texas. But anyway, so. But you know, it's going bad when the jurors were, you know, avoiding eye contact with norm. And he acknowledged in his closing like, oh, some of you are looking away. Oh, man, that was that was so rough. And

{{TranscriptBlock

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:18:34.000
    | text      = Yeah, but I also think that this strategy was done because there are trustees assigned to bankruptcy cases. And there's a whole conversation about oh, well, Alex is just gonna get on the stand and lie. And we know how often, you know, perjury isn't prosecuted, especially for a civil case. Right? They are for bankruptcy, fraud on the bankruptcy? Oh, yeah. There are people assigned in every bankruptcy case, it's called a trustee. And what they do is they basically cut most of the time, they're just overseeing to make sure of a bankruptcy court. And you know, it's going along smoothly, and everything's working according to procedure. But and these kinds of cases

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:19:18.000
    | text      = it is not and because of the types of bankruptcy that he has filed here, you have a little bit more supervision here from the US Trustee. And basically what they can do is that it's their job, essentially, one of their major jobs is to look for fraud and make sure fraud isn't being done. And if they suspect it, they refer it to the Department of Justice, and it's investigated or oftentimes prosecuted. And a lot of times when that happens, they uncover a bunch of other crimes because chances are if you're lying to a bankruptcy court, you're probably not you know, up and up on the up and up on your books. Right. So yeah,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan

    | text      = I was gonna say if you're one of these trustees at this point, you have to be Like, rubbing your hands together with maniacal Glee or something like that, right? Like, you look at everything Alex has done so far. And you go, Well, I don't know if I can fall asleep without hitting fraud on the way down. Like, it is unreal, right?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:20:17.000
    | text      = Yes. And you have to disclose, you know, these different assets, which I think, to me, I was thinking, Well, I would be paying especially close attention here, because it's going it might indicate where he has hidden some of his assets. Sure. And yeah, so you deaf? I was bewildered when he did. I mean, it's, it's no another delay tactic. And I think he's trying to get these families again, to settle and just agree to a lesser amount just so he goes away. But I mean, his behavior has been completely shameful, beyond shameful here, and I wouldn't. Why would you settle with him at this point?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:20:57.000
    | text      = No, it feels, uh, feels a little bit like he is almost pot committed to the strategy of like, stringing it out as long as I possibly can. And then maybe Hail Mary, they'll they'll get tired. But I mean, at this point, it's hard to imagine that being possible.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Morgan Stringer
    | timestamp = 00:21:17.000
    | text      = Yeah, it's going to and, you know, I know, we talked about earlier how it feels like there's a motion to, you know, do another motion later and things like, comes to an end. Yeah. And that, and that's, this is where that's going to come into play. And, yeah, we'll see where, and also, Alex wanted to join the bankruptcies together and have them proceed together. And this way, you know, whatever applied to the personal bankruptcy would apply to the company bankruptcy, both trustees, which I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer, but I used to work for a firm that did some of it. I have never seen a trustee object to joining bankruptcies. And the reason

So when you think about it that way, you know, it doesn't make the money seem as overwhelming and large, I mean, almost you almost do you get that situation where you're like, man, is it you know, is this even enough but you know, time will tell with that but I'm we'll see where it goes. Well, I

How many people saw the this information? How many people were influenced by this information? And, you know, you think, Oh, 1.5 billion is is a lot. But if you just had all of those people who were taken in, give $1, we'd be at $3 billion, or whatever. Do you know what it's like, relatively speaking, that harm has caused is so huge. That because we're so unused to money being that big. It's hard to wrap our minds around

So I think, there there's, you know, there's there's the equivalence, but we'll we'll see what happens on the appeal for the Texas case on it, that punitive damage cap applies, we'll get to see norm, lose, but I don't expect him to win these motions. I say that now.

Or is this like, there's gotta be a reason just making myself mad as I'm watching all these hearings. But, you know, it's, we'll see where that goes there.

Whenever Ray now found out the next morning after Mark had dramatically revealed the texts, right. The next morning before they they the jury had gone to deliberation. I remember Ray Nall just going to talk to the judge and just being like, um, we would like to have that not have happened. Can we get an extension on the 10 days or something? He's just say he just said I want to do over. It's like, that's, that's unreal. But then, you know, now norm is like, how about you just make us pay five bucks knee?

As much as one of the moments from the Connecticut trial that cracked me up was I can't remember exactly what what it was at the moment. But Judge Bella said, Hey, we're having a discussion about objections and such and then, you know, Judge Bella said, Well, I'm assuming there will be an appeal to which Norm said what if we win, to which judge Bella's repeated herself and said, I'm assuming there's going to be an appeal. You know, this is outside the presence of the jury and everything. It just cracks me up. Oh, she was just like, buddy. Um, yeah, so that is, I've enjoyed, you know, a little moments like that. And I've certainly had my fun there. But you know, when Alex's lawyer say things like how he'll need a second job if he doesn't make millions of dollars, you know, who among us? So, yeah, that's been fun, too. So I've enjoyed those moments. And another moment that had me absolutely cracking up in the last Texas hearing was, Ronaldo was there and judge Maya wanted him to get his poster board, you know that he had his little props. I think you'll remember
