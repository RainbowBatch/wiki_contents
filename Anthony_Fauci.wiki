'''Anthony Fauci''' is a  physician / immunologist with a long history of work in public service. He rose to national prominence because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and became a primary target for COVID-denialists and other types of wingnuts because of his position and prominence within the US COVID response. In particular, he has become a primary target of [[Alex Jones]]' antivax / COVID-denial narratives. In August of 2022, Fauci announced he would be retiring.

Amusingly, the first time Fauci was mentioned on InfoWars (at least in connection with the 2020 pandemic) was when [[Steve Pieczenik]] claimed that Fauci was in fact, a force for good, citing the idea that Steve and Anthony had gone to school together (read, same school at the same time. The actual extent of their overlap is not clear.).
