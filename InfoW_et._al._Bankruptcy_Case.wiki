In mid-April 2022, just days before the Texas Sandy Hook Case was due to go to trial, three companies related to InfoWars filed for Chapter 11 Section V bankruptcy protections. This immediately paused all litigation against these companies, which included the Texas Sandy Hook Case, the Connecticut Sandy Hook Case, and the Fontaine Case.

As would become clear through subsequent disclosures, before April 1st, 2022, these businesses had no income, employed no-one, and held no assets. Prior to being placed into bankruptcy, these companies were solely owned and controlled by Alex Jones. In common parlance, they were shell companies, existing in name only.

It appeared, and plaintiffs alleged (in this context, plaintiffs are claimants, since they would have a claim on the bankrupt entities assets if their claims were successful) that this bankruptcy was a delay tactic, and an attempt to force a settlement.

The case was overseen by [[Judge Chris Lopez]]. Eventually, in June 2022, the bankruptcy was dismissed.
