Today, Dan tells Jordan all about a very groundbreaking episode of [[The Alex Jones Show]], where we get a sense of where Alex's martyr complex comes from, and whether Alex prefers "facts" or "lore."

This episode was broadcast the day after LaVoy Finnecum was killed at the Oregon Wildlife Preserve Standoff. That event has put Alex Jones into the kind of headspace where he accidentally says a number of things that he usually keeps inside, and luckily, Knowledge Fight is here to bring those things to light.
