    | text      = So Jordan, today we have an episode to do. We're going to be going back to the past to 2003 one we're gonna be talking about December 5 2003. And the reason for this is we've been covering a lot of stuff lately. That's been the a business. Yes. Alex's response to it does a bit of wind tests. And so I think this stuff is really important to discuss and important to cover Okay, and we're not going to not continue to, nor are we going to not follow Alex in the present in such of course, but we I think you run the risk of if we only talk about that stuff. Yeah, it gives a overwhelming perception of maybe how uniform it is, you know what I mean? Like, if if our show is all that right, I worry about the listeners taking in too much of that and like giving the sense that we think that everything all around is white supremacist and Nazis. Jumping off, I need a little break from time to time, right. A little break. He has something break. Yes. And I think the past is great.

    | text      = True. And you're not really learning anything. In the present generally. It's kind of watching stuff and being like, Oh, this is bad. Whereas when you go back to the past, there's actually like, illuminating things. There's stories that are interesting, that have implications should learn things about the way Alex, his brand has evolved over the years naturally. And I think that that is something that I find far more captivating than him failing to interview a couple of guys who love Yeah,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 06:21
    | text      = yeah, no, I mean, what's interesting about the past is that when you can look at something and then see what consequences did occur. There's a lot more interesting stuff to be learned from that because you have actual evidence of what will happen if you do this thing in this circumstance. Whereas if you stay in the present all too often, I mean, it does feel like we're constantly within the same framework and minor details are changing. You know, Nick Fuentes hasn't said something new. We haven't heard about white supremacist before,

So, there's another story, Alex, you know, when we're in the past, yeah, one of the things that Alex does is he has like the roundup of the stories, and then a loadable shit for about two and a half hours. And then the last segment of the show is him repeating those headlines redoing the roundup news. Yeah, hit the news, banging it out. And so here's some of the stories that we're gonna he has here's, here's a big one.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 11:31
    | text      = Also, when I saw this Toronto Star article, headline girl six locked in dryer for weeks at a time, I knew automatically it would be CPS. The way the headline was written, I knew that they would call it the mother and then bury in the article that it was si PS because about 90% of the time when I hear about someone being tortured or killed in their parents custody. The bottom of the article, they will say that it was a foster parent or CPS.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 12:01
    | text      = I spent quite a bit of time trying to track this story down but I was unable to find the actual news story that was covering this case. But right off the bat, it can't be the CPS because this is a story that happened in Canada where the US child protective service doesn't have any jurisdiction have extradition now, okay, the Toronto Star article itself isn't online anymore, and the wayback machine doesn't have a snapshot of it. But cruising around, I was able to find some other cases that Alex might want to consider. And late October 2003, a 23 year old mother in Summerville, Georgia was arrested for throwing her eight month old into a dryer, or in November 2000, a woman in Niles, Miss Michigan was arrested for shutting her six year old son in a running dryer to punish him for playing hide and seek during which time he had hid in the dryer Jesus Christ. One of the things that I sadly learned while prepping this episode is that apparently people put babies and dryers more than you'd think which is horrible. Even if you grant that all the details of the story Alex is telling are true, it's still not a valid point. There are definitely valid critiques of the CPS and foster care system to be made. And anything that can be done to protect the children in that world is a moral imperative to pursue. But abuse like this happens in all different contexts. The image that Alex is trying to present is that it never happens between a parent and a child. And whenever there's a headline that reads like that's the case, it's secretly a situation where the CPS is abusing children and trying to blame it on parents because the globalist tape families Yeah, in hindsight, it really shouldn't come as a huge surprise that Alex got caught up in shit like pizza gate, the Wayfair stuff, and pretty much every other child abuse Satanic Panic we've seen over the last years, he's never really taking the issue seriously. So what he's doing now is more or less the natural progression of what you see even back in 2003 Yeah, it's a cartoonish pneus around a fairly serious issue.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 13:46
    | text      = Yeah, yeah. I mean, that is that is one of the one of those things where I can definitely understand the desire to think that it only would be an evil organization that could do that, you know, like that is that is one of those things where you want to retreat from the idea that a parent, no matter what the circumstances could even do that, you know, yeah, I get that. But also No, that's not how it works.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 14:11
    | text      = Right? Um, that's that's one example of a few actually, I think that you're gonna see on this episode of places where conspiracy theories serve to make things feel more like you think they should be. Right. Right. And that's, that's maybe an underappreciated dynamic of some of the the narratives that people put out. Yeah, absolutely. can't possibly be this. That doesn't make sense to me emotionally, intuitively, right, whatever. Or even just hopefully, yeah, so Alex reads these headlines right and he knows these articles, he knows what they say before even reads them.

    | timestamp = 14:47
    | text      = And I read the article and of course, as always, it was exactly as it normally is. So I know what's in these articles before I read them.

The Cedar Fire being remembered as the most severe of the bunch. The first one on October 21, was called the roadblock to fire and this one was accidentally started at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton on the firing range. This was a particularly complicated fire response because it was on federal land and beyond that, just consider all the things that could explode at a marine base. And you can get some sense of how delicately fire teams needed to tread Yeah, and it ended up being pretty bad. Yeah, as shitty as this sounds, fires at these bases. It's not a terribly uncommon thing. I was able to find examples of fires breaking out just at Camp Pendleton in 2008 and 2014 and that was barely even putting any effort into looking

So many of the other fires were smaller in nature, but they contributed to an environment where firefighting resources were spread thin made worse by a dry season, and the arrival of some bad Santa Ana winds that made fire spread much more easily. The Cedar Fire which the San Diego government describes as quote, the largest wildland fire in California history was started quote, when a hunter became lost and lit a small fire to signal for help. One of the other large fires called the old fire was started by an arsonist named Ricky Lee Fowler, who burned the house down after he was kicked out of it. The fire ended up killing five people and in 2013, he was found guilty of those murders and sentenced to death. Another of the large fires was the grand prix fire which was suspicious, but was called an accident by investigators in 2004, likely the result of an exhaust spark or cigarette but sure, I'm not sure what our evidence Alex is basing his claims on and he doesn't cite a single source other than his memories of unnamed news things he claimed to have seen. So it seems like maybe he's just talking shit. If I had to guess I would say that he's taking the fact that the Roblox to fire began at Camp Pendleton and then pretending that some of these other fires like the old or Grand Prix also had military involvement in their ignition. Sure, that seems in line with how his mind works and how he processes information, right? No,

This fire burned for just short of a month and ended up covering over 84,000 acres of land. And it was also in the woods, which fits Alex's description. Initially, folks thought that it was possibly caused by a lightning strike. But investigators fairly quickly ruled that out as none of the telltale signs were there. It's believed that it was human caused. And while the definite origin isn't known, there was a man who ended up being charged with and convicted of lying to investigators about whether or not he was smoking on the trail that day, exactly where the fire was known to have started, right. It's a pretty safe assumption that this was the inciting incident that caused the fire. Or I guess secret globalist military exercises involve setting off giant fires for some unknown and unachieved goal. Yeah, Alex is welcome to prove that if he wants, yeah, in the interest of full disclosure, the military does hold training exercises twice a year in that area, in a program called Angel funder. It's about personnel recovery, but it absolutely would not be taking place near the trail where the fire started. Yeah. And the program began in 2006. Sure, but there is that there is a base, right nearby this Mount Lemmon, right, the area where the fire was. And so it's conceivable that there might have been some sort of an exercise that pre existed. Angel thunder. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

But again, that was at the bottom of a two page article that it was a drill, but you're reading it having the emotional response. You see, this is what happens to an unconscious mass of people. It creates the perception your subconscious considers that there are all these terrorist attacks.

This is a completely different conspiracy narrative that he's expressing in the past. In this conception, he thinks that there are all these exercises because your unconscious mind will experience them as if they're real attacks. And you'll emotionally think that there are more attacks than there actually are. Because of your heightened state of subconscious fear. The globalists will be able to exploit you into supporting things that are sold to you in the name of protecting you from these attacks course, in more present times these exercises exist to give cover to real false flag attacks. For instance, the operation lockstep shit existed so that the globalists could plan the COVID-19 release. And if anyone was caught, they could say it was part of the exercise. Leaving aside how stupid that theory is. It's the it's worlds apart from this 2003 understanding of these exercises. And that's because at this point in 2003, Alex doesn't seem to have recognized the value of fully denying reality and calling everything falls flat.

I would go up try to disarm one gun and kill the others, I would fight them. My instinct is to fight thugs and fight scum.

This is the way that he wants people to see him because it helps make you more appealing to folks who fancy themselves also to be above politics, pendant thinker, right. But what Alex seems to actually mean is a bit different. He opposes bush, and because of that people on the right assume he's on the left, the left right paradigm he's against is the assumption that because you oppose a Republican, you must be attacking from the left, right. When Alex says he's above the left right paradigm, what he's essentially saying is that he wants to make people aware that you can attack the GOP from the right, yeah, based on his use of the term and his clear ignorance about pretty basic stuff in terms of politics and civics. I kind of think he doesn't understand that this is what he mean, you are 100% Correct.

The Council on Foreign Relations, which was words, puts out their foreign affairs brief every two months, it's in all major bookstores. It's called foreign affairs. That's their outward propaganda for the general public. Sure, but on their website and an interdepartmental reports and reports to the President or Congress, or to other private think tanks, they say what they're going to do. You've got P Knack project for New American Century, you've got the reports of the Carnegie Foundation, going back to the 30s, we have these, you've got the Ford Foundation battle plans, you've got RAND Corporation, then you've got then when you know who the members of these groups are, you see them then writing news articles for major magazines and newspapers and on the Sunday news shows, and you can see the different grades of propaganda they're putting out for different audiences.

And the reason for that is that he doesn't base his conspiracy bullshit on any actual sources, he skims headlines and makes up stories that are complementary to his extreme right wing white identity ideology, and points to a vague unspecific mass of official documents to give his narratives and unearned weight. I've tracked Alex's answer. And here is what he says in response to a very straightforward question about where these reports are that he's talking about. First, he brings up the CFR who have about five different kinds of reports, right? This seems to imply that all of these kinds of reports spring forth from the CFR maybe. So they put out the foreign affairs but Foreign Affairs is a public facing propaganda outlet. So that's not actually what we're talking about. It might still be one of the types of reports but it's still coded. So then you have the completely unspecific reference to all sorts of other reports that the CFR puts out to the President or internally or interdepartmental briefs whatever the fuck that means.

Then you have P neck, the Carnegie Foundation, and the Ford Foundation battle plan RAND Corporation, these things are just named dropped. But hearing these names doesn't help anyone find the sources Alex is talking about. If the Carnegie Foundation has reports going back to the 1930s, how does he expect anyone to know where to look? That's what like, is it just one type of report that they have? I imagine the Carnegie Foundation has so many different types of reports, right? Then you start to learn the names of the people in these groups and you see them writing articles. This is again, outward facing propaganda, but I guess you can use this to check your work against these internal documents to illustrate that they're putting out propaganda to the masses, right and speaking openly in secret, but these documents show that they're working towards a similar goal, right? This is all completely useless as an answer to this caller because Do you have nowhere to go with what you've been told? The caller is obviously looking for more information. And you would think that someone in Alex's position would be eager to give that person specifics about how they could find hard evidence that shows that Alex is right about the nonsense that he spouts. But in reality, the last thing Alex wants is for actually curious members of his audience checking in on any of this shit. Yeah, the game he's playing only works if sourcing is left vague and unexamined. So when he's asked a question like this, he does the equivalent of like, gesturing wildly and acting like a kid who's trying to bluff a book report. Yeah. And that's, that's what you see there.
