If you don't have a home that's up to code. And he's like, Nah, I'm being oppressed. So that's Alex's whole angle on Yeah. So that is being oppressed. That gets you up to speed on the 17th. That's one day after Donald Trump announces his candidacy. Unfortunately, on the night of the 17th Something very terrible happened. And that was the shootout was killed by a peacock. No, it was the shooting at the Charleston church. Oh, fuck me. The Dylann Roof went in and shot up the the the Emanuel African Methodist.

But I think that this is an important document and a very important piece of my investigation of how Alex went wrong. Because there is an interview with a guy at the end of this, that sort of I think is foundational to Alex's election 2016 behaviors radicalization, yes. But then at the same time, the rest of the episode, the body of the episode, very perfectly depicts how Alex Jones goes from ambivalence to false flag. And it's very interesting, False Flag Campaign that no thinking that the shooting was a false flag. Oh, fuck. So I'm going to lay it out ahead of time, what you're going to experience is at the start of the episode, Alex can't say one way or the other. Because he knows how racially charged it would be for him to say this is fake. Yeah. So he's like, I don't know. I can't say there have been a lot of people who have been false flags in the past. We know that Operation Gladio exists. All this stuff. He's just doing that like putting his toe in the water. It's like yeah, maybe Intel. He has an interview at the end of the episode with a preacher. A Reverend Childress, okay comes on, and basically just says, Come on, this is fake. And now that a black preacher has said that Alex is freed up to robustly bring the narrative.

And this is one of these events that I call a Rosetta Stone there are a lot of them that are now you could have you can take this event and look at every angle of our problems through it and learn a lot. Number one, I don't mean this sarcastically Dylann Roof who's now in police custody who walked around and posted to Facebook and places himself were wearing you know, South African apartheid attire, and patches are a fucking thing to drop our gone to medical school to be an abortionist, and then he can kill 10s of 1000s of black people in his career and be called a great member of society. And that's what the smart races do. Jakari Jackson and others have gone out and demonstrated and protested out front Planned Parenthood here in Austin, Texas and a bunch of death loving scum.

He was a 19 year old former football lineman, and he recounted a conversation that he had during the shooting, and this is a quote from him. I don't know why, but I just sat there looking at him as he came towards me. When he got within about five feet. He pointed one of his guns at me and just glared. I told him, Sir, you don't have to be doing this. He told me to shut the hell up. Then he asked me what my religion was. And I told him I was a Christian, a Baptist. He said, That sucks. And now that it was a stupid religion, needs replied, No, sir. It doesn't suck. It's a wonderful thing. God put me on this earth for a reason. I'm certain of that. ashbrooke fired several more rounds and yelled this religion is bullshit. And then he sat down and said, Fuck off and shot himself in the head. So, one good thing happened. Yeah, he was a crazy person. And investigators after the fact when they look went to his house, they discovered that he had virtually destroyed the interior of his house. Holes. Were bashed into the walls with crowbars. The toilet was filled with concrete and the fruit trees growing in the backyard had been poisoned. He is just not you is a completely crazy person.

The the point that I'm I want to make Unabomber point that I want to make still stands is that Ruby Ridge with with that Waco, you have the luxury of the general consciousness of thinking of those not as right wing terror attacks. Those are not the same thing as the way that we think about any kind of mass shooting with a Muslim involved with it. It's always a terror attack. White people can pull these right wing terror attacks, which are the most common form of terrorism in the United States. White people doing right wing murderers you That's the most common form of terrorism happens a bit. And even though he brings up these very similar right wing terror attacks, you don't associate the two together, because he gets to pull this stuff on Dylann Roof as being a guy trying to incite a race for a guy trying to do all these other things are possible false flag all of this shit. But it's never then brought back to the fact that it is this same right wing terrorism as a Timothy McVeigh. It's the same bullshit. But the luxury of white people murdering is you get to treat each one as if it's individual. Right. That is that that is privilege. I think that's the point that I'm trying to make. It took a long way to get there that's privileged

Like I think he was just how does that not have political leanings does, but not in the same way as Timothy McVeigh, like Timothy McVeigh was wrong about a lot of stuff. Right. But most of what motivated him was a feeling that most of the work of the government was oppressive to the individual. Yeah, that sort of thing.

It's him keeping up the room and a couple of the other clips that I'm going to play later, really bring into focus, how he thinks that Hillary Clinton is going to destroy the world. Now, in this April 5 2015 article a few months before, Here is a quote, this is just a direct quote from the article. But something strange has come over Larry, after six years of watching Barack Hussein Obama cower in the face of Islamist Nichols believes the family he spent two decades touring as cold blooded crooks might just be the only people who can save the country. Oh, for fuck say, quote, I'm not saying I like Hillary. You hear me? He said, defensively. I'm not saying I like Hillary Rodham Clinton. I'm not saying anything. I've said I take back, but God helped me. I'm going to have to stand up and tell conservative patriots. We have no choice, no choice, but to give Hillary her shot. Quote, I know she won't flinch. He continued. That's a mean SON OF A BITCH woman that can be laying over for people and say he paraphrased her now infamous response to hostile congressional questioning on the deaths of four Americans in Libya. What the hell difference does it make? He was against Clinton because of Whitewater. He's now voting for her because of Benghazi. Because she was so cold blooded about Benghazi. He thinks she'll be able to take out Muslims. This is a force this Saturday, two months before he's spouting this bullshit in a publication.

Larry is a person who lacks credibility, because he's clearly allied in public and on conservative radio shows in the past, right? I would say and lied about lying on those shows. Absolutely. I would say that he. Here's why it's difficult. For months before this, or three months before this.

The reason he supported her in that interview is that he believes that she's cutthroat cold blooded, and could destroy these Islamist right that he seems to be afraid of net, which she may have been. Well, but But if that is his rationalization for in that interview, supporting Hillary, yeah, it still does kind of match up philosophically with what he's saying in his interview, where he's saying that like, they're going to try and get Jeb Bush in. If there was an alternative that was the person who was going to be cutthroat with these Islamist that he imagines. I think he would be on their side as opposed to Hillary Trump. If Trump had existed as a logical, yeah, counterexample on June 18. Which doesn't. Exactly so that like that part doesn't seem to me to be a logical contradiction. It does.

Alex started this show. Unaware of what to do about the Charleston shooting? Yes, he ambivalently wandered around and accidentally, probably intentionally but also accidentally spouted a bunch of incredibly racist ideas. Yes, he wound it around until he had a African American preacher on the show who went way further than him and gave him permission and cover to be like, Oh, no, it is all about guns. It's all Yeah.
