The Washington congressman, who criticized President Bush while visiting Baghdad last year has questioned the timing of the capture of deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat from Washington State hold a Seattle radio station Monday. The US military could have found Saddam a long time ago. Go they wanted to ask him he thought the weekend capture was time to help Bush McDermott chuckled and said, yeah. Oh, yeah. The Democratic Congressman went on to say there's too much by happenstance for it to be just a coincidental thing. And interviewed by Dave Ross asked again, if he meant to imply that Bush administration time the capture for political reasons McDermott said, I don't know that it was definitely planned on the weekend. But I know they've been in contact with people all along who knew basically where he was it was just a matter of time. He'll they find him.

He was supposedly videotaped a month after the globalist took over Iraq running around without a beard just with his mustache. So that's three and a half months. How did he grow that huge beard? And why is the beard gray right up to his temples? Because folks, I've seen a million beard so if you if somebody's going to have gray, solid gray up to their temples, and it's not gonna turn black suddenly at the temple, and right up to the top of his head.

I understand you could make a mistake, but it's not a coincidence that Alex consistently makes this exact same error reporting false versions of headlines in just such a way that confirm his narrative. That's, it's, it's not a mistake. Also, Henri Paul was not with MI six, and you should take note of the weaselly way Paul is conveying this information, saying it's basically confirmed means that it's not Yeah, but he's trying to get across to the audience that it is confirmed. A former mi six agent named Richard Tomlinson had said that he'd seen files that showed that there was an MI six informant who worked in security at the Ritz hotel. He never specified that this was Paul and it's never been corroborated. The inquest into these theories even says, quote, Richard Tomlinson accepted that some of this detailed may be knowledge he subsequently obtained from the media that he has mixed with his own recollection.
