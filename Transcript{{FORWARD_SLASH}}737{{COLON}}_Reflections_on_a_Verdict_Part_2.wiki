I mean, there were some family members that, you know, every time their child's name, for example, was mentioned, in court, they, you know, they would be very emotional about that, and, and then hearing each other's stories. I mean, they, you know, sometimes there were spouses who, you know, they didn't know that what the other one had gone through, you know, they didn't they hadn't heard that exact story told in that exact way, or they hadn't heard, you know, another relative story themselves. So, you know, you could really see it you know, how much just grief and you know, and how, what a revelation, some of this was even to them. And, and they were really there for each other.

So you just kind of don't realize that, yeah, of course, they wouldn't have just sat down in a group and gone through each individual story to each other.

And then the other thing, and I noticed this when I was writing my book, memories are faulty, particularly when people have gone through a big trauma. They, they, you know, can't remember everything. And this has been, you know, just about a decade. So, you know, I think them working on those recollections and, and then replaying them, you know, there were things that I think they that some people in the room hadn't know, hadn't really remembered, although they may have known it at the time.

    | text      = Yeah. So they had a number of questions. And so every time they'd ask a question, you try to game, you know, what does that mean? You know, at one point they asked to hear the testimony again, of William Sherlach, who's a wife, Mary Sherlach was the school psychologist who died at Sandy Hook. And there was this, you know, thought in the room? Well, okay. Let's think, his name appears on the bottom of the jury verdict form. So does that mean they're nearing the end? Yeah. All right, try and, you know, figure it all out. And kind of game through it to see, well, what does that mean? And one question, in particular, that the jury asked was this thing where they said, What does it mean, there's this kind of archaic language in the law, in these sorts of cases. And it's what does it, you know, the instruction to the jury is, try to put the plaintiff back into the position when you, you know, levy these damages, try to put them back into position they were before the harm occurred. And, you know, that works for things like, you know, a broken contract. So, you know, you can say, well, here's the income you would have had, if that person hadn't broken, illegally broken the contract or, you know, a personal injury, you know, you're paying for hospitalization, and maybe special care and things like that. But when it comes to defamation, and you know, reputational damage and things like that, and reputational damage to someone who has lost someone in this way, how do you ever get them back to where they started? You know, that's, it becomes almost a philosophical question. So yeah, it's a, you know, it was just, you know, everyone was thinking, what are they thinking when they're asking that question? Are they thinking, you know, no amount of money? Are they thinking any amount of money, you know, how, how are they grappling with that? So, so that was kind of a thing you know everybody was wondering, you know, what, what do they you know, what's going on inside that room where only the six member panel is meeting?

And obviously, it was just, you know, that was the first name and then "et al." meant, rather than writing out every single name, right, but everybody, everybody went, Oh, I know, they they must be thinking that if the name is first, maybe there was more injury to them.

I mean, they were they were really into this, and, and, you know, they were very engaged. And I noticed a lot, you know, there would be different testimony, and, you know, you they would be, you know, wiping their tears away, you know, kind of crying a little bit, kind of when Jones testified, you know, a lot of frowns and a lot of shaking of their heads.

And so Norm said, I think, you know, it's probably best instead I'm, and also I think a strategic play, there's some lawyers who are commenting on Twitter who are more knowledgeable and you know, on the on the legal strategy and and they were saying it's favorable to his client if Norm would decline to do the cross like that and instead call his own client as the defense witness. So he reserved the right to do that. They made a deal with the families' lawyers where they would have the right to cross if he if Norm called him and he came back. And so Norm said, he's not going to testify today. He's going to come back next week. And I will call him as a witness.

    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson
    | timestamp = 00:51:36.000
    | text      = Yeah. Yeah. I, I was a little surprised at that, because some of his, you know, messaging to the media in, you know, the years leading up to the trial was sort of, well, these families think that they'll, they'll, you know, that they won't be examined themselves? Well, they will be and, you know, he had a lot of, well, we know, he had a lot of their personal records, and health records and things like that. And the reason we know that is, of course, they were wrongly transmitted to the attorneys in Texas. And, you know, he had to come up for a hearing on that, because that shouldn't have been done. So, you know, but once the families were on the stand and testifying as to what they'd been through, he had very little to say, uh, he, he didn't, you know, Robbie Parker and what Robbie has endured in this case, or over the years from Alex Jones, where he played that, you know, opening few seconds of Robbie Parker's press conference, the night after his daughter, Emilie was killed at Sandy Hook, over and over and over again for years. So Robbie was really at the center of this case, and Alissa Parker, Emilie's mom also testified. And she's not a plaintiff, but the two of them just portray, you know, just painted this nightmare of, you know, torment and death threats and people knowing where they lived, and a man confronting Robbie, you know, four years after the shooting on the street in Seattle, and all of these things. And Norm did have, did not have a single question for either one of them. Which was really pretty surprising. But then again, this is testimony so powerful that you wonder, really, what is there to say,

    | timestamp = 00:54:12.000
    | text      = Or politics. yeah, exactly. Subtly trying to inject politics. And that was against the rules. The judge had said, you cannot talk about electoral politics. You can't talk about political figures. You can't discuss Jones's finances, because we remember in, in Austin in August, you know, he tried to say wrongly that he was bankrupt, and that 2 million would be more than he could, you know, just about all or more than he could handle in terms of a verdict, you know, so on and so on. So all of that was sort of off the table. But, you know, lawyers try to, you know, get around that to in to then, you know, in presenting their cases. And so, you know, a couple of times in mentioning some of the families' charities, you know, he was talking about well, is, and basically, Isn't this about gun violence? Isn't this about gun control? And isn't this about politics? You know, that, didn't you? Uh, well, he mentioned this when the Wheelers testified because Francine Wheeler, about I can't remember how long after the shooting a month or two, after the shooting, delivered President Obama's radio address on a Saturday, and this was when the families were pushing for expanded background checks. And that legislation wound up failing. But as part of that effort, she delivered the radio address and Norm brought that up. So it's a way to get both guns and politics, you know, back into the the jury's minds. And I think the calculus there may have been, that there would have been some people on the jury who might have been sympathetic to that argument that, okay, so this was, there was a political aspect here or something like that. But I think as these stories mounted, and as, you know, just the sort of horror of what some of these people had endured, became more and more apparent, I think, you know, Norm wisely decided that this wouldn't be worth it. But you know, st trying to say, Oh, well, you voted for Hillary Clinton, is not going to cut it. When you have jurors weeping at the idea that, you know, people who had just lost their loved ones were getting death threats, rape threats, people threatening to dig up their murdered children, and, you know, talking about defiling their graves, you know, saying, oh, wasn't this all about gun control? Just sort of pales as an argument.

The notion of, you know, political ideas, while distracting...

Just to hear that day after day, what, you know, what these poor people had gone through and, and to kind of like, just, you know, the jury was watching them in the courtroom day after day, you know, just stoic and pulled together and consoling each other. And it was extremely powerful. And I think that's another reason that Alex Jones didn't return to the courtroom because we saw what happened when Scarlett Lewis through an accident of timing wound up, you know, confronting him and for 90 minutes addressing the answer to every question directly at Alex Jones and asking him, you know, why are you doing this and truth is so important to our society. Truth is the bedrock on which our democracy rests, you say you're concerned about the country, and you're spreading things like this? What, what's wrong with you, basically, and I think, at all costs, I mean, having watched him literally sweat through his shirt while she was talking to him, I think the idea of sitting in front of 15 plaintiffs just, I don't think he could do it.

So I really wanted to, so one of the things that Chris Mattei, one of the lawyers for the families, mentioned was and I just found myself actually even in the moment saying, I wonder what Dan and Jordan would think about this? He was saying that one of the reasons that he thinks Jones didn't testify more is that it's really important to him to be on the outside, calling this all a sham, because he thinks that the more time he would have spent in the courtroom, and I don't want to, I don't want to misstate what his message but I think this was, you know, pretty close to what he was saying. Any as, close as he got to this, if he got close to this process, that it would sort of expose him as this guy who's just a huckster and selling products, and doing it, you know, on the backs of these people, and lying about this and having to acknowledge that he had been lying about this for years, that that would damage him with his audience. And I and I said to Chris at the time, I don't know, because his audience seems to sort of accommodate a lot of what he says or changes in, you know, changes in his story or whatever.

And if only he could defend himself. If only he could say the name Trump and Hillary, then everything would be fine. right. Like I think that I think that what Mattei is saying make sense. And to the outside world, I think he would be exposed as a as a liar and a con man and all this, but that that audience, they have so many opportunities to realize this outside the courtroom.

And, you know, he himself and this was a point I made in the story I wrote about the verdict. You know, he has been a part of most of the highest profile, viral lies over the decades since Sandy Hook, you know, whether you're talking about Pizzagate, or you know, Coronavirus myths and anti vax stuff. And, you know, the great replacement theory that drove the violence in Charlottesville, and certainly the 2020 election conspiracy theories that led to the violence at the Capitol on January 6th. So, you know, I think that their sense was by speaking about what happened to them, and how this all got started, and how long it's lasted, they were speaking to that. And, you know, and really trying to help, you know, claiming, you know, not only claiming their their, you know, their their story and saying, you know, this is that, as Robbie put it, you know, in the press conference afterwards, you know, he found his voice. He was silent about this for so long because he didn't want the abuse to get worse. He was really worried about the safety of his family. And, and, you know, he he finally got to a point when he saw that, you know, Parkland parents were receiving the same kind of abuse. And that just horrible statistic that today, nearly 20% of Americans believe that every high profile mass shooting is a plot by the government. Yeah, and is fake. You know, they were able to sort of say, Hey, this is something really serious that isn't not only impacting us, this is not a one off, this, we were the, you know, a foundational story and what is now a phenomenon, and the fact that they were able to raise that I think was was really satisfying to them. And, and we owe them our gratitude for that, because as you could see from watching the proceedings, it did not come easily for them to you know, it was extremely painful for them to, to, you know, raise that alarm, and and, you know, and relay and recall what had happened. So, yeah, so I think in that sense, you know, and again, sticking with what Robbie was saying, afterwards, you know, that they stood, they sat there, they went through it, they told the truth, and everybody on that stand, and this is these are Robbie's words, not mine. Everybody on that stand, told the truth, except for one person. yeah. And you know, and I think that that is

But by doing this, the trial itself, to me kind of reinforces just how bad Alex is, without allowing Alex to poison people's minds with all of the other shit with all the politics and the emotional bullshit, all the things that can get them angry and distract them. Without that, there is no misinformation a reasonable group of people, and you know, there were Republicans on the jury, a reasonable group of people will look at that shit and go, that is a monster. It is only by Alex Jones's ability to inject those things that we get to where Alex Jones is in trial. You know what I'm saying?

I mean, the fact that, that politics, it's not about politics, as we've seen, you know, there have been people whose lives have been destroyed by online disinformation and just abuse. You know, so many of them, and, you know, they're on all, you know, they're across the political spectrum, and for reasons that, you know, have everything and nothing to do with politics.

He's very theatrical. He's fun to watch. But at the same time, he always had those ties to these sort of far right extremists like Stuart Rhodes from the Oathkeepers. And, you know, I mean, his first the first demonstration of how persuasive he could be was when he raised $90,000 to rebuild the Branch Davidian church after the Waco siege. yeah.

And that's because it was there. It wasn't like he invented some brand new thing that that brought everybody to something it was that there's a crack, and he just hammered away at it until he got his own space.
