But us being down in Texas for like two weeks was it felt like an endurance trial? Yeah, it was excruciating. i And this trial in particular was, there were so many really moving difficult stories from these family members. I just, I feel like I feel like I would collapse. Yeah.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson

    | text      = Yeah, I mean, the families were the ones I really was thinking of, because, you know, once in a while, you know, the group would be larger or smaller, but I would say for the most part, the families attended just about every day of the trial, and you could really see the toll that it was taking on them. I mean, there were some family members that, you know, every time their child's name, for example, was mentioned, in court, they, you know, they would be very emotional about that, and, and then hearing each other's stories. I mean, they, you know, sometimes there were spouses who, you know, they didn't know that what the other one had gone through, you know, they didn't they hadn't heard that exact story told in that exact way, or they hadn't heard, you know, another relative story themselves. So, you know, you could really see it You know, how much just grief and you know, and how, what a revelation, some of this was even to them. And, and they were really there for each other. I mean, they, they all sat together, they all consult each other, they all kind of, you know, spent time together. And that was,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 10:21
    | text      = yeah, that is a really, really interesting thing that I I hadn't thought of, and I imagine most people hadn't thought of because, you know, despite our desire to kind of view everybody individually, in this case, obviously, there is still that element of, they're all sitting there with a shared event in their lives. So you just kind of don't realize that, yeah, of course, they wouldn't have just sat down in a group and gone through each individual story to each other.

I'm sure you guys notice that. Could you not? Yeah, yeah. And then the other thing, and I noticed this, when I was writing my book, memories are faulty, particularly when people have gone through a big trauma. They, they, you know, can't remember everything. And this has been, you know, just about a decade. So, you know, I think them working on those recollections and, and then replaying them, you know, there were things that I think they that some people in the room hadn't know, hadn't really remembered, although they may have noted at the time,

    | text      = came to the end of the trial last week, on Wednesday, I guess the verdict was read on Wednesday. But the actual end of the arguments was the week, the end of the week prior, right. And so one of the things that I was wondering, was, How did things feel as time went on? And the jury was deliberating?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson
    | timestamp = 12:46
    | text      = Yeah. So they had a number of questions. And so every time they'd ask a question, you try to game, you know, what does that mean? You know, one more, they asked to hear the testimony again, of William Sherlock, who's a wife, Mary, Sherlock was the school psychologist who died at Sandy Hook. And there was this, you know, thought in the room? Well, okay. Let's think his name appears on the bottom of the jury verdict form. So does that mean they're nearing the end? Yeah. All right, try and, you know, figure it all out. And kind of game through it to see, well, what does that mean? And one question, in particular, that the jury asked was this thing where they said, What does it mean, there's this kind of archaic language in the law, in these sorts of cases. And it's what does it, you know, the instruction to the jury is, try to put the plaintiff back into the position when you, you know, levy these damages, try to put them back into position they were before the harm occurred. And, you know, that works for things like, you know, a broken contract. So, you know, you can say, well, here's the income you would have had, if that person hadn't broken, illegally broken the contract or, you know, a personal injury, you know, you're paying for hospitalization, and maybe special care and things like that. But when it comes to defamation, and you know, reputational damage and things like that, and reputational damage to someone who has lost someone in this way, how do you ever get them back to where they started? You know, that's, it becomes almost a philosophical question. So yeah, it's a, you know, it was just, you know, everyone was thinking, what are they thinking when they're asking that question? Are they thinking, you know, that no amount of money are they thinking any amount of money, you know, how, how are they grappling with that? So, so that was kind of a Thank you. Everybody was wondering, you know, what, what do they you know, what's going on inside that room where only the six member panel is meeting? Yeah,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 15:08
    | text      = I remember the one question that stuck with me from them is the one where they asked why was the why was Lafferty the first name? And obviously, it was just, you know, that was the first name and then at all meant, rather than writing out every single name, right, but everybody, everybody went, Oh, I know, they they must be thinking that if the name is first, maybe there was more injury to them. You know, everybody had to have had that same thought. Right?

    | text      = Yep. Not even the definition of at all. Yeah, no, they were very thorough. They, they were extremely diligent. You got the sense that, you know, as the judge was noting, during the trial, they were showing up early every day. They were taking notes. I mean, they were they were really into this, and, and, you know, they were very engaged. And I noticed a lot, you know, there would be different testimony, and, you know, you they would be, you know, wiping their tears away, you know, kind of crying a little bit, kind of when Jones testified, you know, a lot of frowns and a lot of shaking of their heads. And that, you know, was really interesting, because after that I'm Norm Pattis told me he thought Jones did well in his testimony, and I was thinking defined well.

So norm would have, you know, had a chance to examine, you know, his own client has the defendant and he declined and he said so we will assume given what we said earlier about Alex calling all the shots so Alex didn't want to testify a second day can't falter. And so norm set, I think, you know, it's probably best instead I am. And also I think strategic play, there's some lawyers who are commenting on Twitter who are more knowledgeable and you know, on the on the legal strategy and and they were saying it's favorable to his client if norm would declined to do the cross like that and instead call his own client as the defense witness. So he reserved the right to do that. They made a deal with the family's lawyers where they would have the right to cross if he if norm called him and he came back. And so Norm said, he's not going to testify today. He's going to come back next week. And I will call him as a witness. And this is agreeable to the family's lawyers, and then they will have another crack at him, basically. And he and what he said was, that'll lower the temperature in the room. You know, I think it will be better. So I interpreted that. And having seen the jurors reactions to Jones's testimony the day prior, I interpreted that, as you know, Norm says, he's his client has damaged himself so much that you might want to give the jury a break something to that effect, which I

So what after the recess, he came back, it was clear that, you know, Jones had seen this, called it to his attention, or someone at Infowars, but maybe Jones. And so he came back, and he was just really angry. And he was saying, I don't know why, you know, Elizabeth Williamson of The New York Times is covering this. She's written a book about this. And, you know, she shouldn't be on his court room, and she how anyone could have interpreted what I said, as he's damaged, and the judge cut him off. And she was like, we're not doing this here. That's not what this trial is about, you know, I've already told, you know, stop talking over me something like that. And, and so he tried again, and she stopped him. And then that was that. And I thought, Oh, if he's calling me out for something, I better see what the problem is, you know. So I followed him out of the courtroom. And when we got in the hallway, I turned on my recorder on my phone, because I wanted to hear what he had to say. And he was like, I'm not talking to you. And I said, Well, are you talking to you? So you just wanted to say that in front of the, you know, so my alternative to think if you have a problem with something I've written, I want to hear you out?

The second week, he pulled back and by the third week, he was like, I'm not gonna cross examine anybody. I'm just gonna say go for it, you know?

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson
    | timestamp = 51:36
    | text      = Yeah. Yeah. I, I was a little surprised at that, because some of his, you know, messaging to the media in, you know, the years leading up to the trial was sort of, well, these families think that though, though, you know, that they won't be examined themselves? Well, they will be and, you know, he had a lot of, well, we know, he had a lot of their personal records, and health records and things like that. And the reason we know that is, of course, they were wrongly transmitted to the attorneys in Texas. And, you know, he had to come up for a hearing on that, because that shouldn't have been done. So, you know, but once the families were on the stand and testifying as to what they'd been through, he had very little to say, uh, he, he didn't, you know, Robbie Parker and what Robbie has endured in this case, or over the years from Alex Jones, where he played that, you know, opening few seconds of Robbie Parker's press conference, the night after his daughter, Emily was killed at Sandy Hook over and over and over again for years. So Robbie was really at the center of this case, and Alyssa Parker, Emily's mom also testified. And she's not a plaintiff, but the two of them just portray, you know, just painted this nightmare of, you know, torment and death threats and people knowing where they lived, and a man confronting Robbie, you know, four years after the shooting on the street and Seattle, and all of these things. And norm did have did not have a single question for either one of them. Which was really pretty surprising. But then again, this is testimony so powerful that you wonder, really, what is there to say,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 53:36
    | text      = you can only kind of make it worse for yourself. Yeah, I think Yeah. I think that his crossing that he did do with a couple of the plaintiffs was just about like, you have a charity. Suspicious? Yeah. Yeah.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 54:02

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson
    | timestamp = 54:12
    | text      = Yeah, exactly. Trying to inject politics. And that was against the rules. The judge had said, you cannot talk about electoral politics. You can't talk about political figures. You can't discuss Jones's finances, because we remember in, in Austin in August, you know, he tried to say wrongly that he was bankrupt, and that 2 million would be more than he could, you know, just about all or more than he could handle in terms of a verdict, you know, so on and so on. So all of that was sort of off the table. But, you know, lawyers try to, you know, get around that to independence, you know, in presenting their cases. And so, you know, a couple of times in mentioning some of the families charities, you know, he was talking about well, is And basically, isn't this about gun violence? Isn't this about gun control? And isn't this about politics? You know, that, didn't you? Uh, well, he mentioned this when the Wheelers testified because Francine Wheeler, about I can't remember how long after the shooting a month or two, after the shooting, delivered President Obama's radio address on a Saturday, and this was when the families were pushing for expanded background checks. And that legislation wound up failing. But as part of that effort, she delivered the radio address and Norm brought that up. So it's a way to get both guns and politics, you know, back into the the jury's minds. And I think the calculus, there may have been, that there would have been some people on the jury who might have been sympathetic to that argument that, okay, so this was there was a political aspect here or something like that. But I think as these stories mounted, and as, you know, just the sort of horror of what some of these people had endured, became more and more apparent. I think, you know, Nora wisely decided that this wouldn't be worth it. But you know, st trying to say, Oh, well, you voted for Hillary Clinton is not going to cut it. When you have jurors weeping at the idea that, you know, people who had just lost their loved ones were getting death threats, rape threats, people threatening to dig up their murdered children, and, you know, talking about defiling their graves, you know, saying, oh, wasn't this all about gun control? Just sort of pills as an argument.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 56:45
    | text      = Yeah, yeah. And I think that, you know, whatever you can inject into that is kind of useless once. The understanding of the damage being the, like, sort of making it so you can't properly grieve and reopening wounds over and over and over and over and over again, the notion of, you know, political ideas, while distracting, right? Probably not that helpful. Yeah. No,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson

    | text      = yeah, it was just, it was just too powerful and too awful, you know, that. Just to hear that day after day, what, you know, what these poor people had gone through and, and the kind of like, just, you know, the jury was watching them in the courtroom day after day, you know, just stoic and pulled together and consoling each other. And it was extremely powerful. And I think that's another reason that Alex Jones didn't return to the courtroom because we saw what happened when Scarlett Lewis through an accident of timing wound up know, confronting him and for 90 minutes addressing the answer to every question directly at Alex Jones and asking him, you know, why are you doing this and truth is so important to our society. Truth is the bedrock on which our democracy rests, you say you're concerned about the country, and you're spreading things like this? What, what's wrong with you, basically, and I think, at all costs, I mean, having watched him literally sweat through his shirt while she was talking to him, I think the idea of sitting in front of 15 plaintiffs just I don't think he could do it. I really don't. I think he was afraid.

So I really wanted to so one of the things that Chris Mattie, one of the lawyers for the families mentioned was and I just found myself actually even in the moment it's like, I want to get down in Georgia. Think about this. He was saying that one of the reasons that he thinks Jones didn't testify more is that it's really important to him to be on the outside calling this all a sham, because he thinks that the more time you would have spent in the courtroom and I don't want to, I don't want to miss misstate what his message but I think this was, you know, pretty close to what he was saying. Any as close as he got to this, if he got close to this process, that it would sort of expose him as this guy who's just a huckster and selling products, and doing it, you know, on the backs of these people, and lying about this and having to acknowledge that he had been lying about this for years, that that would damage him with his audience.

So it sounds like yeah, that was a sort of debunking argument that, you know, something that Lenny Posner, who really began this whole effort to call Alex Jones to account, you know, learned early on that debunking doesn't really work. We've learned the idea of like, exposing, oh, Alex Jones will be exposed, as you know, a person who lies and sells products on the back of tragedy, etc. It's sort of in a way, it reminded me of, you know, how difficult it is to talk someone out of a conspiracy theory that they have already fully embraced that, you know, his audience is, as you said, Dan, you know, captive they, they, they're in so they have their choices to accommodate, but to repudiate him, I think, I don't know what that would take.

But at the same time, there's still a road to travel, there's still the looming notion of appeals that are still, you know, I mean, I don't think an appeal is going to work.

So without, you know, betraying any individual confidences, I think just and you know, and I, you know, I don't like to speak for the families as a group, because that's just not right. Yeah. What I yeah, what I, from what I gathered, first of all, a gigantic exhale in the room, you know, just a sense of, wow, you know, we, we kind of took back our story, you know, we we, we were able to tell the world what happened, we were able to explain by explaining what happened, we were able to explain the dangers here of this sort of culture of disinformation and lies for profit. And, you know, and explain that this is a phenomenon that's not confined to to Alex Jones, and has really in the decades since Sandy Hook, occurred again and again. And, you know, he himself and this was a point I made in the story I wrote about the verdict. You know, he has been a part of most of the highest profile, viral lies over the decades since Sandy Hook, you know, whether you're talking about pizza gate, or you know, Coronavirus myths and anti Vax stuff. And, you know, the great replacement theory that drove the violence in Charlottesville, and certainly the 2020 election conspiracy theories that led to the violence at the Capitol on January 6. So, you know, I think that their sense was by speaking about what happened to them, and how this all got started, and how long it's lasted. They were speaking to that. And, you know, and really trying to help, you know, claiming, you know, not only claiming their their, you know, their their story and saying, you know, this is that, as Robbie put it, you know, in the press conference afterwards, yeah, he found his voice. He was silent about this for so long because he didn't want the abuse to get worse. He was really worried about the safety of his family. And, and, you know, he he finally got to a point when he saw that, you know, Parkland parents were receiving the same kind of abuse. And that just horrible statistic that Today, nearly 20% of Americans believe that every high profile mass shooting is a plot by the government. Yeah, and it's fake. You know, they were able to sort of say, Hey, this is something really serious that isn't not only impacting us, this is not a one off this, we were the, you know, a foundational story and what is now a phenomenon, and the fact that they were able to raise that I think was was really satisfying to them. And, and we owe them our gratitude for that, because as you could see from watching the proceedings, it did not come easily for them to you know, it was extremely painful for them to, to, you know, raise that alarm, and and, you know, and relay and recall what had happened. So, yeah, so I think in that sense, you know, and again, sticking with what Robbie was saying, afterwards, you know, that they stood, they sat there, they went through it, they told the truth, and everybody on that stand, and this is these are Robbie's words, not mine. Everybody on that stand, told the truth, except for one person. Yeah. And you know, and I think that that value, yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I think about her

But by doing this, the trial itself, to me kind of reinforces just how bad Alex is, without allowing Alex to poison people's minds with all of the other shed with all the politics and the emotional bullshit, all the things that can get them mangry and distract them. Without that. There is no misinformation a reasonable group of people. And you know, there were Republicans on the jury, the reasonable group of people will look at that shit and go, that is a monster. It is only by Alex Jones's ability to inject those things that we get to where Alex Jones is in trial. You know what I'm saying? Yeah,

Yeah, you know, there's, there's these, there's so many stories that end up going never heard. Yeah.

And, and, yeah, and, you know, you're so right. I mean, the fact that, that politics, it's not about politics, as we've seen, you know, there have been people whose lives have been destroyed by online disinformation and just abuse. You so many of them, and, you know, they're on all, you know, they're across the political spectrum, and for reasons that, you know, have everything and nothing to do with politics.
