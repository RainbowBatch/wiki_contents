Last week, Alex pickle, Alex Jones last week, did a lot of nonsense. And I don't want to talk about most of it. He spent almost the entire week of course, Muslim baiting because that's our bread and butter. That's the way we do it. But then on top of that he spent a disproportionate amount of time doing interviews with Dr. Group about his supplements love doctor group and how important this stuff is. And you know, right that's salesmanship it's kind of boring, whatever. But then the rest of the time was drumming up nuclear war against North Korea.

    | text      = it's a ghost. But it's a ghost. Yes, exactly. So I don't want to talk about Alex Jones as well. We can talk about it briefly. But I don't want to cover his perspective on Trump's attack in Syria, because it's kind of boring and very predictable. Yeah, and it's not really all that entertaining, right? Like we could break down a lot of lies contained therein. But the problem with a lot of his lies is in this instance, they're all completely undisputable. Right? So it's not really all that like, when we talk about the Dennis Montgomery CIA whistleblower thing that we covered a couple episodes back, it's very disprovable, we can go through I can research stuff and we can figure out okay, this is what's going on blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right. In the case of his, his narrative about Syria, it's also speculative and based on, you know, like, what, what's going on here is that Trump did this as a sort of way of signaling to the Chinese A leader who was here, the commune, Cami Chinese leader was here that Jing ping, oh, he doesn't want to go with names. Okay, he is because he could definitely not pronounce Xi Jinping.

But he's like, that's a signal to him that he's, you know, he's strong, and he's ready to attack at any minute. It's going to help with the negotiations. And then his further argument is that, you know, this is probably, Trump and Putin got together and talked, and they were saying, hey, why don't I do this symbolic attack on Syria, which it was, and I'll tell you ahead of time, and you know what she did, which, you know, you won't end up killing anybody or anything like that.

But so his perspective is that Trump and Putin got together and had this conversation like we're gonna do this attack, because then the media will get off our back about this fake Russian connection, which they did. And then we can have conversations publicly, and we can talk and we can work this out and we can reach they talked,

And like, I really hate the idea that Alex thinks that these gas attacks are a false flag. It's really boring. To cover every time he says something's a false flag. After the Boston bombing, after Sandy Hook, false flag, everything in the Colorado shooter in the movie theater, false flag, everything back shooter false flag. Well, no, that was a botched false flag. Because it was because it wasn't a Muslim. Do you still doesn't recognize that fair enough. But I just don't I don't mind 11

And I think we need to flesh out more because Alex is proving me right. That whenever you don't deal with Alex Jones, on his turf, and when you take him out of context, what you were doing is playing into his hands. Yeah. And if you want to pretend that you're against him, and you like, if you want to expose what he's saying, and you play that game, you're failing. You're just by definition. I agree. And it's really bothersome.

They are part of the Democratic Party, basically. Yeah. And all this stuff about George Soros funding them and it's evil. That stuff. bumpers. bumpers, yeah, that's bananas. But they are a wing of the Democratic Party. Essentially, they, you know, their mission statement is to expose and document right wing pundits. Yeah. So they have O'Reilly, they have Hannity, they have Alex Jones, on their website, and they document weird fucking things. They say, Okay, I have never actually been to their website. It's not great. That's fine. I think that what you have described, what they do is perfect. And they feed the outrage machine. Yes. Where you post this video, and everyone gets mad at Alex Jones. And then they think he's a joke, and then they forget. And then you wait a while, and maybe he says something else. That's scandalous. And then you move on and what have you. This is a failure of a game. Now, just to remind everyone, last week, Media Matters put out a clip from Alex Jones's broadcast of March 30th. That we discussed. Yes. We discussed for maybe too long.

If you're covering this clip to take it out of the context of the bigger picture. Alex would make the same argument. I'm making the other argument. We have the same idea. Taking Alex Jones out of context is wrong. Alex thinks it's because the context defends him. I think it's because the context makes him worse, way worse.

Yeah, whenever you do these things, and you take them out of context, like the Stephen Colbert thing when Stephen Colbert played those clips, Alex can point out you did edit that you edited my audio. Whenever they did that on Fox News. When Megan Kelly played that thing about pizza gate, they did edit Alex's audio.

And we've shown repeatedly that his own literacy of the articles that he discusses is still in question. So I did some research into the idea of what age literacy develops and things like that. Usually it's about six. But child psychology, the ability to think abstractly, doesn't usually develop until about the age of 1111 is kind of on the downside of it. Interesting. So the if you don't know the ability to think abstractly is basically understanding symbolism and metaphor, the idea of dealing with texts critically, using critical thinking, understanding argumentation, those sorts of things. Usually aren't around until you're about in like fifth grade or so. Okay, so up till that point, most of education is nurturing what's there and being really simple with like, building a base? Yeah.
