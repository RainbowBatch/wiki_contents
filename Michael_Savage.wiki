'''Michael Savage''' is an American conservative talk radio host who has infrequently appeared on [[InfoWars]] as a guest. Savage has a different brand than [[Alex Jones]]]], but has pushed some very hardcore stuff, including [[Covid-19]] denial-ism and a bunch of [[Great Replacement Theory]]-style racism.

Savage likes to skirt the line of pretending to be a doctor, but it's worth noting that his most relevant degree is in "nutritional ethnomedicine". He's consistently advocated ineffective and harmful woo like homeopathy while disparaging actual medicine like vaccines. He also got fired by by MSNBC one time for saying this to a caller after asking if they were a "sodomite":

<blockquote>Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig. How's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage. You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now, do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another- put another sodomite on ... no more calls? I don't care about these bums, they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.</blockquote>
