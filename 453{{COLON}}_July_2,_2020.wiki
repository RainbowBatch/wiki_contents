Today, Dan and Jordan take an exhaustive look at two shows [[Alex Jones]] recorded on July 2nd. In his morning show, Alex rambles about cyborgs and puts off covering big news about the arrest of [[Ghislaine Maxwell]]. To make up for not getting to it on his normal show, Alex returns to air in the evening and tries to cover the big news of the day, with depressing results.

==Detailed Show Notes==

Dan and Jordan discuss two shows that Alex Jones recorded on July 2, one in the daytime, and one in the depressing nighttime hours.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/research/2020/7/19/episode-453-july-2-2020 Episode 453: July 2, 2020]</ref>

Topics covered include:

*Alex claims that he's been covering Jefferey Epstein for 15 years. There is no evidence of that on Infowars' website, nor on his mirror site, Prison Planet.

[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1595218479899-Z46PF38RH7KLDYH27GLR/NoEpsteinOnPrisonPlanet.JPG|thumb|none]]

*Alex has absolutely no idea how to pronounce Ghislaine Maxwell's name.
*Alex pretends that the removal of Geoffrey Berman, attorney at the Southern District of NY, was due to Berman not allowing the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell to happen. No evidence for this is provided, and it seems more likely that he was removed because he was investigating Trump's associates.
*Alex interviews a guy named Larry Gaiters, who claims that various words have completely made up roots. He says that "negro" comes from the Greek word "necro" ([https://www.etymonline.com/word/negro it does not]) and that the word media comes from the Hebrew word for witches.
*Alex misrepresents [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/ an Atlantic article from May] about Covid test reporting inconsistencies. He claims that numbers are all just being made up, but this article is about how there were some states that were reporting negative results to viral and antibody tests as a single figure, which makes the data difficult to interpret. This was brought up, and corrected.
*Alex [https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408.pdf lies about a study] about how cities that had Black Lives Matter protests in them actually saw increased social distancing behavior, and it may have helped decrease transmission. Alex hasn't read the study, and is just making up what it says.
*Alex realized that he did a bad job on his regular show, so he returns in the evening to do a 2 hour special emergency report about Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest. He seems very drunk, says nothing meaningful, rants about his ex-wife, almost starts crying a few times, and bails with half an hour left in the planned show. It was an absolutely embarrassing and childish display, but far from the worst Alex has been on air.
