Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened on the April 25 episode of The Alex Jones Show. The day before, Chobani yogurt announced that they were suing InfoWars for defamation, so this episode is Alex's very ill-advised response to that news. Watch as he lies about the facts of the case and says many things he can't take back and will be used against him in court.
