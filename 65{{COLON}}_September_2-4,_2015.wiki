Today, Dan tells Jordan about the 10th installment of his investigation into what happened in 2015 to make Alex Jones join up with Team Trump. This segment has very little to do with Trump, but is a nicely encapsulated tale of Alex being very stupid about race, getting his comeuppance, and completely ignoring being shown to be wrong.

Also, Dan complains about that Bon Iver/Alex Jones meme.
