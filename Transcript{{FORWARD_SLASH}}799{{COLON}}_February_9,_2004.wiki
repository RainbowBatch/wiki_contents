You can't do that. In one instance, it was two high school students who are going home from a football game. In the most recent case, he illegally detained two Salvadorian immigrants who he assaulted, they successfully sued him and were awarded his ranch in lieu of a monetary payment. Nice. We talked about that case recently, because another guy from the organization Casey is a part of was a guest. That was a guy named Jack foot from the group ranch rescue. Right?

Okay, that was according to reporting at that time. There were a couple of dozen fans that were chanting Osama at the US team after they lost to Mexico. That was the next match that happens like in a few days. Sure. Sure, sure. Most of the rest of the audience was just booing the US team since the US team had beat Mexico in the 2002.

So Bush was absolutely not in favor of blanket amnesty and nothing he ever did well in office came close to such a policy. white nationalists call any kind of making immigration or pleading refugee status the same as blanket amnesty, because in reality, they want no non white immigration. Alex is essentially on the same page as that. But his public brand doesn't really allow him to argue that way. So this is what you get. Neither Mexico's government nor a majority of their population wants to kill white people. I have not seen any of this alleged footage of the Fourth of July parades being attacked. But if this is a real thing, I would assume that it's wildly out of context. And the violence is about something else entirely different than Mexican people being mad at us patriotism. The purpose of this storyline is to ram into the audience's head that non whites are committing violent crimes against white people. And because they're not white, the media covers it up. This is literally the same rhetoric that the Council of conservative citizens promoted which Dylann Roof cited as the inspiration for his mass murder at Black church. Alex is swimming in those exact same waters here. There's there's no distinguishing between them. They're the same thing.

    | text      = As is the case with pretty much all of Alex's stories. I don't believe this happened. Nope. But if it did, I still struggle to see how it's a meaningful anecdote to inject here. Alex is trying to assert that meta Hispanic Student Organization follows the ideology of this Aztlan document which seeks to recapture the southwest. How does him and his wife overhearing a guy say that he doesn't like English and white people helped make that point? It doesn't. But it probably feels like it does to the audience. Because Alex's complaint about meta isn't the point. There's something behind that story. That is the more important message Alex is trying to get to the audience, which is that Mexican people and non whites in general are a dangerous threat to you. Alex doesn't feel the need to defend his assertion that this group that follows the Aslan plan, that's just taken as proven because he said it. When Alex adds the anecdote about his wife at the convenience store, what he's doing is seeking to reinforce the feeling that Mexican people are a threat to you and secretly hate you, when they think you can't understand what they're saying. They speak of their hate of white people in Spanish. When you look at it through this lens, and with this understanding, it makes total sense why this is the story Alex's mind goes to when he's trying to make his point here. It makes no sense if it's an attempt to prove his meta point, but it's exactly what you do if you're trying to heighten the racist fears that you're trying to stoke this Aztlan document. It was drafted by the first nationals Chicano youth liberation conference in 1969. And there's a fair amount of language in it that does encourage Chicano nationalism and reclaiming the land of their forefathers. Groups like Metro don't express Lee follow this document, though. The A and matcha does stand for asked lamb but that's not weird since it's a fabled ancestral homeland of Aztec people. Yeah. So, I mean, I don't know. It's a little bit of an edge case, I think.

This is not a position that takes the problem that he's pretending to cover seriously. Returning to a genocidal regime is not the solution to crime unless you really believe that the apartheid state and all its human rights abuses were for the greater good. In order for Alex to really believe what he's saying he needs to think that the black population of Rhodesia needed to be kept in line by what amounted to a very severe police state, which he shouldn't have been based on every other thing he claims to believe he shouldn't support that

There are cases where there were real atrocities carried out by two groups of people who had deep disagreements with each other, and their cases where many people in the rest of the world looked on and failed to act in a way that would have helped avoid the severest outcomes. Alex doesn't care about the idea of globalist playing groups off against each other. You can tell that because the util that's the case because the only time he ever talks about how the globalists are playing white people and black people against each other is when he's deep into racist territory and wants to reassure himself that his positions aren't comically racist. Yeah. Alex is sincerely reporting on this episode that black people in South Africa have a plan to kill all the white people when Mandela dies. And he's yearning for the better years when Zimbabwe was under an apartheid government ruled by the 3% of the population that was white.

There's no bill number listed in the article and the person they said sponsored it. Marilyn Chase doesn't have a bill that necessarily fits that description in her resume. In the 2003 2004, Washington house session, she sponsored 428 bills, and I looked through all of them and what do you know that's not there. And it would be kind of hilarious if it were, she's out here, pushing bills about endorsing Dungeness crab fishing and some real Washington specific stuff. And then the next day she decides it's time to limit the number of children people can have. It's weird. Anyway, after way too long of looking through bills about other things like ferry worker collective bargaining rights, I found the bill that they're talking about. It's titled, quote, promoting population sustainability, and it's HB 3111 from the 2003 2004 legislative session. It was introduced on January 28, and was dead on arrival and the GOP stalled permanently in the health care subcommittee. It this was a proposed amendment to our CW 43.7 0.130, which is a section of the Washington legal code that lays out the responsibilities of the Secretary of Health. This bill would have added a 12 item to the list that was, quote, develop and distribute a pamphlet or other educational material that emphasizes the benefits and importance of couples limiting themselves to two or fewer children to promote population sustainability.

Six years ago, the United Nations was calling in over 130/3 World countries, with over 100 manufacturers that was the payoff to the countries to do it, the UN would pay their government to manufacture the vaccine according to their specifications. Tell them what company to hire to do it. That's how they did the pay off the politicians. They caught them in the tetanus shot in a un program just for women because, quote, you know, we're liberal, we care about the women, the boys don't get the tetanus shot. No, no, the girls were giving you something women. And they caught them adding a very expensive synthetic female hormone that had been bound to the tetanus pathogen. And so when the body created an auto immune response to the tetanus, it would also create an autoimmune response to that hormone that was released during pregnancy. And it would attack the different glands in the female reproductive system, and would develop polyps. Generally benign, but in some cases malignant on the ovaries and, and uterus and cause other problems. So yes, yes, yes. I don't know if that's the case with you, fuck you. But a lot of these autoimmune diseases they found with the troops, and in other cases, they're putting very high tech bio weapons that implant cancer, DNA and other things into the population.

Yeah, the tetanus vaccine is largely given to pregnant people in the developing world because they're the ones who are most at risk and the immunity is passed on to the child. neonatal tetanus was a very serious risk factor in infant deaths. So it's why historically it's given to women or pregnant people. It doesn't have this expensive hormone that causes miscarriages in it. That was a claim that was made by anti Vax folks about the tetanus vaccine, but it's nonsense. They claimed that the tetanus vaccine has HCG in it and that it was given to pregnant people so that their bodies would learn to attack the HCG, which is a hormone related to pregnancy, thereby making them unable to have children. In reality, what they're doing is lying about a different birth control vaccine that was tested but never released, where tetanus was used, as a carrier for HCG is the reverse of this, right? They're conflating that stuff altogether. I'm pretty sure we've talked about this in the past, so I'm not gonna dive too deeply into it again. But Alex is essentially pretending to care about people in the developing world by yelling about these imaginary vaccine concerns, when in reality, all he's doing is putting more people at risk. Yeah, so many kids die from neonatal tetanus, and it's entirely avoidable if people just take the vaccine, which is what Alex wants them not to do. In 2000, approximately 170,000 children died of neonatal tetanus compared to just over 14,000 in 2019. And that's what Alex wants to undo. Yeah. So that's B, just I mean, that take that for what it's worth.

No. According to the court case, which case he lost the two Salvadorans were walking across the property on foot, at which point one of the members of the vigilante posse started chasing them, firing numerous gunshots and threatening to kill them. The vigilante searched for the immigrants with a trained Rottweiler attack dog which case he allowed to attack one of the immigrants case he also hit one of them in the back of the head with his gun. The vigilantes held them at gunpoint making them kneel on the ground and subjecting them to a lengthy interrogation. They're held for approximately 90 minutes before they let them go, but not before threatening to kill them. Again, given the fact that this was a matter that appeared before the court, I am going to take this account a little more seriously than this self serving bullshit.
