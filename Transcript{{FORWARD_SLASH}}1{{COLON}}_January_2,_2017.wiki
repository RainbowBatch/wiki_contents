Okay, here are a couple of clips from this day's episode that highlight a tendency within him to want to tell you things but not want to tell you things right. There's this like I II, there's a given take that he does, this goes back to the expert broadcasting thing, right? There's an amazing like, ability to tell you things and not tell you things simultaneously.

For me, it was a very positive experience. It's strange, I think it says sage, but I think he meant strange. It's a strange thing, because you see incredible suffering around you. And the fact that you're in considerable danger yourself, but you're 14 years old, and you don't believe that it can actually touch you. You have a belief in yourself, you have a belief in your father. It's a very happy making exhilarating experience. So people, Alex Jones, in particular takes these quotes to twist it to be like the happiest time in his life was when he was helping Hitler round up Jews, right, which is false on two counts. And I don't believe that Alex doesn't know that. Okay, he's citing these things.
