    | text      = Organized sport that's interesting. It's been a long time. I played basketball in junior high in middle school and then I played football when I went to junior high and I was not good and I faked an injury. That's a good idea. In order to not have to play. I went to the doctor because I had some knee pain and I went to the doctor and he looked at my tendons or something. He was checking me out and he said I had something called Osgood-Schlatter's syndrome.

Because two days were really hard. They sucked didn't they? They were brutal. I just got regular injuries and have a high chance of CTE. I was told that I would be on the line too like on the offensive line and I just was like I'm not going to run into somebody over and over again.
