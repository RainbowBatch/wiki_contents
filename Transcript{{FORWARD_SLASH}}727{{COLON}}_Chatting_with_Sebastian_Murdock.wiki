}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sebastian Murdoch
    | timestamp = 09:24
    | text      = Yeah, absolutely. But there is also as you guys know, so much minutiae in the bullshit of Alex Jones and of Infowars. So there are other times to where it's like Alex Jones, you know, sent sent messages to Roger Stone of his naked wife, which was a rolling story, Rolling Stone article. And so in situations like that, I sort of say, I don't want to write that. Yeah, there's just so much shit, you know, like, right.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sebastian Murdoch
    | timestamp = 10:35
    | text      = Yeah so I'm I'm primarily a breaking news reporter. So you know I cover the the politics and you know the mass shootings that we have and yeah, yeah did any any Cobra breaks. But you know, sometimes investigative stuff too but the Alex Jones saying I've been in one way or another reporting on these defamation lawsuits since 2018. So it's like, you know, a four year build. And now I was actually talking to attorney Mark Bankston, who I know all the walks out there very familiar with,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 11:10
    | text      = they were concerned that he might have died.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sebastian Murdoch
    | timestamp = 11:14
    | text      = Yeah, he was fine. He was good. But, you know, it's, it's interesting to finally see four years of not just reporting but of this process. And now we're finally not even at the first trial, we're at the second trial now. And then there's gonna be a third on the way and so it sort of feels like, you know, the, I don't know if I call it the payoff, but it's all sort of coalescing into, you know, we're getting towards the climax here.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 11:41
    | text      = It does feel like things are speeding up to right, once that first trial hit now it's starting to feel like, oh, it's the next one's right around the corner. This one's gonna be a you know, it's it's happening? Well, I think that's the

    | text      = function of like the delaying show, like, it's just the ball has been kicked down the road so far that like, a lot of this would be the kind of pace things would have gone. Right. Right. Right. Much stalling involved? Exactly.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 12:04
    | text      = What's it been like being in the like, when we were in the Austin courthouse, you know, there's a lot that you see and kind of kind of notice that you don't just by looking through the stream? Like you've been in the courthouse the entire time, right?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sebastian Murdoch
    | timestamp = 12:18
    | text      = Yeah, that's right. I think what's what's very different about this trial, is that in some ways, it's somehow even more sobering. And that isn't to say that the Olson trial wasn't, but here we are in Connecticut, the state where it happened, and there are, you know, so many, so many plaintiffs, so the family members are there. And that, that, I think, has been, you know, incredibly impactful. And, and continues to, to sort of highlight, you know, because for all the sort of laughing that we all do it, Alex, and of course, you guys know, this, like, this is this is about what he did to these parents. And so to have them there, you know, it's it's a humbling experience. And it's also incredibly somber. You know, in a lot of ways,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 13:08
    | text      = I found that to be the incredibly palpable in in Austin, and there was a moment, just watching the stream of this Connecticut case that I thought that for sure, there's no way I could have handled being there for it. And that was when norm Pattis was giving his his opening statement. And he sort of did a, an act out of Alex, being like, alright, I killed the kids. I killed all the kids. Yeah. And yeah, the recognition that these parents were there, and that norm would bring himself to do that. Like I not that I would freak out and jump him or something. But like, I don't know how I could emotionally handle seeing that. It was Yeah, part even on just a stream.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sebastian Murdoch
    | timestamp = 13:58
    | text      = Yeah. I mean, it's that it's that level of of disrespect, right. I mean, we also see it by the fact that Alex can't even show up for these opening statements. He doesn't he's gonna show up when he has to testify. But it's, you know, and Jordan, you you had talked about this a lot when we were in Austin, but the idea that, you know, there have been a lot of news media that we're reporting on. Well, Alex Jones says that he's sorry, he regrets and we know that that's bullshit, because again, he's not showing up to the trial at all. He's on Infowars talking about this case, you know, calling it a kangaroo court. And then like you're saying, Dan, Norm paddock gets out there and he starts doing that, that mimicry in front of the parents whose kids were killed.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 14:42
    | text      = Yeah. And also norm saying that their argument is that they're exaggerating their trauma.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sebastian Murdoch
    | timestamp = 14:47
    | text      = Yeah, well, well, Norm also fell asleep in the courtroom. So he was also he was also nodding off.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 14:54
    | text      = Yeah, he that's when you were saying that like something that's different about this from the office. Sten I have to imagine that just the existence of norm Pattice makes this feel entirely different.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sebastian Murdoch
    | timestamp = 15:08
    | text      = Yeah you know what's what's kind of surreal though is I still can't figure out who the worst lawyer is if it's gonna be padded right all I've
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 15:17
    | text      = we've we've had some disagreement over this ourselves. I genuinely think that norm for what he's doing is doing about as good as he could possibly do it. Right. I mean, the bar looting falling asleep in the trial. Like that's he's doing what he's supposed to be taking a power nap. Yeah, he was talking to shit. He's been an asshole. That's what he's supposed to be doing.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 15:38
    | text      = Yeah, Brian made that point on Infowars. Even he was saying that this is how you deal with a rogue judge or whatever. And like, that is obviously not the case. That's not the situation. But what norm is doing is the only thing they can do, which is throw bombs, basically.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Sebastian Murdoch
    | timestamp = 15:53
    | text      = Yeah, exactly. Flinging mud and hope that you know, daddy, Alec feeds it back in Austin.

{{TranscriptBlock

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 16:06
    | text      = Well, I do find it interesting because it does feel a little bit like norm saw the first trial and re now went with his like halfway appeasing halfway trying to slime ball evil into places. And then he was like, well, that last, so fuck it, I'm just gonna try and sling as much shit as I can. And maybe it'll lower the judgment. You know, maybe people will be like, I guess they are exaggerating i Why else?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock

I think it's also a much longer trial. So that's going to be part of it. What I've noticed in in the Connecticut trial, you know, this first week, we've only we've had Brittany paws on the stand for three days. It's been out there kind of long and tiring. But through that we have gotten, I think, a lot of good new information of the internal inner workings of Infowars. They've got they've got the the marketing kits that Infowars was sending out to advertisers. You know, we have to prove that they were using Google Analytics, the thing that Jones and Infowars got sanctioned for minutes before the trial even began. So I think, you know, in terms of that, I think it's a it's creating a pretty powerful argument. We saw, I want to run this one this number off real quick, because it really did shock me. September 24 2014, Infowars. Store gets $48,000. The following day, they push the story FBI says nobody killed at Sandy Hook massacre. It increases to $232,000. Yeah, I mean, that is insane.

And, and, you know, he's essentially hyperventilating on the stand because he, he's, not only did he have to relive the horror of what he saw that day, but as he said, in trial, he had to say it in front of the family members.

They're there in courtroom every day, Alex is hiding in Texas, and they're, they're not even on days. They're not testifying, they're showing up to the courtroom.
