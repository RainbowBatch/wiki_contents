'''"Fentanyl the Chinese dragon"''' is an extremely racist character / impression that [[Alex Jones|Alex]] semi-regularly does on his show.

The basic conceit is that Fentanyl is a cartoon embodiment of Alex's version of the Chinese Communist Party. The character is usually represented on screen with a (also super racist) computer generated avatar (which maybe tracks Alex's face, like a VTuber thing?) and consists of Alex doing a really racist sing-song voice while pretending to gloat about how China is doing terrible things to America. It's even more disgusting than it sounds.

The character is so over the top that [[Dan Friesen|Dan]] has speculated that it is mostly an attempt to bait the wider media into covering Alex. Conversely, Alex might just be that racist.
