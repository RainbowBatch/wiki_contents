Although I mean today, I've said that about Yeah, we've back and forth. Yeah. So who knows? But I think that Alex couldn't get Mel Gibson, but he could get dad shortly. Oh, there we go. All right. We've talked about this before. But hunting Gibson is a very explicit anti Semite. And Alex has no excuse not to know that he's been pretty public about not only his belief that the Holocaust was, quote, maybe not all fiction, but most, but also that he believes that the Jews are behind the plot to bring in a one world government. So when Alex interviews in pretending he's an expert on the New World Order and all that shit, it's important to remember that whether or not he's explicit about it on air, everything Hutton is saying is an allegation of an anti Jewish conspiracy. There are really only two options about this. Either Alex knows this and agrees with Hutton or he doesn't care that he's helping spread really vicious anti semitism because he's being allowed to talk to a celebrity's dad, and that's pretty exciting for him. It's worth noting that the American free press is a white supremacist Holocaust denying rag run by Willis carto. But that the speech Hutton gave wasn't to them. Alex is saying that because he doesn't really No. Okay, okay. They just reported on the speech okay. The actual speech was the We the People conference, which was full of sovereign citizens and a bunch of other varieties of bigot. The editor of the Council of conservative citizens also spoke which you may remember was the outlet the published fraudulent race crime statistics, which were the impetus for Dylann roofs racist mass murder. Yeah. So all all in the mix? Yeah,

    | text      = makes metaphor twice. smart, smart. So it's pretty interesting booking that Alex as someone who is actually in the German government coming on to the show, but he's doing a lot of exaggerating with this resume. Von Bulow was the Minister for research and technology from 1980 to 1982. And previous to that he had been the parliamentary state secretary in the ministry of defense from 1976 to 1980. That's not the equivalent of our Secretary of Defense, which is what Alex says it is, but it is a high ranking position. Okay, so there's a minister of defense, and then there are two parliamentary state secretaries beneath them, and von Bulow was one of them. Okay. He's also not been in government up to approximately a year before this, as Alex is saying is like, Oh, he's just got out of government. Yeah, it had been almost a decade since he left the Bundestag in 1994. Alex wants to make it appear that he was in government way more recently, because it's important to create the image that he was in in an official position around the time of 911. So his claims have more authority. In reality, he just wrote a book called the CIA in September 11, which is kind of shit. It's more or less a compilation of the kind of unsourced rumors and theories that fly around on Alex's show, which von Bulow then insists that the US government has a responsibility to disprove the burden of proof is on them from the things that I'm saying, Yeah, I

    | text      = industrial complex? Okay, thanks for the call. That's a really good question, Bob. I bet we answered the military industrial complex that Dwight D. Eisenhower talked about, in his farewell address of 1960. In his farewell address, he talked about how the corporations that had grown up through World War Two in the Korean War, through the funding, through the hundreds of millions of dollars of funding, had taken over almost all of the programs, research programs, universities, had bought up most of the private inventions and inventors and laboratories, and that they had centralized control of the brain trust of Western civilization in just a handful of companies. And he said that that stifled competition, he said that that centralized power, and that because they now own the universities, and because the military industrial complex, was buying up, ABC and CBS and NBC, which was happening right at that I'm sorry, can they do they were going to control all the information, all the technology, and that it was and by the way, we've heard this feature before, that it was a foregone conclusion that martial law would be shut up, because throughout history, when military industrial complexes which they had in Germany and England got big enough, they would always take total control.

Yeah, pretty much and absolutely is not what Eisenhower was saying in his farewell address. Some of it is just fabricated from thin air. And some of it is just flagrant misrepresentations of things that Eisenhower did say, what are the more basic misrepresentations Alex is making is that he's combining two things that Eisenhower was presenting as two separate thoughts is Alex combining them into one? Okay, okay. There. There's concerns about the military industrial complex. And then there's concerns about inventors, they're separate. Okay. Eisenhower brings up to their new threats and stressors that risk thrown the country out of balance and says, quote, threats, new unkind or degree constantly arise, I mentioned to only then he brings up the two which are the military industrial complex, and the way that innovation and technological advancement had become heavily reliant on funding from government programs. These are two separate things that Alex has turned into one which is not supported by the text. According to Eisenhower, the military industrial industrial complex is the state of affairs, we found ourselves in where the United States had a quote, permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. It's the product of being aware that we need to have weapons ready when the next war breaks out. And the industry that makes that possible, the combining of the two, and the influence that is gained from

However, there are many US citizens who are entitled to Social Security benefits who live outside of the United States. So there is a need to accommodate these people who live abroad. That's why at many US embassies, there's a federal benefits unit, which houses the office of earnings and international operations. There are actually three such offices in Mexico, two in consulates, and one at the embassy. This has nothing to do with giving non US citizens benefits, but it has the air of being just suspicious enough that presented with no context or even better presented with fake context. It can convince people like this caller that there's something nefarious going on. It's really sad how uncurious these Infowars listeners are all while considering themselves the real truth seekers, yeah, like ask yourself for a second, why would there need to be people who have some involvement with Social Security in foreign countries? At say, an embassy? No, something like it? Why would that be necessary? Obviously, American citizens live outside the United States.

Because you ask yourself that question and then immediately you have conspiracy theorists running in with the answer and that is is because they're trying to turn the United States, Canada and Mexico into the same countries where they can give Mexican people Social Security.

    | text      = The League of the South is a group that is interested in reducing the Civil War and having the south secede. However, they're also interested in creating a white nationalist state out of what happens after secession. They're widely recognized hate group and for a short while they were included in the incorporation that was known as the nationalist front. This was a group that also included the Klan and the outright Nazis, Vanguard America. The Nationalist front was an attempt to bring all these scattered white supremacist groups who are pushing for an ethnos state together so they could be under one banner and get more work done. Unsurprisingly, that all happened just after Trump got elected, and they were the most like biggest thing that you probably have known their work from is the white lives matter type Message area that people were so thrilled about, right. Typically, they've been more of a white supremacist slash segregationist group. But they also dabbled quite a bit in anti semitism. In 2018, their founder Michael Hill posted this on social media, quote, The Jews claws are sunk too deeply in the United States. For her to survive in her present form, we must have an independent self to read our part of the earth of this pestilence, there must be no Jew influence on our new nation state. That is the foundational concern that must be taken care of before anything else, this independent South will once again be a white man's land share trip. This is a group that Alex is letting his collar promote with no pushback at all. This is what Alex promotes. But I haven't Hutton Gibson on and saying that he's accurate about everything. Alex is begging his audience to go find out what Hutton says, which will then be read with the listener knowing that what they're reading has Alex's stamp of approval, it's legitimately impossible to go back to this period of time on Alex's show and not recognize that he's pushing his audience toward a very extreme sort of ideology and ideologues. And I personally don't think it's an accident. You can't convince me that Alex doesn't know what the League of the South is. He loves secession. And he's bragged in the past about being Confederate royalty. He knows who this group is, and he's fine with promoting it. He doesn't jump in and say something like a secession is fine, but those people are racist to Nazis, or if he wants to keep on pretending that right wing racists and Nazis don't exist. He could just say that they're secretly Feds or something like that. It's so easy. He doesn't do that. Because he's into the his audience joining the League of the South, because the League of the South pursues the state of affairs in the world that Alex wants to come into being. Yeah, it's just kind of that simple.

If we had a white nationalist movement, secession, what or whatever right now and they got their own little country or whatever, they would rapidly discover that most of our lives are built on the backs of everybody but white people.
