The Obama deception, tapa marks, well, that was kind of more of his, his bread and butter was a bit more of the like video production and the documentary side of stuff. And he sent leaving Infowars by being fired. He filed an EEOC complaint against Infowars alleging anti semitic treatment that he endured on on from other employees and from Alex. I mean, that's not hard. That's not a hard jump to make. No. Notably, he has alleged and I certainly believe this is true, that Rob do and Owen Shroyer would refer to him as the resident jus, among other things that were made a hostile work environment tracks. So since he's left, he has also taken on a bit of a anti Alex posture, let's say, yeah, he appears in like various documentaries that will be made on on CNN,

Right, right, those those folks, whereas maybe a Jakari, Jackson isn't going to show up for the years, we want that part of his life, no to be analyzed. And I think that there is a part of it that Rob feels a desire for some pennants. And I can, I can understand that on some level, but I also find it uncompelled In many ways. So we're going to go through this deposition, but it's challenging a little bit because of that dynamic, that I do feel like he is probably in many ways sincerely guilty about what he was involved in Sure. To the extent that it relates to Sandy Hook. Now, I don't see a ton of examination of the larger catalogue of his work that he did, and how very similar it is to the coverage of Sandy Hook. And how he does not seem to have any, necessarily a problem with like his end game.

    | timestamp = 00:10:15.000
    | text      = do now. Yeah. The first couple of clips are a bit long. And the reason for that is there is chaos at the beginning of this deposition. Mark. Bankston is taking the deposition. And he begins trying to just say, Please introduce yourself. Good luck. And then Alex's lawyer, Enoch. He comes in and gets out of line. And it's very hard to present this in small chunks. So I have about a five minute clip here. And I think it needs to be presented as a whole thing in order to really get the feeling of this and how there's an ink Enos to it Oh, boy, and a discomfort and you can see it in Rob's face. Yes.

And that Mark can ask questions from on behalf of the plaintiffs. But he is not representing Rob and Rob has no lawyer there. Okay. On behalf of like free speech systems, and all those other lawyers, all those other entities, Enoch is there defending the deposition. Gotcha. But according to Mark, and I think he makes a decent case. He has no right, necessarily to take discovery from Rob Jacobson. Yeah. That is the cross examination has not necessarily been signed off on

    | text      = to object and the drama and the chaos here at the beginning largely comes down to that the fact that Rob Jacobson signed an NDA when he worked at Infowars. Okay. And so, on behalf of free speech systems, and Alex Jones, Enoch can say things like, I don't think you should answer that based on the NDA. Right, right existed in that space. But then it's kind of an open question and a little bit unclear. Well, at least Mark believes one thing and Enoch believes the other right in terms of whether or not Alex's lawyer has the ability to question the witness. Right. And so that is a problem. There disagreement is a mess.

I don't understand why your next step wouldn't be like, maybe we should watch more of the show and see if they're doing this all the time. Yeah, maybe I should see if they're treating other subjects with this much disrespect and lack of care. Maybe I'm involved in a really awful thing here. Yeah, it seems like. And I think that everybody wants to pretend this, especially everybody who worked at Infowars. This is like a unique, isolated thing. Yeah. It's just an aberration.

It's really hard to understand you fucked up if people give you positive consequences for it, or encourage you to keep doing it. Well, so so to me, it does make sense in a certain way for him to think that he's done a good job on some stuff, because people gave him positive reinforcement for sure.

The only thing he has to apologize for, I guess, is that he didn't quit. Yeah, that's all he has to apologize for. And that has no real relevance in a courtroom. No, it has no real relevance in a deposition. As they go through the questions about this stuff that is relevant to Sandy Hook. He doesn't know that much. The only thing that you could really concretely take away from this perhaps is that like, he's an AV guy. Right? He can speak with some credibility about the idea of Anderson Cooper's nose on a blue screen. Sure. So like there's that, that he can offer as like my expert witness witness. But there's other people you could get to do that. Yeah, I don't I don't know. I guess I appreciate on some level that he feels bad about connecting him being connected to this right.

These people were not there to Hillary, this is far after the election, nobody was campaigning. But Miss Millie Weaver decided to show up with a lot of Trump gear, which obviously is going to be as we follow the news, we know is agitating towards in a very political way, you know, so, in my opinion, just by looking at that, I noticed that reporters don't show up sponsoring politicians. So for her to go there and say and in fact, the name of this video on YouTube is called journalist harassed or something. She identifies herself as a journalist, while she shows up wearing political gear, directly aiming at the opposite end of the spectrum, asking a brace of questions about Hillary Hillary Clinton. Now that's not journalism. That's agitation. And that is a clear cut case example of them swapping out the words agitation for journalism and vice versa.

    | text      = I need to put this on the record. Because we are now in our third deposition of this case. And the first deposition of Mr. Jones, which Mr. Enoch was not defending, but was merely an observer, his name appeared in all caps, where he's speaking and interjecting into the record 28 times during the testimony of Mr. Jones. And that's taking up the times that it appeared for housekeeping matters, like getting the witness water. We're talking about the PIO at the end of the deposition. And I don't want to be tag teamed, and it was ridiculous and improper, but I normally wouldn't call it out on the record. But I've reviewed the transcript. And I've done this to confirm this, that there were questions on the floor about what a certain building was, and whether it was the school or not. And as part of his interruption, Mr. Enoch blurted out to the witness that it's the firehouse and the video word that had not previously appeared in the deposition. So of course, right after that, Mr. Jones says, quote, and I later corrected, you know, that was one of the things that had been said that wasn't true was that they were at the firehouse. There was there was other footage from the school. At best, this was highly improper conduct, and it's exactly why we don't allow speaking objections in Texas. At worst, it was an attempt to communicate an idea to the witness conduct which is absolutely repellent to the idea of justice. Yet on the following day, the problems continued. I only have a video not a transcript, but one again, Mr. Enoch repeatedly interrupted a deposition he was not defending it which he was simply an observer. And again, I've watched the video to confirm and so as my co counsel to confirm both of ours memories that Mr. Du, the corporate representative, visibly reacted to a gesture from Mr. Enoch during a difficult question. And Mr. Ogden had to call them out on it. And you can see Mr. Jews reaction and they were his eyes are in the deposition. During both depositions, Mr. Enoch was repeatedly asked to leave the deposition, if you refuse to stay quiet, he stayed but continued to interrupt. I am putting this all on the record right now, because this deposition began rather continuously. And my reaction to it was one of significant disturbance. So
