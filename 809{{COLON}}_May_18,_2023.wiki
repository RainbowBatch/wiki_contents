Today, Dan and Jordan check into how things are going for Alex in the present day.  Turns out, not well.  In this installment, Alex interviews a lawyer idiot, interviews a fellow talk show host idiot, and reports on the absurd story that 139 US hospitals had "kill floors" where doctors murdered Covid patients.
