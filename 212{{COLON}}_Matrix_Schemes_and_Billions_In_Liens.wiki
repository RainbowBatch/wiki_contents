Today, Dan is still slightly on the mend from being sick, so he and Jordan put off getting back into [[Alex Jones]] by taking a little Wednesday [[Project Camelot]] break. On this installment, Sweary Kerry interviews a woman who claims that she owns the rights to The Matrix and Terminator franchises. Tune in to learn whether or not that is true, and whether or not she's also psychic (spoiler alert: she is).
