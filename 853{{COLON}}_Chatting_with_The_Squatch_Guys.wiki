In this installment, Dan and Jordan chat with [[Solomon Berg]] and Daniel Jordan (aka Barry and Andrew), the two gents behind the riveting Ambassador saga on [[Project Camelot]].  The conversation gets into all manner of revelations one might come to by entering the the paranormal conspiracy space, and if the strategy of stealthily injecting reality into unreal spaces has any promise.
