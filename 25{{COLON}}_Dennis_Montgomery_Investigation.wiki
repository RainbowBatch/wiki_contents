Today's episode is a little bit different. Today, Dan tells Jordan about the findings of his investigation into a narrative that Alex pitched through the entire week of March 20-24, and demonstrates pretty well that Alex is pretty full of shit.

The narrative has to do with alleged proof that the NSA was spying on Trump (and many others), but upon closer examination, the bizarre story weaves into the actions of a racist Arizona sheriff, a gambling addict with a deep history of fraud, and a completely insane lawyer.
