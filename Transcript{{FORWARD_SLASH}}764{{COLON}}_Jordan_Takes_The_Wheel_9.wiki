We think of you know, some of the celebrities would be like the Grim Reaper are the angel of death, or Anubis and Egypt or Hermes in Greece, Odin, and Stuart, Valka, Valkyries, and some Norse mythologies. But these are figures that lead you across that threshold, they take you and they guide you across that threshold depending upon the certain religious system, you might actually see them crop up in your lives during points of transition as well. Not only these figures, but also you see certain natural phenomena like the sun in the moon serving the psychopomp role of carrying souls to the afterlife. And you also see animals and the animals that you see almost embody almost always embody themes of companionship and or transportation and things like dogs, obviously leading you and guiding you and being a faithful companion horses which can take you places that birds which can travel to places that they can't on their own, but also anything that is weighing and including moths and you know it was very Coco Griff in certain mess of America account ID so think of anything we moths and butterflies as being psychopaths that actually carry the soul away on your wings.
