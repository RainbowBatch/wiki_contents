We're a couple dudes who like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones. Indeed we are, Dan. Jordan. Dan? Jordan. What's your bright spot this week? Well, my bright spot for today is somewhat aspirational. Because it's not, it doesn't exist yet. It hasn't existed. It may never exist, but I intend to. Okay. I realized, sitting around a little bored, that I have never made lasagna. You've never made lasagna? No. Okay!

Naturally. Yes, that's simple enough. You go to the store and get those, but I don't have the right pan. Sure. I can go get one of those pans. It can be done. It seems like such a pie-in-the-sky kind of thing. Making lasagna. Like me making lasagna. Get the fuck out of here. Honestly, it's never occurred to me to do. It seems, it seems like something, I like lasagna quite a bit. I think it's a delicious food.

It's imagining eventually that I will make a lasagna. First, to make a lasagna, you have to visualize making a lasagna. And I think that makes perfect sense. I'm fine with that. How about you? The Final Fantasy VII Remake, Dan? Yeah, you've been looking forward to this for quite a while. Oh my god, I've been looking into this for five years, Dan! Five years!

It wasn't in the original version. Well, it was, it was hinted at in the original version. What they've done is they took the first few hours of the original game and expanded it into the entire game. Okay. So there's some stuff that was hinted at where, when they blew up their, because basically, it's an eco-terrorist group that you start. Okay. Joining and so on.

It's a game that I would like to play because it's one of those games that everybody who is really interested in video games will tell you ad nauseum how great it is. And I've never played any of the Final Fantasy games, so it seems like that's something I should give a shot at some point. Yeah. I might, I might not. We'll see after this lasagna.
