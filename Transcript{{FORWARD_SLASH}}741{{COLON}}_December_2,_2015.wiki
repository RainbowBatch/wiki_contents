And I like because I remember back when I used to work at a movie theater. And you know, like, it was always so much easier to clean the floors at the movie theater than it is at home. And I realized the reason why is it is so awful to bend down with the dustpan and waffle or it's a real hassle to like sweep up a pile and then write out the vacuum and vacuum that right.

    | text      = My bright spot is the British game show. Only connect. So it's a like a trivia show. Right? But it's not, you have to know an absurd amount of trivia. But what's interesting about the game is that it's about finding the connections between things. So they'll give you like a clue. And then they'll give you another clue. And then we'll have to figure out what connects all four of these things. So that impulse that so many people have towards making up connections, you know, our brains are wired to find connections even if they aren't there. It can be used for good to find out weird strange things like they might play four songs and you'd be like, Oh, in Greek these all start with an eye like it's that kind of level of Yoda. Yeah, how specific you have to be to combine those things. And it just be like three pop songs. And the only an obscene insane person will be like, well, obviously, you translate the title to Greek. And then if you do that, you can see that all four of these are the same thing.

But I actually think it's the best thing for him and I don't. Big, big picture and for the world, I think it's exactly what needs to happen. Yeah, it's great. He clearly could not stop himself from further defaming people involved in the Sandy Hook lawsuit, saying that man, maybe Sandy Hook was fake could not stop himself from doing that at all. Yep. He clearly has a lot of business he needs to take care of with his lawyers visa vie. The cases that have already happened, the the illusions about the appeal, right, the bankruptcy process, all of this stuff clearly requires a ton of attention. And he's only going to make things worse for himself if he's on air. So, I mean, he doesn't have a deep bench. There's not a lot of people that can fill in, you can clearly see the drop off in viewership on bamdad video. The episodes were Oh, and toasting. Oh, Alex. Yeah, it's unfortunate.

And while we're there now 740. So maybe, you know, as Alex is on vacation, it might be time to look back. I think it's great to take a peek at this. I will say I turned off this episode. At a certain point. That's fair. And that is because there's a bit of bullshit. There's the Trump interview. There's some other bullshit. Yeah. And then Alex is like, I'm going to interview Lord Monckton, and I say it's click No, thanks. Yeah, no, thank you. I'm not really all that interested in that weirdo. Yeah.

Last week, this interview was supposedly happening today, but as it neared, and as we talked to his people, and as all they got set up, got pretty excited that I'm gonna let the Drudge Report tell folks in about 15 minutes who's coming on the show. Now the thing is Skype testing on the road is always a hassle. So that's going on right now as we speak with them. So I'd rather be in there monkeying around with that to make sure it all happens because the bigger the interview, the more Gremlins snack foods tend to get in the way but that's not something I'm particularly worried about here today. This will be an important interview, not just for this broadcast, the liberty movement, but the questions that will be asked are going to be very, very important and we'll definitely have an effect on a lot of things happening on the planet.

    | text      = Trump was not vindicated in his claims and people booing at a soccer game or saying Allahu Akbar has nothing to do with the claims that he made. So leave that aside. That's a basically inexplicable, quarter inexplicable. And if you want to say like, during a moment of silence, people shouldn't yell anything. Yeah. And that's fine, but you're making it a little bit targeted here a little bit. So what happened was the Trump said something completely inaccurate. And then instead of admitting that he was wrong, he pretended he'd made a completely different claim altogether. He initially said, quote, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where 1000s and 1000s of people were cheering as the building was coming down. 1000s of people were cheering so something's going on. We've got to find out what it is. a Washington Post article from around 911 does mention unverified claims of small amounts of people allegedly celebrating on a rooftop, but there's no video evidence of this ever happening. Reporters have estimated that it was maybe six to 12 Teenagers quote, but even that is doubtful. So that could be what he's talking about. But he said he saw a video. Anyway, at this point when Alex is interviewing him, the goalposts have completely moved. And now Trump is declaring that he was correct because someone found video of Palestinian celebrating in the occupied West Bank. This is not what Trump had claimed, and what people were saying he was making up. This is the state of things at this point, and Trump is not at all vindicated. Also, Alex should be really against Trump's idea of surveilling mosques. That seems wildly against Alex's principles about freedom of religion and the Fourth Amendment, but I guess he doesn't really care about those things too much when the group being targeted to someone other than himself. And you have Trump essentially arguing for increased surveillance in a way that Alex would decry. Is tyranny in any other context? And instead of giving any pushback, he's just right along with Trump in it, and that's not not, he should have stayed up for hours preparing his questions and maybe stealing his resolve to be able to push back in this setting.

I mean, I really study this stuff. I really find it very interesting. And even though I'm a businessman, I find it I've always had, I always had been involved in politics, I said, we better be careful with Osama bin Laden, there's a guy named Osama bin Laden, nobody really knew who he was. But he was nasty. He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it. And I wrote the book, 2002 years before the World Trade Center came down, I talked about Osama bin Laden, you better take him out, he's gonna grow under a rock, you better take them out. And now people are seeing that the same, you know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden, which actually is true. And then two years later, a year and a half later, he knocked down the World Trade Center. And I talked about terrorism and that that was before terrorism, as we know it today. I said, We'd better be careful, that's gonna happen. It's gonna be a big thing. And it certainly is a big thing.

Of course, none of this is addressed.

But I have respect for a number of people that are on the stage with the respect for a lot of people that are throughout this country poll, you know, political people, optics, somebody, I think that can really be a great Vice President who ultimately has to be a great president, because that's, you know, 90% of that function is, you know, if some thing bad happens, we gotta be good president, you have to view it from that standpoint. And my president in the more or less modern year would be Ronald Reagan. I've always liked him. By the way, he was a Democrat. A lot of people don't know he was of a liberal Democrat, Alex, as you know. And he became a somewhat conservative wouldn't say the most conservative but a somewhat conservative Republican wanted to make America great. And he really did he wanted to make he had actually, let's make America great. That was his and mine is make America great again. So there's a little bit of a difference.

    | text      = So this is fun because Joe Biggs is currently facing seditious conspiracy charges for his actions on January 6, where he was part of the proud boy leadership they plan to invade the capitol to stop the certification of the 2020 election. Also, this is a little bit before he got into his pizza gate bullshit. also noting is worth noting is that this trip that Biggs went on is something that we actually have some insight into thanks to information relayed by Josh Owens, in his piece in The New York Times, he worked for Infowars and was along for this very trip that's going to be discussed. Here's how he described it to the times. Quote, In December 2015, the day before Jones interviewed Donald Trump still a candidate at the time on his radio show, I made my way to upstate New York on assignment along with a reporter and second cameraman, we were sent to visit Muslim majority communities throughout the United States to investigate what Jones instructed us to call the American caliphate after the California Geiger counter debate debacle that was when they were sent out to get evidence that there was radiation and what have you and it didn't work out. It's very funny. We had meetings with Jones before trips in order to ascertain exactly what he wanted. If we quote hit some home runs, he said we would get significant bonuses. They tried to make contact with folks in a community called Islam Berg, but were turned away because of concerns for security. From Josh's article, quote, because of the conspiracy theories about the place Islam Berg was a constant target of right wing extremists. That April a Tennessee man was arrested and later convicted of plotting to raise a militia to burn Islam Berg's mosque to the ground. Only days before we arrived, the FBI had issued an alert to law enforcement to be on the lookout for a man named John Retimer, a leader of an anti Muslim movement in Arizona who posted a video threatening violence against Muslims less than two weeks earlier. So the phone call we received later that night from a law enforcement agent shouldn't have come as a surprise. The officer who contacted us said he simply wanted to verify who we were after receiving a concern call from somebody in Islaam Burg when he told Jones about it, and he chose to believe the call was a veiled threat and attempt to intimidate us into silence. To him this verified that we were onto something. He even went so far as to include Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City in the purported conspiracy, claiming he wanted to abolish the Second Amendment and that somehow intimidating us would achieve that. Jones told us to file a story that accused the police of harassment lending credence to the theory that this community contain dangerous potential terrorists. I knew this wasn't the case according to the information we had. We all did. Days before we spoke to the sheriff and the mayor of deposit New York nearby municipality. They both told us the people in his Lomberg were kind, generous neighbors who welcomed the surrounding community into their homes, even celebrating holidays together. The information did not meet our expectations. So we made it up preying on the vulnerable and feeding the prejudices and fears of Jones's audience. We ignored certain facts fabricated others and took situations out of context to fit our narrative. So that's going on right now. Joe Biggs is filing the first report from this clear, fraudulent coverage that was meant intentionally to stoke agitate against Muslim communities. Yep. And you can hear even in Alex's coverage of this video that Biggs is going to be airing that is American caliphate. The framing Yeah, came from Alex himself. And it was like, This is what you're going out to create justification for coverage. Right. And it's pretty sad. It's pretty sad. Yeah. It's the same day that Trump is on the show. Yeah,
