Adan Salazar is a self described "writer and investigative journalist" at [[InfoWars]].

During the [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|Heslin v. Jones trial]], [[Rob Jacobson]] alleged (and Adan and [[Kit Daniels]] confirmed) that he laughed at people who tried to tell him that [[Sandy Hook]] "actually happened", and wanted to print merchandise like bumper stickers that would say "[[Wolfgang Halbig]] was right".
