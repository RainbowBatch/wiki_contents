'''Mike Lindell''' is an American businessman, walking fever-dream, and the CEO of MyPillow who has become a prominent supporter of [[Donald Trump]] and a vocal proponent of various conspiracy theories related to the [[2020 US presidential election]]. He has faced criticism and legal challenges related to his claims about the election, which have been widely debunked by experts and fact-checkers.

In the aftermath of the 2020 US presidential election, Lindell became a leading proponent of the unfounded claim that the election was rigged against Trump. He funded and produced a two-hour documentary titled "Absolute Proof," which claimed to provide evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election. The documentary was widely criticized for its lack of evidence and factual inaccuracies.  In January 2021, he was photographed carrying notes that appeared to reference martial law and the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act in order to overturn the election results<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/us/politics/mike-lindell-notes-west-wing.html</ref>. Lindell is currently a defendant in a number of legal challenges related to his probably defamatory claims about the election. For instance, Dominion Voting Systems filed a defamation lawsuit against Lindell, alleging that he had falsely accused the company of being involved in a conspiracy to rig the election.
