Today, Dan and Jordan check in on the present day on the Alex Jones Show and find a very bizarre but unsurprising picture. Alex is pretty all over the place, passionately defending the idea of Trump enacting martial law, extolling absurd Doomsday Prophecies, and coming off like a real gross bigot. Pretty normal stuff to hear from Alex in 2019.
