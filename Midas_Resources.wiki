Midas Resources was a gold and precious metals company heavily involved in sponsoring [[Alex Jones]] and [[InfoWars]]. Both Midas Resources and [[Genesis Communications Network]] are owned by [[Ted Anderson]]. See Ted's page for some more details about the weird relationships between Midas Resources, GCN, and InfoWars.

In 2015, Ted was sued and lost his ability to sell gold in Minnesota, shuttering Midas Resources.
