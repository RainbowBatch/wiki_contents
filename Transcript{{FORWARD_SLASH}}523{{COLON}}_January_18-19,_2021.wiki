A lot of disappointment. You don't have to listen to 12 hours. Well, I don't have to listen to all of it. Harrison Smith's hosting, I'm sure, a good bit of it. The Capitol has unfallen. Oh no.

Yeah, the 18th and the 19th. Yes. The last days when Trump could do something weird while Alex is on air.
