Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened on last Friday and this Monday's episodes of The Alex Jones Show. The episode begins with a discussion of why it appears that Alex is in league with Nazis, then spirals out of control as Alex makes a surprising confession, Owen Shroyer shows his incompetence, and Alex gets very introspective and starts speaking in riddles.
