'''Gavin McInnes''' is a failed stand up and former leader of a completely idiotic white nationalist fraternity called [[The Proud Boys]].

Whenever Gavin is on [[The Alex Jones Show]], he wastes most of his time doing incredibly hacky stand up bits about feminism, gay people, or "the leftists" that would not pass muster at an open mic. He has falsely claimed that [[George Soros]] "led Nazis to Jews," which is something he can in no way prove.

He has also been frustrated that people think that "[[Globalists|Globalist]]" is a dog-whistle for Jews, [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|when it absolutely is]].

Once it became clear that The Proud Boys increasingly violent activities were attracting the attention of law enforcement<ref>https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys</ref>, McInnes announced he was dissociating himself from the group in late 2018.

[[Enrique Tarrio]] took leadership of The Proud Boys after McInnes. Given that Tarrio is currently facing seditious conspiracy charges for his role in planning [[January 6th]], McInnes' choice to distance himself was probably smart. He still continues to hold all the violent and bigoted beliefs that lead him to form a group that assaulted the U.S. Capitol though, so don't give him too much credit.
