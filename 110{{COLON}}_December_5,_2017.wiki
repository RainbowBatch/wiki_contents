Today, Dan tells Jordan all about how Alex Jones couldn't stop interrupting a clip from Morning Joe that he played on his December 5th show. It takes Alex about 45 min of showtime to get through less than a minute of content, and boy, his analysis of it all is weak.

Also, Alex admits that he started an entirely new sales website so he could skirt pricing agreements that he's signed with suppliers.
