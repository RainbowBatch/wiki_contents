We know that we made every endeavor to bring Mr. Montgomery, his information to federal authorities. Like I said earlier, we contacted Larry Klayman for his assistance. And under the direction of Sheriff Arpaio, we brought Mr. Montgomery to judge Royce Lamberth, we used to be the head of the FISA Court, Judge Lamberth was the FISA judge that authorized the bin Laden wiretaps in his living room at three o'clock in the morning. And we got him there. The dilemma was, for all involved, is where do we go with this? Mr. Montgomery, during his tenure as a contractor, the FBI, and this is in court documents, had illegally executed a search warrant on his home with fabricated affidavits to a judge. And that was all bared out in a trial.

Young brought this up in court to Arpaio, quote, at least by November 2014, you knew Dennis Montgomery was a fraud? That's the question that young asked.
