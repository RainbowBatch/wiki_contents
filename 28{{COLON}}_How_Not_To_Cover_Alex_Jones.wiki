Today, Dan tells Jordan a bit more about why he believes that taking [[Alex Jones]] out of context, or using him in funny clip montages is a dangerous game that you really can't win. To illustrate his point, the two discuss a video that Alex released recently in response to Media Matters posting a clip of his. It's a cycle with no winners, and truly the only way out is to utilize a different approach, namely the Knowledge Fight Approach.
