Following the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting Parkland Shooting], InfoWars published photos of an innocent man, Marcel E. Fontaine, falsely claiming that they depicted the shooter. These photos were accompanied with florid (and false) claims about the shooter's ideology as a Communist and his supposed affiliation with ISIS. As a result of InfoWars actions, Fontaine's photo was widely disseminated on social media<ref>https://infowarslawsuit.com/fontaine-versus-jones/</ref>.

Fontaine sued Alex Jones and his Companies for defamation in early 2018. Fontaine was represented by [[Mark Bankston]] and [[Bill Ogden]] of [http://fbtrial.com/ Farrar & Bell LLP]. This case inspired several Sandy Hook parents to approach Farrar & Bell<ref>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Former-Norwalk-resident-29-who-sued-Alex-Jones-17182364.php</ref>, and would lead the [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|Sandy Hook defamation case in Texas]].

In October of 2021, and after years of sanctionable conduct by the Jones Defendants, [[Judge Maya Gamble]] issued a default judgement, meaning that Jones and his companies are presumed to have committed the alleged conduct and will have to pay damages<ref>https://infowarslawsuit.com/alex-jones-will-have-to-pay-families-in-lawsuits-over-sandy-hook-shooting-judge-rules/</ref>. The trial to determine the amount of damages is ongoing, but scheduled to begin in late 2022.

On May 14th, 2022, Marcel died in a tragic apartment fire<ref>https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thehour/name/marcel-fontaine-obituary?id=34895797</ref>.
