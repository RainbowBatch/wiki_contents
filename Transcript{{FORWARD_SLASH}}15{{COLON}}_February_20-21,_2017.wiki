And it turns out, I don't think he knows that other people can tell the difference. Which might explain a lot. But he seems to think that everybody thinks that it's actually him on the show.

And then Chris Carter admits the guys based on me, but at least he's a good guy on the show someone know, with this new homeland show and others, I'm out framing innocent Muslims.

That's sort of my he. This is a man who denies the murder of my brother. Yeah. Fuck off. Alex Jones. Yeah, agreed. That's, that's the kind of thing he says is a false flag. But whatever.

And I think it's going to overarch this entire episode. And I part of the reason why I brought up this Sandy Hook tweet. When he said those things. No, he did not have his free speech taken away. Odd. One of the worst things you can probably do or insinuate is that all of these murdered children are fake. Right. And that someone was because what ended up happening was all the family members of these kids got harassed. Yep. And they got they got death threats. The you're part of a massive cover up, right?

At a press conference. The clip doesn't even correspond to what they say. It's like saying, I saw a blue bird in the nest. You look in the tree. There's not even a nest, or there's not even a bird. There's not even a tree folks. Look at that tree. That looks like a mouse for a computer. It's not a tree. Yeah, it is. You're like, No, it's not. You're not even having a logical discussion.
