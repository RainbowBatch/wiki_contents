Today, Dan and Jordan don't want to do it, but they discuss [[Alex Jones]]' recent appearance on the [[Joe Rogan]] podcast. Most of the conversation is about how Alex is a mentally unwell person, but a fair amount is also about how Joe is incredibly stupid and allows Alex to lie to him a bunch. Oh well.
