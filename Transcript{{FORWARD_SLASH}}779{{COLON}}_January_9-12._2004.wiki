And so like, if his connection to that feed gets cut off, the Genesis must start playing the song. Right, right. Yeah, that's how the relay is set. Stop gap. Yeah, I would have brought this up the last time that it happened, because it's so jarring. But it was in that No Man's Land of boring episodes. And his response actually was pretty chill. He laughed at often said that that happens sometimes made it clear that people shouldn't think it was any kind of an attempt to take him off air. Like nowadays, any tech problems. That's a globalist attack, even if it's just the crew playing the wrong clip. So Alex being so cool about a pretty severe tech issue was notable, but not really all that interesting. Yeah. Now we have a second data point. So we have to see how he reacts to this one. Well, it's fine. What do you think, you know, some of the dynamics here? Oh, man, how do you think he's gonna respond?

And there's no one from the phone company outside the office. There's just a black wire strong running right along the side of my office. All right. So that's the connection up to Minnesota and the folks running the show on the satellite. uplinks will maybe have more than one life, have the show today and have Glen Spencer on and to have Joel Skousen, and Keith Parker, and of course, Paul Watson. And if we keep having problems, I'm gonna jump in the car and drive 80 miles an hour to the other studio, oops, never happens once or twice a year, and now it's happening. And I'm beginning to think it's deliberate. In fact, the British media caught it on tape, I'm sorry, about three years ago. They were here in Austin.

Of course, it's super fast and terminal to Lady alna. OB daily reads, citing an Iraqi official, according to the daily the diseases in an advanced state, so doctors predict the former dictator would probably live a couple of years more doctors came out with the fatal diagnosis while making thorough medical checks of Saddam Hussein, that is captured near the hometown to Crete in December 2003. Allegations of Saddam Hussein's illness appeared during the military campaign in Iraq last year, when one of his private doctors residing in Syria claimed that the former dictator suffer from cancer. Oh, how convenient just like, just like in about a week and a half after the announcement, Jack Ruby dropped dead from super fast cancer, kind of like the Shah was fine and got flown into England died real quick of that fast cancer, but I'm sure he really does habit and just the coincidence of guards and guards.

He was going to get a new trial, but it wasn't really a question whether or not he killed Oswald. It was just a matter of whether he acted Premeditatedly. And if his death sentence was appropriate, yeah, the Shah died in 1980. But he'd been diagnosed privately with cancer as early as 1974. Right. As verse Saddam, there's nothing. There's reporting going back to at least 1996 The doctors had been treating him for lymphatic cancer. Then in 2000, there was a string of stories about the reports that Saddam was secretly ill but of course, a lot of this was very difficult to reach any concrete conclusion on opposition forces were often cited as the source of that Intel and the Baghdad embassy would deny the stories which all make sense Right, the opposition would want to paint Saddam has weakened, and the embassy would be concerned about the effect that of disclosing Saddam having cancer. What could that do to the oil market course? It's not clear if he had cancer, and he refused to have a biopsy after he was captured. But it is possible that he did have cancer, because there's definitely a family history. Yeah, sure. He was tried and then executed in 2006. So whatever smarmy bullshit Alex is trying to imply really doesn't make any sense. And it's just another example of how horrible his prediction track record is.

The Op Ed he's talking about as a satirical op ed written by noted humorous Joel Stein, the article launches off from an ADL poll that found that only 22% of Americans thought Jews controlled Hollywood, right. And Joel thought that number was way too low.

    | timestamp = 00:32:33.000
    | text      = The reference to 1965 is about the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which many called the heart cellar act. This Immigration Reform Act got rid of the national origins based quota that was in place previously, much of the ideology for the quota system was based on the then popular ideology of eugenics and was meant to ensure an overwhelming white majority in the US population. Yeah, continuously. Yeah, the new paradigm of immigration admissions was not designed to create a non white majority in the US. In fact, there were attempts to place stipulations in the bill that they thought would limit the ability of the bill to increase non white immigration, there were various little things that were slipped in. But in the end, it turned out there were a lot of people from the eastern hemisphere that were wanting to come here and we're being barred from doing so based on blood quotas. And now that these blood quotas were gone, they were trying to come in to the land of opportunity. Anyway, the reason I bring this up is that it's a really big conspiracy and white nationalist and neo Nazi circles that the Jews plan to use the heart cellar act to bring in masses of non white people to the United States as an attack on the white population. It's a piece that's behind the great replacement ship ideas. Yeah, anyway, this is clearly McDonald's point. And this implicates Glenn Spencer fairly heavily because his primary issue is harassing immigrants at the border. He has no relevance to any public conversation except in terms of immigration issues. So to see his article using Kevin McDonald as a source on how to understand Jewish influence, it's hard to believe that he doesn't also subscribe to some of MacDonald's ideas about the Jewish influence on immigration law. Yeah, my point is that Glen Spencer is at best a white nationalist who used a Joel Stein column he didn't get to justify publishing his own anti semitic Drash all in all pretty perfect guests for Alex Yeah, right on board with the info war.

So I went and I watched this whole speech and the part of the Glenn is using here is wildly out of context. He was talking about how the Mexican government has a duty to help protect the rights of immigrants to the United States from Mexico and how he had just championed legislation to allow immigrants from Mexico to retain their Mexican citizenship, even if they pursue American citizenship. Yeah, that's such a really smart and good Glenn's interpretation of this as an admission that the former Mexican president wanted to use immigrants to re colonize the Southwest is way off base. It's a lesson formed by this speech and more by his flagrant hatred of non white immigrants.

It's lit with special lights and a giant Texas flag flies on the pavilion for Texas independence. And they celebrated that holiday for a long fucking time. Yeah, that sounds right. This is such an awesome story. Okay, in 1896, Jr, law school students at UT Austin, which at that time the entire school had 482 enrolled students. Ah, so these Jr. Law students were pissed that it was a holiday and they still had to be in class. Yeah, so they decided to skip in honor of Texas independence day. The next year, they tried to get the school to officially recognize the holiday and let them out of class. But the then president of the university was from North Carolina and didn't understand dynamics. So the students went and borrowed a cannon that was in front of the state capitol. Sure, which is it's pretty close to campus. If you don't know the geography. Yeah, they brought the cannon to campus where they plan to do a 21 gun salute for Texas independence with one cannon, it would take a while. I'll just read to you how that went from an article on the university's website. Quote, just before sunrise on March 2 The the students arrived for their celebration only to find a large nail had been driven into the ignition hole of the cannon. It took some time and the employment of several pocket knives to remove the item. By then Winston, who's the then president at the school had arrived and was rather unhappy unhappily resigned to the fact that the students were going to celebrate hoping hoping to minimize the damage to the class day Winston asked the laws the law school students sure to move the cannon away from the main building down the hill to the university's athletic field. Or they could wait until after noon to have their fun

Meanwhile, a distracted academic department continued to hold classes as best they could. The laws though weren't going to allow Texas independence day to pass without including the rest of the university. Of course, I 1pm the cannon was positioned in front of the main building facing the Capitol. Sure the first blast quote threatened to break every window in the building. Yep, yeah.

And even that is suspect. The only thing he knows about is the only specific that he ever brings up, which is that rebuilding America's defenses paper. Yeah, if Alex had any actual interest in that document, he would know that at the end of the paper, there's a list of all of the participants in the project meetings that led to the discussions that were then synthesized into this report. Neither training nor Rumsfeld is on that list, but there are names that Alex associates with P neck, so they must be involved in everything that the ship puts out. Yeah. document does not say that Saddam doesn't pose a threat and he's just a useful excuse to go in and get the oil and establish bases to go into Syria and Iran. Alex claims that they say that word for word which isn't even figuratively true. I think what Alex is misrepresenting is this passage from the document, quote, indeed, the United States has for decades sought to play more a more prominent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides an immediate justification, the need for a substantial American presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein. Okay. If you take that sentence in isolation, you may come away with the idea that Saddam is a piece of a larger puzzle. And that's pretty fair to the larger context of the paper, thinking that what the authors are saying is that Saddam isn't a threat and is just a boogeyman used to justify invasion. And plunder requires a reader to bring that preconception to the text itself. It's a practice of Eisah Jesus as opposed to exegesis, where you take the things that are in the text and pull them out. He's engaging in Eisah, Jesus, where you you have your own ideas, and you bring them to the text and experience like that's a good way to engage in like fiction review. And like creative works, you should discuss what the art evokes in you sure, it is not a good way to engage with this.

Syria is only mentioned once in this sentence, quote, according to the CIA, a number of regimes deeply hostile to America, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Syria already have or are developing ballistic missiles that could threaten us allies and forces abroad. That doesn't say they're planning to invade them. No, Orion has mentioned a bit more and often as a potential future adversary.

    | text      = larger point, though here. It's something that I've been stressing a bit lately, because I think it's important, you can make a valid and compelling argument against the worldview and ideas that are expressed in rebuilding America's defenses that document without lying about it. But to do that, you need to do some work, you have to read the document, you have to consider the arguments and formulate responses designed to show that the document itself is shit. That isn't super hard, but it's also not easy. Like it's not something that you can just make up on the fly. And it's also a bit boring for an audience that likes excitement. Yeah, instead of doing any of that stuff, Alex take shortcuts. He makes up more exciting storylines, about the document like that. It's a confession that Saddam wasn't a threat. And it was just about oil. Yeah, he attaches popular, exciting names to the document who have no direction direct connection to it, like Rumsfeld and Cheney. He establishes the document of some giant body of suppose that knowledge he has where he claims he's read a ton of peanut documents, and they're all full of horrors, yet, mysteriously, he's only ever brought up this one. Yeah, Alex takes these shortcuts, because he's not interested in the principle of opposing what's in that document. It's about the aesthetics of being against it, and about using the document to prop up the larger conspiracy worldview that he profits off of, it's important to understand this about his use of primary sources, because again, even if you rightly agree with him, that P neck sucks, you can't trust him to provide any real useful information to help you understand that subject, right? Imagine yourself in a conversation with someone who disagrees with you about this V neck document, if they know what they're talking about. And you repeat some of these claims that Alex has made about the paper, you've lost the debate immediately, you've been equipped with useless and false claims that make it more difficult for you to effectively push back against the agenda that's embodied by the Project for a New American Century, which is a real shame, because Alex pretends he's doing the opposite of that. Yeah, it's it's actually making it harder for you to be an effective person working for change. Right. And that is not not necessarily a coincidence. Like I don't I don't know how much of that is intentional, like disempowering his audience. Yeah, but it feels like he can't not be aware of it

Just like Glen Spencer, who Alex had on the previous day's show foot has decided to be a vigilante and take policing immigration into his own hands. He was the head of a group called ranch rescue which is not at all like Bar Rescue. Instead of yelling at failing bar owners what foot would do is create militarized compounds on people's ranches and wait for immigrants to cross through the property at which point they were apprehended or kidnapped, depending on your perspective, terrorized, generally threatened with death often assaulted, and then turned over to law enforcement. Or at least that last step is what the group would like the story to be since there's no real way to tell if they didn't follow through on some of those death threats. Yeah, there are plenty of unsolved murders of border crossers, and as the ADL is reported, in many cases, when these immigrants have been found murdered, they are bound as if they had been apprehended. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Anyway, Foote may or may not be a murderer, but his group is absolutely in the business of terrorizing immigrants. As luck would have it ranch rescue terrorized the wrong people in March 2003 when they did their usual routine with a group of four Mexican immigrants on March 7, and then with to Salvadorans on March 18. These immigrants went on to sue and a judge ruled in their favor ordering foot to pay $500,000 and turning over possession of the 70 acre ranch. They were operating out of over to the Salvadoran Vic, hey, now that's the shit right? They took ownership of that ranch and had said that they're going to sell it and give the proceeds to immigrant charities. Good Jack foot sucks is group sucks and Alex is making a real pattern of platforming, elevating and promoting people who are actively terrorizing people at the border. He is desperate to to whitewash their associations with legit Nazis like he does here making up that foot must not have known who the National Alliance was the fuck out of here with that shit. Alex knows damn well that this dude knowingly went on that Nazi show. It's just not good for his brand to know that so he lies to the audience to get them to accept this bigot on false pretenses, right? Because he knows that there's at least some of the audience that doesn't want to recognize how closely associated they are with white supremacists and Nazis. Right.

We are conducting phase two of Operation Thunderbird here on private ranch. In Cochise County, Arizona. Your listeners may recall. Cochise County Arizona is the number one illegal border crossing point into the United States and has been for the past five years. On December 20th, our volunteers were conducting reconnaissance patrol, the southern part of our hosts land which is right up next to the border road. Mexican troops armed and in uniforms, OD green uniforms and OD green Kevlar helmet crossed on raw host property. And we're challenged verbally by our reconnaissance team, Mexican troops, there was about 10 of them, we estimate we know for certain there were two in the lead with AK 47 and RPK machine guns. The rest of them retreated back into the work line. And after they got themselves into a concealed position, they fired on our volunteers. Unfortunately, none of our volunteers were hit. I absolutely

It's an imaginary arbitrary line that we all pretend is real. There are some places where it probably could be like, I'm not sure where the line is. Exactly.

    | timestamp = 01:18:20.000
    | text      = Now conversely, if you go on the National Alliance radio show, you're going to be used to perpetuate Nazi shit. Your entire worldview is about how immigrants are an invasion coming into the country to attack the existing white population. And this conversation will be right at home and white supremacist and Nazis circles. You're not going to get a neutral interview there. In fact, you're going to be treated as a hero standing up for the white race. And it should come as no surprise that that's exactly how the National Alliance interview went. He was interviewed by national lions founder and Holocaust denier Kevin Alfred Strom, who was good friends with John Birch Society founding member revealed up all right, also strong went to jail after pleading guilty to possession of child exploitation material in 2008. So cool, great. The interview is downright fawning, and it ends with Strom saying this quote, it's the mission of the National Alliance to make the facts of this invasion and the racial and cultural change it represents known to white Americans and to translate that knowledge into political and social change. enforcing the law is not enough, though we must demand that it be enforced and I wish that ranch rescue was 10,000 times larger than it is now or that Mr. Foote ran the Border Patrol so it was done properly. The only solution that will work is when is white living space until we have our white living space. I'm glad we have men like Jack foot who are working within the system, though that system fights them at every turn to stop these criminals. You can just give me a break with this going on CNN is the same as being celebrated by Nazis bullshit. The only thing that Foote said in that last clip that matters at all is when he said he was aware of the National Alliance and what they believed when he agreed to be on that show. At that point he was consciously using his vigilante ism and almost certainly fake heroic stories about border confrontations to appeal to the white supremacy of their audience.

He said, quote, we fire them up, no warning, no requests. If they're armed and in uniform, and obviously a foreign military unit then we open fire. So strange, almost like he knows how to tailor a different message to different audiences. Also, it's weird how this whole interview with Alex is about protecting America from illegal immigration at the border. But it doesn't come up how ranch rescue has one chapter outside the United States in South Africa. You better believe that comes up on foot his talking with the Nazis though. He even tells them quote, We are facing eventually the same sort of crime wave that was happening in Rhodesia in the 1970s. Oh, weird. Yeah, seems like maybe just maybe these folks are primarily racist vigilantes who like to make their action seem less despicable by pretending they're fighting a defensive battle against the Mexican military, when in reality, most of what they're doing is terrorizing and abusing scared vulnerable immigrants. Yeah.
