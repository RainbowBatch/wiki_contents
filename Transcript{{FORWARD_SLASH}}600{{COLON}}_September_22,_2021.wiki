You know, I grew up in Hawaii and so like. Are there beach plums? Well, some of the time me and my parents, you know, we would go down to Sansusi beach and we would, you know, just break out those plums. It's just an everyday kind of thing. Nom nom nom. No, I know you, you sit at home. It's like one in the afternoon on a Saturday.

There may be something that I just don't know about, but no, it's not bad. I mean, what did you expect? Yeah, no, I mean, it tastes, it tastes about right. We had something that we teased and of course.

I'm still, you know, so Netflix doing a live action Cowboy Bebop remake. Okay. Not sure about how much I'm interested in the live action Cowboy Bebop, considering it was perfect. However, I prefer Cowboy Rocksteady. Nice. Nicely done. Thanks. Cowboy Birth of the Cool Jazz.
