'''Tucker Carlson''' is a right wing pundit and far-right news host, who currently hosts a nightly show on FOX news.

Tucker is sort of like a even more mainstream version of [[David Knight]] -- he says all the same hateful and bigoted things as [[Alex Jones]], but it's packaged in a soft-spoken and respectable seeming way. This has brought Tucker great success as a blatantly racist demagogue, despite his long history as what Alex might derisively call a "neo-con".

Alex frequently sucks up to Tucker (interesting in comparison to his past relationship to [[Glenn Beck]]), presumably because he desperately wants access to Tucker's easy-to-radicalize audience. Tucker has several times carried water for Alex and InfoWars.

One of Tucker's "Documentaries" was covered in Episode [[614: The Purge of Gates]].
