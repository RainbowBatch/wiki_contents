Some animals like ones that zoos have been given a COVID vaccine, but it's not the same one that's given to people and it doesn't use mRNA. That being said, there are a number of vaccines for animals that use RNA platforms. And that's been the case for many years. owners have discretion over which vaccines they want to give or not give their livestock and there's currently no mRNA vaccines that are licensed for use on animals. I can't stress this enough Alex's reporting all this is confirmed based on like a meme or a headline from some conspiracy shithead social media or blog. Yeah, and all of this seems to trace back to anti Vax legend, Dr. Mercola, who is complaining about a pig vaccine called liquidity, which isn't even an mRNA vaccine, and it isn't even a vaccine. So liquidity is a platform that Merck created that allows them to use RNA technology to rapidly create vaccines for pigs. The end result is a live model, modified live virus vaccine. But because the platform itself uses RNA technology, anti Vax folks, see those letters and then just decide that this is mRNA, which means that it's the same thing as the COVID vaccine just means the COVID vaccine predates the pandemic. It's really lazy stuff and reporting on this without having a basic understanding of what you're talking about is it's really an exploitation of the audience on Alex's part, yeah,

Biden is the top first choice with 25% of the vote after that is Bernie with 17 and Michelle Obama with 10%. Some interesting choices like AOC, come in at like 4%. And then RFK, Jr. is polling at about 2%. Things get worse for him. When you look at the data for second choice candidates, Pete Buttigieg, and Michelle Obama topped that list with 17 and 16%, respectively, and RFK, Jr, sitting at 1%. The poll also found that RFK Jr has the second highest rate of unfavorability among likely Democratic voters beaten only by Marianne Williamson, which seems a little surprising. I don't know what she did to make everyone hate her. Oh, she sucks. I'm sure she does. But that much. She just thought of unfavorability Yeah, she just suck. All right.

But mostly because it's a really embarrassing episode of television. It's entirely about the Bilderberg Group who apparently Rima now thinks are just middle management, right. And the show relies on the testimony of complete lunatics like Daniel estulin, and editors of Nazi publications like Big Jim Tucker share. I am David Icke is in there, too. I could see someone not wanting to retire this not because it's so dangerous to the man but because it's a bunch of shit. I went back and I watched this episode. And man, there is no other word for it than embarrassing. It's so overly dramatized. And Jesse is clearly just going through the motions. But one thing that I thought was interesting was that when Reema is being interviewed, she tells her story about treating the head of state. Apparently this happened in 2002. And it was a female head of state who was not Queen Elizabeth and not queen bee. Okay. She specifically says All right, okay. There were very few female heads of state in 2000. To say that seems reasonable. Yeah. The prime minister of Satomi and presepe, who was a woman, I can tell you that and the Prime Minister and Governor General of New Zealand. Sure. Those are women. Of course, if I had to guess she might be talking about the then Prime Minister of Panama, Mariela mus. Masako mosque, Kosovo.

In the real world, Marburg was identified in 1967, and has killed way more than four people. There was an ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 to 2000, which led to 128 deaths 83% of the people who contracted it, then, between 2004 and 2005, there was an outbreak in Angola that killed 227 People 90% of those who caught it, Jesus frequently, these outbreaks will begin with mineworkers who go down into areas that are infested with bats, and then they may spread it to family members. A lot of the time, there doesn't end up being a large, wide community spread, which isn't something I can find a good explanation for. And honestly might come down to sunblock. Yeah, some of these cases. Yeah. Marburg is bad news. It is like Ebola, and there is no known treatment for it. Just because we've seen a few small pockets of cases abroad, doesn't mean that we should panic, though. But it's wise for medical professionals to keep an eye on those kinds of things. Be aware of the situation, you know, relay information responsibly. It is, you know, something that places maybe Hey, keep your eye out. If there's any symptoms that look like this be aware head on the swivel doctors. Yeah, but like, it's not something that outside of worlds like Alex and these, these shitheads, I don't know, if I see people throwing a bunch of panic around,
