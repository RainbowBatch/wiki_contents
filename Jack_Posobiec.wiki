'''Jack Posobiec''' is a Trump-hack "journalist" who also [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-jack-posobiecya-busted seriously pushed the idea that Pizzagate was a sex dungeon in the non-existent basement of Comet Ping Pong Pizza]. He was outed as being in "military intelligence," but in reality what that meant was that he was doing piss tests on Marines. Jack has had his hands in far too many fraudulent media propaganda campaigns (Macron Leaks, the "Rape Melania" sign, etc) to detail all of them. Alex treats him as if he is some kind of expert on international relations, which is hilarious. Jack really sucks.
