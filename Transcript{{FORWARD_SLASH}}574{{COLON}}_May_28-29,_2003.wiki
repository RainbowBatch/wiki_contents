The position he's putting forth is absolutely the definition of not having a position. There are a lot of reasons to be for or against the death penalty. Some can be based on an emotional appeal, you know, like people who commit certain crimes deserve death. Some can be based on a utilitarian calculation, where you determine that if you have a death penalty, there's actually a significant effect on crime rates, and you make a decision based on the death penalty.

Still, other positions can be based on ethics, where there's an intrinsic moral character dissenting someone to death, and that consideration guides your position.
