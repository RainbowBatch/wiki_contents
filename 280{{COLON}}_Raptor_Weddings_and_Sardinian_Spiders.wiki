Today, Dan and Jordan take a detour into Project Camelot world to go over the latest entry in the saga of Sweary Kerry's interviews with Mark Richards, a convicted murderer who likes to pretend he's a space warrior. In this installment, Kerry actually discusses Mark's crime, which is a bad move, since it kind of opens the door for Dan and Jordan to do the same.
