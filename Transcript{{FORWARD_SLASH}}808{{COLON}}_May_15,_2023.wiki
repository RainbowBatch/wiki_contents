It was a fun joke about how he wasn't gay, I guess. So Jared left the show in 2018, and there's not really a good answer as to why he left. However, a lot of former employees of Crowder have come out lately and talked about how he has a bullying and abusive workplace environment that may have contributed to Jarrods departure. One such employee told the New York Post that Crowder exposed himself multiple times to Jared at work, and another of Crowder's ex employees and current Nazi Owen Benjamin, he said that Crowder was miserable to work for and wasn't good about paying the staff. Jared appears to be a soft target for someone like Alex or Stephens, current co host to poke fun at because he's not one of the named former staffers who's coming out against Steven. So there's probably less blowback they have to worry about, because it's clear that at this point, it seems like he's respecting, like, whatever actual or sort of respect based NDA or whatever, you know, like he's, he doesn't want to talk shit or whatever.

    | text      = that shit all that time where Alex was whining about people calling him a white supremacist and rambling about how white supremacy isn't a real problem. This is who he has on as a guest. He has noted white nationalist Peter Brimelow, the head of one of the most celebrated publications among white supremacists V dare. That's a very good illustration of irony. Vt air is named after Virginia Dare who said to be the first British child born in what is now the United States. She was born in the Roanoke colony in 1587. And if you know your early colonial history, you'll know that this colony straight up disappear Krell Atala, no one knows what happened to it. And there's no concrete evidence to support any of the theories surrounding its fate. However, one of the prominent theories is that the local Chesapeake tribe I believe, no, that's not right. It was another tribe. I apologize, I got that wrong. But one of the prominent theories is that they were killed by one of these tribes, which is part of the basis for why Virginia Dare has become an important signifier among white nationalist and white supremacist groups. You can see why this image has resonance for that kind of community with their obsession of their own persecution for being white. Sure. To be clear, there is another version of memorializing Virginia that does happen among non white nationalists. And she's kind of a symbol of new beginnings and the possibilities that began with the first child born in the colonies. But it's important to understand that this is not the legacy that V dare celebrate. Yeah, they are definitely in the whiteness business. As Brembo himself has said, quote, I pick the name because I wanted to focus attention on the very specific cultural origins of America, at a time when mass non traditional immigration is threatening to swamp it. I have to say that I was a little surprised by this booking, particularly given the earlier tone of the episode, but it's not that much of a shock. The rest of the episode honestly is predictably, Alex and Brimelow. Exchanging. What about two white genocide fears? Yeah, about immigration back

It was nowhere near as bad as this, but it was very substantial. And about a million and a half illegals left in the 1950s. They only has to deploy to about 100.

Yeah. Does that does not not bring. Over a million people were deported to Mexico, many of them who are American citizens who are caught up in dragnet set out to capture immigrants. Yeah, incalculable damage was done to Mexican American communities who were terrorized and disrupted. People who were deported were often left in areas where they were completely unfamiliar with their surroundings and had no food or water. In one case that was referenced by NPR, there was a round up and 112 degree heat that resulted in Ada deaths. After a few months, the program ended with the government declaring victory and saying that the border was secure. But in reality, all they had done is terrorize a non white population. Some have said that mass deportations like this constitute acts of ethnic cleansing, since they involve the forcible removal of people based on ethnicity. And Brimelow supports that. So I mean, you can kind of see where he's at. Yeah, I wonder if Brimelow wants his imagined revoking of birthright citizenship to be retroactive. That would get messy really fast. And that's where I was thinking about this idea of like, if people who are born in the US Yeah, are you gonna, quote unquote, illegal? Yeah. Then who is legal?
