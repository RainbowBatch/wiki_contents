Today, Dan and Jordan trace the beginning of the week on The Alex Jones Show. In this installment, Alex deals with the fallout of the release of Millie Weaver's "documentary" ShadowGate, pretends that it's totally cool that Roger Stone dropped his super-important appeal, and goes all-in on Laura Loomer's congressional campaign.
