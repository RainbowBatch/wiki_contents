'''Norm Pattis''' is a Connecticut attorney who has represented [[Alex Jones]] in the [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|Connecticut Sandy Hook Case]]<ref>https://www.normpattis.com/</ref>. He filed a Pro Hac Vice to represent Alex in [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|Texas as well]], but that was denied.

Norm has been on Alex's show as a guest many times. Perhaps most notably, Norm was on air with Alex when Alex threatened and put a bounty on [[Chris Mattei]].

During [[InfoW et. al. Bankruptcy Case|Alex's ill-fated bankruptcy diversion]], Norm kinda messed things up by explicitly stating that the bankruptcy was an attempt to force a settlement<ref>https://www.wsj.com/articles/infowars-alex-jones-seeks-to-leverage-small-business-bankruptcy-law-11650579228</ref>. This was quoted during arguments and motions to support dismissal.

In recent court hearings, Norm has sent [[Cam Atkinson]] to represent Alex instead. Norm recently made an unsuccessful attempt to stop representing Alex, claiming that he had been unable to directly contact his client for months. After [[Judge Barbara Bellis]] refused to allow him to withdraw so close to trial without a hearing, Norm withdrew his attempt. While Atkinson has since repeated his request to withdraw, Norm stated in a mid July hearing that he or his partner Kevin Smith will be lead counsel for the trial<ref>https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=23170866 page 28</ref>. He has maintained that he is unable to directly contact his client, which is why he has asked for TX lawyer [[Andino Reynal]] to join Jones' CT legal team.

== Norm's Stand-up Career ==
Norm seems to have an ill-advised passion for stand-up comedy.

Episode #549: April 13-14, 2021 first documented Norm's attempts to ply his comedic wares on Alex's shows. Norm made an extremely clunky joke about how the modern person needed "Woke Insurance" so that if the woke masses came after them they'd be protected from consequence.

In March of 2022, Norm made a extremely racist stab at stand-up, appearing at a comedy event in East Haven, Connecticut with his pants around his ankles, and trying to do George Carlin's "7 dirty words" bit, but with racial slurs (including the N-word) instead<ref>https://youtu.be/i5reSvkQq7k</ref><ref>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alex-jones-attorney-norm-pattis-n-word-pants-down-standup-set_n_6261a37fe4b07c34e9de3f23</ref>.

Not even the courtroom is safe from Norm's questionably honed wit. In a July 2022 status conference in the [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|Lafferty Case]], Norm attempted to joke that because plaintiffs wanted to bring first aid supplies (e.g. bandages) into the courtroom, he might need to "notify [his] insurance carrier of a risk of potential physical harm here"<ref>https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=23170866 page 16</ref>. This landed about as well as you would expect, with [[Judge Barbra Bellis|Judge Bellis]] responding "Iâ€™m not sure what to say to that." and [[Chris Mattei|Attorney Mattei]] replying "No.".
