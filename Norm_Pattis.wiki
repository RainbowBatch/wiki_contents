[[File:Norm Pattis.jpg|thumb]]
'''Norm Pattis''' is a Connecticut attorney who has represented [[Alex Jones]] in the [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|Connecticut Sandy Hook Case]]<ref>https://www.normpattis.com/</ref>. He filed a Pro Hac Vice to represent Alex in [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|Texas as well]], but that was denied.

Pattis represented [[Candace Owens]] in her (just) suit against her high school, where she was subjected to racist harassment<ref>https://www.thehour.com/norwalk/article/Schools-pay-37-500-to-Owens-family-8240741.php</ref>. Before going completely off the deep-end alongside Owens, Pattis in fact had a high-profile and fairly successful career as a defense and civil right attorney.

Norm has been on Alex's show as a guest many times. Perhaps most notably, Norm was on air with Alex when Alex threatened and put a bounty on [[Chris Mattei]].

During [[InfoW et. al. Bankruptcy Case|Alex's ill-fated bankruptcy diversion]], Norm messed things up by explicitly stating that the bankruptcy was an attempt to force a settlement<ref>https://www.wsj.com/articles/infowars-alex-jones-seeks-to-leverage-small-business-bankruptcy-law-11650579228</ref>. This was quoted during arguments and motions to support dismissal.

In pre-trial court hearings, Norm has sent [[Cam Atkinson]] to represent Alex instead. Norm and Cam made a last-ditch unsuccessful attempt to stop representing Alex, claiming that he had been unable to directly contact his client for months. After [[Judge Barbara Bellis]] refused to allow him to withdraw so close to trial without a hearing, Norm withdrew his attempt. While Atkinson later successfully withdrew, Norm remained lead counsel for the trial<ref>https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=23170866 page 28</ref><ref>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/jury-hears-closing-arguments-in-alex-jones-sandy-hook-trial</ref>.

Norm still claimed that he was unable to directly contact his client, and he asked for TX lawyer [[Andino Reynal]] to join Jones' CT legal team. While the judge partially granted this request, once it became clear that Reynal would not have a speaking role at trial, Reynal withdrew as well.

Norm represented Alex during the Connecticut trial, at one point falling asleep during proceedings<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alex-jones-lawyer-connecticut-trial-b2168406.html</ref>. The eventual verdict against Alex exceeded 1 billion dollars. Norm's license to practice law was suspended for 6 months because of Norm's part in sending the plaintiffs medical records to non-authorized parties (although that suspension was later stayed pending appeal<ref>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/court-stays-norm-pattis-law-license-suspension-17778556.php</ref>).

Norm represented former-[[InfoWars]] employee and [[Proud Boys]] leader [[Joe Biggs]] during his months-long Seditious Conspiracy trial (arising from Biggs conduct and planning related to the [[January 6th Insurrection]]<ref>https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/prosecutors-rest-sedition-case-proud-boys-leaders-97986731</ref>. It may not surprise you to learn that Biggs was found guilty of Seditious conspiracy and fiver other felonies<ref>https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23800942-804-official-jury-verdict</ref>.

== Norm's Stand-up Career ==

Norm seems to have an ill-advised passion for stand-up comedy.

Episode #549: April 13-14, 2021 first documented Norm's attempts to ply his comedic wares on Alex's shows. Norm made an extremely clunky joke about how the modern person needed "Woke Insurance" so that if the woke masses came after them they'd be protected from consequence.

In March of 2022, Norm made a extremely racist stab at stand-up, appearing at a comedy event in East Haven, Connecticut with his pants around his ankles, and trying to do George Carlin's "7 dirty words" bit, but with racial slurs (including the N-word) instead<ref>https://youtu.be/i5reSvkQq7k</ref><ref>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alex-jones-attorney-norm-pattis-n-word-pants-down-standup-set_n_6261a37fe4b07c34e9de3f23</ref>.

Not even the courtroom is safe from Norm's questionably honed wit. In a July 2022 status conference in the [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|Lafferty Case]], Norm attempted to joke that because plaintiffs wanted to bring first aid supplies (e.g. bandages) into the courtroom, he might need to "notify [his] insurance carrier of a risk of potential physical harm here"<ref>https://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=23170866 page 16</ref>. This landed about as well as you would expect, with Judge Barbara Bellis responding "I'm not sure what to say to that." and Attorney Chris Mattei replying "No.".
