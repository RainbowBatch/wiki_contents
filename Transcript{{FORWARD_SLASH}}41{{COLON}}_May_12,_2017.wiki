I laid in bed last night for about three hours with an iPad, reading news and watching video clips that I got up at about 6am this morning and research for a couple hours. And then I got back to work and went over the latest news. And my head is just spinning. Because of the Johnnie Walker, the producers walked in he goes, this is gonna be an incredible show today.

    | text      = I gotta be honest, it is incredible. Okay, but not in the way that Matt thinks. Also, throughout the course of this episode, we're gonna find that Alex Jones did no research. He might have been up till three reading Breitbart articles or something like that, but that he did no research at all. It's this is gonna be so fun.

    | timestamp = 03:29
    | text      = Traditional crashes melt down on the government. This is amazing. And I'm just like, yeah, no, it's amazing. Amazing how good Trump is commissioned to expose election fraud. The Democrats are openly getting illegals to vote mass pimps coming out and said Men if there's genocide against Christians, hundreds of 1000s a year being killed. Nobody would say that just a year ago. US Steel coming roaring back us. Us dry goods. US finished goods. So many good numbers, but then you juxtapose it with all the bad numbers. And we are in the best of times, worst of times, I open the broadcast so many times with that statement, and then stuff like this. I watched this seven and a half minute GQ rant by Keith Oberman. And I watched it very, very carefully. Let me tell you, a woman didn't do this as a stunt.

    | text      = He didn't he didn't do that. Did he do it as a job? Perhaps he might have done it as a job. Yeah. But so here's what's great. He lays out all these stories that he ostensibly wants to get to in depth. And, look, none of them are real. No. Christians are. We're gonna get into this as the thing goes along. He's making the argument that Christians are the most persecuted group in the world. And that Pence came out and said that hundreds of 1000s are killed a year. I don't think he said that. Nor is that true. It's not true. I don't care Pam said it or not, it's 100% not true, of course. And the premise that no one would have said it a year ago isn't true. Because there's like World Net Daily articles for the past five years saying, yeah, not all verbally unsourced. Every

And I actually found a pretty interesting article, because he goes on to and I can't remember if it's in this clip, or a little bit later, I think I think it's here. But so he talks about how the UN admits the Christians are the most persecuted group in the world. Now. They don't, they don't. But I looked into it. And I found on un.org a really interesting article from 2011 that talks about the Christian persecution of Christians. And I think that's the only thing that could be going on making that claim. And here I'll read the headline to you. You are

And he went on to say that the particular influence of a specific religion in a nation should never imply that citizens belonging to other faiths should be discriminated against in social life, or even worse, that violence against them should be tolerated.

And the free market sucks. Yeah. So

So that does make me think of that, like, every religion always polls that like, Oh, we're getting persecuted. I am less interested in how many people are getting persecuted than the net persecution rate? Sure. See what I'm saying? Sure. Sure. Like if Christians are persecuting more than getting persecuted, you don't get to you don't get to count. You know, if it's the other way, then everybody cares about you. It's an

    | text      = Absolutely. All of that goes to this other thing that he was saying, like when he's talking about dry goods and finished goods, right. He's basically I think, trying to insinuate the what Trump tweeted out the other day about how China is going to start letting us sell things to them again. Yeah.

And then of course, it gets to at the end, what he really wants to talk about just Keith by the fucking Oberman, of course. So Keith Olbermann had put out a video where he sort of says, all of the intelligence agencies around the world they were in a crisis, and the time has come, that we need everything to come out in the open, because eventually, you won't be able to write this, this is going to be too entrenched. Yeah, this is going to become a thing where time is of the essence. I am not here to defend Keith Olbermann, either, am I I don't think he has a terrible point there. But at the same time, you really open yourself up to attack when you say, hey, foreign agencies, spill the beans on our president. Yeah, I

I hope some second amendment people take care of you. Hmm. Right. You can imply that was a very direct threat. Sure. But if you go to court for it, can't you just be like he said it? I'm quoting him. Yeah, exactly. So if you want to prosecute me, that means he's on the prosecution too.

It wasn't 19% stake in the 30. Like, I can't remember the precise figure but it's in the trillions of dollars. Oh, then they stood the game billions of dollars. Yeah. Cuz it's, it has to do with the fucking the embargoes on oil in Russia, right. It's expansive oil fields that they're not using? Because they can't, right. So opening that up would stand to make people like Rex Tillerson and the conspirators? Yeah. tons of money. Yeah. So that that makes sense as a motivation. That's very simple. So

When Palmer began to work there on the Orsini, it was called the geese house, and it was protected under preservation laws, there are plans in place to move the house to Angelino heights, but Palmer's workers demolished it. Instead, their excuse a bulldozer had accidentally backed into it, making it unsavable. It gets even more screwed up, though, when the city suggested it might hold Palmer accountable for his actions. He sued the city. In the end, he only had to pay $200,000 and provided some public mitigations Jesus, which basically, the public medications that we can find are that all of his amenities are private. So basically, he has outward facing homes. Yeah, so like, if you walk down the street, it's just the facade of a building. But then interiorly there'll be like a pool and a courtyard and shit like that. He has one building that has a fountain that is accessible to the public. And so that is his public mitigates this.

According to La magazine, affordable housing advocates often blame that decision. The one that yeah, the Palmer was responsible for it. Yep. When they point to the paucity of low income housing downtown. So he's actively, you know, hurting the ability of people to get apartments. Yeah, Palmer's properties are according to Palmer's company. 95% full rents range from about $2,000 to about $5,000. But the tenants don't actually seem to like it their quote, There are consistent complaints about trash and property damage around the premises, about the noise from other tenants, many are students and about what people describe as lakhs oversights. His company actually has its own management subsidiary that runs the building, so it's all his fault. Also, someone had emailed this article, and they made an update, that the Palmer's buildings are also magnets for break ins, far more than any other downtown buildings.

Such waivers are typically issued when the administration wants to allow a new political appointee or employee to work on an issue like federal housing or environmental policy that involves people the new employee may have worked with previously. For example, Ernest J. Morin's, the energy secretary in the Obama administration was allowed to work on matters that involve General Electric even though Mr. Manas as a nuclear physicist had served on a General Electric advisory board about 70 Such waivers were issued during the Obama administration. Mr. Trump, in his ethics order made several fundamental changes in this process, some of which Mr. Shaw is challenging. First, Mr. Trump eliminated a prohibition imposed by Barack Obama in 2009. On the hiring of staff members who had in the previous two years had lobbied the agency they now wanted to work for former lobbyist seeking jobs and Mr. Trump's administration administration must get a waiver from the ethics rules if they want to work on matters that overlap with their lobbying assignments in the previous two years. But ah, there's a but Mr. Trump has chosen to keep the waivers secret. He dropped a practice in place during the Obama administration that any waiver would be shared with the Office of governmental ethics and posted on the White House website or the Ethics Office website or on both the combined result eliminating the ban on hiring former lobbyist and keeping secret any waivers granted to new hires means the public has no way of knowing if Mr. Trump's staff are complying with the rules

In the mid 1980s, North Korea reached a, quote, dangerous level of nuclear capacity with advancements due to increased Soviet support for their nuclear program right in 1990. Or I'm sorry, 1984. North Korea completed construction of a five megawatt I don't think that's correct, and MW gigawatt x m W E, five MWe gas cooled graphite moderated nuclear reactor for plutonium production. If operating at full power for a majority of the year, the reactor could produce 7.5 kilograms of weapons grade plutonium annually. There is still great disagreement as to just how much plutonium was produced. That was in 1984, those 33 years ago. So Alex is holding this narrative about the Clintons gave them their reactors, right. Everything was already there way in advance. China and North Korea both had Soviet help, obviously, it was an offshoot of the Korean War. It's it's what the fuck? This is such stupid shit.

    | text      = No, based on the statistics that have been able to being gathered 50.7% of refugees are women. So your number is already fucked. How many are children? Well, here's the thing that I'm going to quote. It is true that the refugee demographics do skew on the side of youth. Syria, in particular, as a country with a large population of young people between income, especially in comparison to Europe, the majority of Syrians are between 25 and 54 years old, and only 4.02% of Syria's population is older than 65. Compared to the European Union 18.5. If refugee and migrant populations follow their originating countries demographics, then we should expect to see that at least half of Syrian and other refugees will be male, and most of them will be young. To put the issue of age into perspective, as of 2015, Syria's median age was 23.8 racks was 19.7. And Afghanistan was 18.4. By comparison, the median age in the United States was 37.7. In the United Kingdom, it was 40.4. And Germany was 46.5. Children from Syria and elsewhere make up at least a third of the refugee population. Children who, whether accompanied or alone are looking for a chance to grow up in a country that is not shredded by violence. Now, if you want to really break it down, the reason that the population is so, so obvious, the life expectancy is terrible. Yeah.

Until getting way closer to that now, in terms of like, you don't see it on the show, but he just admitted the last time he talked about Oberman, he was throwing shit, right during the breaks. Now, I would also I would also those sort of outbreaks are probably happening more than just when he listens to fucking cold, cold bear or cold. Herman if you will? Well, I mean, the both of them, they can bear man. And if he's exhibiting those sorts of behaviors, and I'm being a bit speculative here, I don't think he is right to be around his kids. Like if he has that kind of, like hair trigger. Yeah. That just something he disagrees with will send him into a rage where he breaks things, right. That's not someone who can be trusted around growing humans.
