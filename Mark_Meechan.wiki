'''Mark Meechan''' (aka '''Count Dankula''') is an idiot from the UK who got in trouble because he posted a video of himself training his dog to give a Hitler Salute when he said "Sieg Heil" or other extremely anti-Semitic things (which trigger the Fandom content filter if reproduced)<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/20/march-20-2018 Official wiki notes for March 20, 2018], reproduced with permission.</ref>.

On March 20th, 2018, he was found guilty in a Scottish court of having committed a hate crime<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pug-nazi-salute-youtube-video-owner-guilty-hate-crime-mark-meechan-lanarkshire-a8265301.html</ref>. [[141: March 20-22, 2018|The same day he appeared]] on [[InfoWars]].

The issue is that in the UK, "the first amendment" as we understand it does not exist, and if you say things that are intentionally inflammatory, you can be held accountable for the results of your actions, so Alex and Mark do not really have a leg to stand on. Mark's defense hinged on his insistence that he had trained his dog to do this, and made the video, to annoy his girlfriend, but that sort of implies that his girlfriend (or Mark himself) says Nazi stuff enough that she would even notice. If neither of them ever said shit like that, there's no real payoff to this as a prank. Oh, also, Mark is on the show along with noted career criminal/con man/anti-Muslim agitator [[Tommy Robinson]], so his credibility as a "not racist person" is in the toilet.
