[[Jim Bakker]] is an American televangelist, former Assemblies of God minister, and convicted felon. He rose to fame in the 1970s and 1980s as the host of ''The PTL Club'', a Christian television program that he co-founded with his wife, [[Tammy Faye Bakker]].

Bakker's ministry was embroiled in scandal in the late 1980s, when he was accused of raping a church secretary and fraud involving the sale of time-share units at his Heritage USA Christian theme park. Bakker resigned from the PTL Club and was eventually convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges, resulting in a 45-year prison sentence. His sentence was later reduced to 8 years on appeal, and he was released from prison in 1994 after serving five years.

Following his release from prison, Bakker returned to televangelism and founded a new ministry, Morningside Church, and a new show ''the Jim Bakker Show''. His show has been criticized for promoting doomsday scenarios and peddling a range of controversial and sometimes fraudulent products, including survival food buckets, silver solution as a cure for diseases, and other dubious health products. The show is a frequent topic on [[Wacky Wednesday]] episodes, since Bakker will have just about any crazy person on if they'll help him sell his junk.

Bakker has also been criticized for his vocal support of former President [[Donald Trump]] and his promotion of conspiracy theories related to the [[Covid-19]] pandemic, including claims that the pandemic was a hoax and that the virus could be cured with the products he sells on his show.
