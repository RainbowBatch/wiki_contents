And so this happened after Alex was off air on Thursday on the 30th. And so he didn't have a chance to respond to it on air. It actually happened while Owen was on air during the War Room. And so we get a little taste of his response to it. But Alex put out a video that evening, of course, that I can only describe as the definition of phoning it in. Oh, yeah. It's his standing in front of a camera and as opposed to being at his desk screaming but we gotta go live show. There used to be a time when he would be like, fuck it. I'm drunk. We are doing a two hour show right now. Yeah, this is too big to miss. Now we'll just like sit and sit in front of the fucking map trying to rip off Paul Joseph Watson.

I think that we find so often that whenever there's the expectation that Alex is going to do something, it's kind of a disappointment, like when he's gonna respond to something big. It's kind of like blew it fizzles. Yeah. And then often he disappears. Yes, yes, he does immediately go far away. And that happens here too. Of course. So it's, it's a mess. It's a mess.

By knows Biden's a pedophile and his son's a pedophile of Chinese agents, 100 laptop and all of it. I can sit back I know the enemy's playbook, there is no way without them shutting off truck bombs and blaming it on us. Or a mass shootings or a race attack or something that this is going to work for them. So I see the next card being staged violence be blamed on us. A you agree with that and be how do we get ahead of that and stop that because we're winning? We forced them to engage in this open Banana Republic behavior, which is blowing up further so or am I missing something here?

And there were plenty of other trips between then and 2005. And article about their connection in Gawker is so goddamn funny. After all, the logs came out and his connection to this very powerful, very evil child predator was made public.
