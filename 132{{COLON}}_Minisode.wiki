Today, Dan and Jordan have a little episode for you where they discuss Alex Jones' interview with Jalen Martin, a student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Alex's actions in the aftermath of this tragedy, as well as after pretty much every tragedy, are pretty formulaic and uninteresting, but this interview manages somehow to transcend in the arena of distastefulness.
