Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened during Alex Jones' 8 PM shift during his recent "Help Me I'm Being Sued" Marathon. It's a classic esoteric performance by a drunk Alex, covering such diverse topics as "how Alex is a victim because of the lawsuits against him" and "how Alex is a victim because the listeners of his show don't give him enough money." Definitely high end political talk.
