Today, Dan and Jordan enjoy a Wacky Wednesday adventure where they revisit the world of Coach Dave, specifically a couple of interviews he did with anti-Clinton propagandist and former Knowledge Fight guest Larry Nichols. The interviews happen around the 2016 election, so they mostly involve Larry saying profoundly dumb stuff and unabashedly advocating for "veterans" and "biker gangs" to intimidate voters at inner city precincts.
