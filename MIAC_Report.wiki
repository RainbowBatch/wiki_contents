The '''MIAC (Missouri Information Analysis Center) Report''' is an intelligence assessment document that was issued by the Missouri State Highway Patrol in February 2009<ref>https://www.privacylives.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/miacreport_022009.pdf</ref>. The report was intended to provide law enforcement agencies with information about potential threats from domestic extremist groups, but it quickly drew criticism from groups who saw it as an attempt to demonize militias. The Missouri State Highway Patrol initially defended the report as a legitimate intelligence assessment, but later withdrew it and issued an apology.

Unfortunately, violent events such as the [[January 6th Insurrection]], Bundy ranch standoff, and an escalating series of domestic terror attacks against racial minorities and power infrastructure have proven the MIAC Report's concerns to be valid. The report identified several militia movement and sovereign citizen groups as potential threats, and warned that they could recruit new members by exploiting social and political upheaval, which is basically exactly what happened.

Alex and InfoWars have use the MIAC Report as a foil for years.
