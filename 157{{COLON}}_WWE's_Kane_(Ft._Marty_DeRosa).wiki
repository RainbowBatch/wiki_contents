Today, Dan tells "Fill In Jordan" Marty DeRosa about how in 2013, Alex Jones did an interview with WWE's own Kane (aka Glen Jacobs). The gents discuss how stupid libertarianism is at its core, how weird it is that "The Devil's Favorite Demon" was a guest on devil-fearing Alex's show, and how great the soundtrack of Josie And The Pussycats was.
