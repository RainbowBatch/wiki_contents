Today, Dan tells Jordan all about the January 21, 2009 episode of [[The Alex Jones Show]]. Barack Obama has been president for exactly one day, and Alex is already way off board with the idea of giving him a chance. Alex spends most of the show poorly parsing Obama's inauguration speech, then welcomes two complete weirdo guests to spice things up.
