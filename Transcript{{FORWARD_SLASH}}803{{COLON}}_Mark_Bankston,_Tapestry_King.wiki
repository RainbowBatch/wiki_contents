There's bankruptcy judge, the US Trustee is subchapter five trustee, individual attorneys for every corporate entity attorneys. For the families in Connecticut, the attorneys for down here, there's the attorneys for the universal, the unified creditors. I mean, there are so many damn people involved, that for a trial lawyer, it's a weird feeling, because I am now just a very small part of this, like I am not.

It just, you just can't go boom, poof, right. Like, it's not fairy dust stuff going on there. And so you really do have to drill down, you really have to do all of these things. And it is like pulling teeth. But but the teeth are getting old. Right? I don't. I've always said and I continue to say I don't know exactly how this ends. But but it's ending. And it's not in a way that Jones likes like, this is not good. There's no There's no version of how this plays out. That is like really good for Jones. There's only a version of it, in which it doesn't, he's not a guy in a barrel with suspenders. Like he has a life skill. And he, he has the ability to have a career and make money and all that kind of stuff.

I'm speaking of this in the 50,000 foot view of how does this play on traditional bankruptcy strategy, things like that, in terms of on the ground, what a bankruptcy plan, even like 90% of what's in a bankruptcy plan would be like trying to get me to understand a manual and brain surgery. Like that's a different language. Like, I'm not qualified to even have opinions on that. Right. So what and even the questions of ultimately, what happens to the parties like like, how is our arm? Because the question is, is how to best guard the interest of the debtors, while at the same time maximizing the recovery to the creditors like it's supposed to do that. Often those two things are going to be in conflict, and you don't know which one's going to give right. So there's so many different ways of bankruptcy planning could take it could be implemented. And it would depend on the on also the amount of assets and, and whether some of those are legally exempt and what the parties decide the debts are dischargeable because you have to remember, you're still just talking about Jones and free speech systems in bankruptcy. There are other entities in the mix, too. There are fraudulent conveyance lawsuits out there. This thing is a giant complicated ball of wax. And so I I have learned that it has now entered a tariff.

And then if he appeals that order to the Court of Appeals and loses, he has to pay another $55,000 And if he appeals that order to the Texas Supreme Court and loses then he is paying another $62,000.

I've never seen a six figure sanction against an attorney like that. I've seen it against like a law firm like and there's like, say you got a case like Apple versus Samsung, and you've got two mega law firms going against each other. And one like, seriously covers up evidence or substrate like you can get a million dollar sanction against that law firm for all of the legal work that occurred over the course of years, right? Or hell, in this case, right when Jones hit his like fifth sanction, and the court was like, alright, well screw it, you don't have to pay for any of the discovery you've ever undertaken in this case. And so that was a million dollar instant sanctions that Jones paid. But with Reynaldo paths pay $100,000, you know, like, and if he, if he appeals and messes up, he could be looking at close to a quarter million out of his pocket. And in some cases, it is a lot.

So if there's a bankruptcy and and Dino is not working, basically, then he doesn't get paid. But then, so when he comes back, though, then he gets paid another $100,000 for the month. So we know that for when he was retained in in march up until April with the bankruptcy. There's 100,000 Right there. And then it comes back.

And it was, it was wonderful to be there and see Neil and Scarlets ability to stand up to him and what have you. But Alex decided to try and steal that a little bit with his story that he told about Scarlet crying, and telling him that he was right about everything. And recently, we discovered an apology video that he put out that you featured prominently in or a letter that you sent him was featured in this, and I wanted to ask you about it because this was not something that I felt really got publicized at all. I'm not saying that's like, shortcoming on you or anything. But like, I pay attention to Alex quite a bit. And it wasn't something that was in the news. Nope. Didn't see anybody tweeting about it.

But, but so I sort of give some background here. I don't know. Do you want me to lay this out? Yeah, please, please. Okay, so So as as you know, what went on the trial essentially, was there was a period where Jones went on his show, and said, You know what, maybe I think I was probably wrong about Neil hustlin Neale Hurston seems like he was a real person. And then he says that Neil, he says, Well, the reason I was fooled like I understand this now because, you know, he's slow. He's, he's on the spectrum. He's autistic. And and he's been he's been manipulated by some some some very bad people. And he's really slow but his wife is not she sharp and and these bad people are manipulating him to say these things because this point Scarlett hadn't testified right. It's manipulating say all these things and all this so So essentially, what the message here is, is that is that Neil's dumb guy has some sort of intellectual disability and that is evil ex wife Scarlett has gotten with these evil plaintiffs attorneys and some I don't know like some some people from Mike Bloomberg office or done some like, like crystal hypnosis on Neil or like, whatever like manipulated him in some way.

And for Neil was upsetting because like, I don't know noon Scarlett, they have a great relationship on some level, but like, oh, people who are not married, right? It feels like the idea of Scarlett is gonna manipulate me like ridiculous, absolutely stupid, stupidest thing I've ever heard. Like, I'll let that woman manipulate me I manipulate her like no, that's that's the end Scarlett was like really unlike Mark I feel like what like even now even now when he's supposedly saying it's real Neil was real he can't help himself but say that I'm deep state. Now that I that I'm that that's what I am is like, maybe that I'm like, she was like maybe like that even that I'm a real bomb or whatever. But like that I'm part of a deep state thing that's manipulating Neo or something. And she was just so in on it. And she was like, Look, Mark, when can I talk about it on the stand? And I said, Look, talk to Wes. He's in charge of your I'm not you. That's you doing the opposite. So you're in Westwood and had a conversation about it. Should we play this clip? And then they decided, yeah, like we needed to play this because she wants to talk about how she felt about what was said about Neil, and how that related to her. And so it was, it was a good little moment. Well, Jones takes this. And he, he's in his mind. He's like, Well, look, I said, Neil was Rios that it really happened. So like the lawyers lined or like I said, it happened to see that has to be right. So there was a point in the trial, of course, we're Scarlet went up and handed him a bottle of water after he was coughing to the whole testimony.

Like, it's not, it's not that long of a segment, really. And so he was trying to put in so what Alex now says, After the trial, is that when Scarlett came up to hand him a bottle of water that Alex said, you know, you know, basically like, I hope you watch my video or whatever. And Scarlett was like, Yes, I went and saw what you said, and my lawyers lied to me. And you were right. And you were right all along. And like, I'm crying because he was crying, and was crying about this. Yeah. And it's. So Scarlet, obviously is like, No, this is not okay, this is this is this sort of like post verdict stuff to try to, like, have this view that he's reconciling himself with the parents against the evil lawyers who manipulated them. Like that's what this whole thing is. She didn't want to let that stand. She was like, Mark, can we sue him? And I'm like, Well, hold on a second, because he's in bankruptcy right now. So just like pump your brakes for just a second. Because what we first have to do under the law is we have to demand a retraction from the guy. And that would give us the ability to see like, you can't, it doesn't matter whether he retracts it, but you can't sue him before you demand the retraction. Okay. And the effect of a successful or sufficient retraction and correction is that that plaintiff can't get punitive damages in the suit. Right but they can still sue even if you do the retraction. So we write him a pretty lengthy letter because as I remember Yeah, no this is because he appeared on Piers Morgan to say all this

But you need she never went up to you and said any of these things you say she said she never did any any of that.

When all this was happening, didn't care about New York strong at all, didn't care what they think don't care. The only thing helpings cares about is whether he can use them as props to sign to try to look better and that they like or when he doesn't actually care what they think or what they think of the apology. The part of the apology that is lawyers didn't write where he was talking. That was addressed to me that was telling him x&y was true, and I've got a suit against you. And that was him telling me no Bankston, you're wrong. Look at these videos, I'm gonna prove you wrong backs and right.

I think almost anybody would recognize that saying that scarlet came up and was crying and all this in the middle of the trial. And after the trial, you know, continuing on making a prop of this person who you have, you know, more or less terrorized for many years. Yeah. You know, like, that is a behavior that I think anybody would look at and be like, there's no reason to do that. That is monstrous shit. And the videos, you know, there is the angle of it. That is like, maybe I'm right, or whatever, right, there's that. But then if you take a step back and read it in the most generous light, I think you could just see it as him being like, there's reason for me to have maybe misheard something.

Yeah, totally. Cuz I don't. I don't I don't anymore. I believe I can, I can actually see that on some level of this idea that some of the things that Jones, I thought that he did, he had, he had round himself up in a way to make this roundabout circular bullshit log to convince himself that he was a good person. And I no longer believe that. And part of that is, look, I've read so much of his personal communications. I think Joe's knows exactly what a vile person he is. I think there's a lot of self loathing there about it. I think that's true of a lot of people who do some bad stuff and people. I don't necessarily think people are good or bad like that. I believe that like, their social patterns, and the determinism of their social media leads them into these horrible patterns of behavior that they can't escape from anymore.

Like nobody's nobody has had the amount of time where he has to answer in the ways that he's had to answer than he's had with me. And here, the three of us are sitting around, trying to deduce what's going on with this guy. And we still don't get it. Like it's still more to figure out there is still more to analyze.

Like I got so wrapped into this what's going on with this guy that I briefly during the suit convinced myself that he was like maniacally smart. Like he's really, really label test cated that he's initially letting on and that there's this weird thought process. No. And then I realized this just one of the most complicated dumb men ever do exist. Yeah. And you're right, that is so unique that when when this I don't think people who didn't live it really like who were seeing it, really understand the vibe of Alex Jones 2016 to 2018. And what he was in this country, and then the effect that he plays, because whatever you might want to say for what for his audiences right now, it is not that and what he does, he does not have that cultural influence, footprint, any of those things he does not. He is not. He's there's something like, again, I hate to use those, like the word like this, but he's like Zeitgeist II for 2016 2018. And he was at the height of his powers. And so like I there was there could have been a lot of things I could have taken on at that point in my career, but seen that opportunity. I was like, This guy's unique. And if you do damage to him, you you actually do something. You change trajectories and stuff. And maybe we did. I don't know. I know. He's not at the height of his powers. And I know we defend him.
