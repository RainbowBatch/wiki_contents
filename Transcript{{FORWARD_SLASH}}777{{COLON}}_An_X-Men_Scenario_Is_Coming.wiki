No. Metal comes from the Greek word matalon, which is a word that has connotations with like things that are mined. Conversely, meta is a prefix and preposition. It comes from the Greek preposition word meta, which had a number of different contexts depending on the word and sentence where it was used. It's most commonly understood to mean like after or change, for instance, metamorphosis is the combination of the noun morph with which means shape and meta meaning change unless you have a change in shape or form. That is metamorphosis, right? There are a ton of meanings for meta in the depths of Greek grammar, but is not the time to get into it. But suffice it to say meta and meta metal are not related. No. Also in the Hebrew, l doesn't refer to a specific god. It's the generic phrasing. Also, it's not the letter L.
