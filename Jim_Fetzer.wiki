Jim Fetzer is a retired American philosophy professor and conspiracy theorist who has been involved in promoting false and harmful conspiracy theories related to major events in American history, most notably denying [[The Sandy Hook Elementary Massacre]]. His promotion of these claims has led to real harm, particularly for the families of the victims who have been harassed and threatened people influenced by Fetzer.

Fetzer has been involved in promoting false conspiracy theories related to the 9/11 attacks, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. He has claimed that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job, that Kennedy's assassination was carried out by multiple shooters, and that the Sandy Hook shooting was a staged event.

In 2019, a Wisconsin jury awarded a settlement of $450,000 to the father of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, after Fetzer was found to have defamed him and caused him emotional distress by promoting the false conspiracy theory that the shooting was a hoax<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/sandy-hook-shooting-leonard-pozner-lawsuit-james-fetzer-900334/</ref>.
