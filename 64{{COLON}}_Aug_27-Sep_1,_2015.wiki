Today, Dan tells Jordan about the breakthrough 9th installment into what happened in 2015 to convince Alex Jones to join up with the Trump campaign. Dan is pretty sure he's make a massive break in the case, but you can decide that for yourself. Topics covered include:

*Where did Alex's chimera narrative come from?
*Did Alex steal "Hillary For Prison" from a bumper sticker he saw?
*Does Alex Jones have a conceal-carry permit?
*What race of women is Alex most attracted to?

==Tidbits==

*Trump likes guns, chimeras, aliens are fallen angels. Guatemalans fishing at the green belt. Alex likes Gaddafi. Hillary for Prison IP. Alex likes Dave Clark. Alex thinks sci-fi is reality. Alex brags about his audience, incites violence, and supports a racist caller. Moneybomb/tax problems. Dan loves Fast & Furious movies. Larry Nichols is still crazy, guns will be grabbed. 2015 investigation theories getting close to a conclusion.
