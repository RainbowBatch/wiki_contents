I did not research as in depth as I probably should have on this topic. I googled Bastrop monkey tests are monkey trials and that sort of thing with monkey in the title. And everything that came up was nothing, or this bar listener pointed out that there is animal testing that has gone on in Bastrop through the University of Texas, and I've looked into it a bit and it is it is a real thing. There were chimpanzees and other monkeys that they had testing. Right. But still, they still were slightly wrong. But I looked into it, I can see no evidence of the sort of shape he's talking about. Okay, but we were wrong to clown on it. Like we did, because there was actual animal testing.

    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 03:55
    | text      = The reality too, though, is that our country has a really bad track record with animal testing. And so the idea that something fucked up was going on there isn't unbelievable. But what Alex is describing is yes. So it's like, hey, we were wrong. We shouldn't have clowned, maybe we should have claimed it was fun to clown at least a little bit. Yeah. But at the end of the day, you know, there's a little bit of truth underneath his lies. And we can all agree that based on the fact that there was monkey research being done there, the name of that Tiki Bar is really shitty. So we hypothesized that it was here it we hypothesized that it was an area 51 possible right thing with a joke bar name. It turns out that is the case anyway. Sorry. We didn't dig deeper. Who cares?

So I want to get to today are episode that we're going to be talking about is something that happened on the Wednesday show, which is May 17. There was a continuation of the rest of the week, which up till that point had been mostly bro downtime between Roger Stone and Alex Jones. And then once Roger Stone left, Mike Cernovich, sort of filled in over Skype a bunch, and they just sort of like we're awesome. Okay,

    | text      = I described that on the last show. You know how that was sort of the theme of the week. Right? And that continued into Wednesday. But then, in the, towards the third hour of the show, something really, really fucked up happened. That will be what we talk about for this episode. Okay, but because you asked me before the show, and I did tweet out about this a bit. I want to cover what he was doing on Thursday. Today, as we record this on Thursday, Alex Jones spent the entire show all pretty much the entire show. Just talking about how Comey is busted. Jim Comey Dead to Rights busted for what? So as he would say, as Alex would tell it, Comey wrote this memo that has been leaked where people have discussed this memo, or that President Trump will. But it's hard to get those words out. Yeah,

    | text      = had asked him or suggested that he should move on from the Flynn investigation. Yes. And Comey action of justice Comey wrote a memo about that. And then later, he was in front of the Senate, and he was being questioned. And they asked him a question. And in his answer, he said that no, people had not asked him to stop his investigation. He hadn't been pressured right. Now, here's the important thing. If that was all the information, Alex would have an interesting thing to go on here.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 07:04
    | text      = Yeah, I would it would be it would be kind of misleading for him to say I wasn't pressured, which well, then now talk about that memo. So that kind of invalidates the memos, negative connotations,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 07:18
    | text      = or its authenticity, there's a lot of things right, get called into question, right? Or did he perjure himself when he was being invested? Because if the most rational explanation, if the reality isn't what I'm about to explain to you, if Alex's narrative is true, the most rational explanation would be like when he's in front of the Senate, he is in the middle of a obstruction of justice case that he's building. Right. And so he can't comment on it. So he would say he would have to answer with I can't comment on that, blah, blah, blah. But since he says no one has tried to stop the investigation, right? It's like, oh, that's an indication that no one has Yeah. Now unfortunately, Alex is using this clip that I'm about to play as his evidence that Comey is busted. All right. And I'd like to remind everyone he played this probably 15 to 20 times on the show on Thursday and screamed, you're dead. Comey. We got you. We got you.

And so you ought to stop investing resources in it. But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal.

I'm sure we've never demolished a government and caused another civil war that's been raging on for, what, 20 years now, forever. Now, I'm sure we've never created terrorists, fucking groups that are causing all kinds of shit around the world.

And then it became popular for women to have really short hair. So his example was, does it make a difference? If I influenced her to do that? Or if she did it on her own?

It kind of gets to a point where we talk a lot about Trump. And we talk a lot about Paul Ryan being an asshole. And we could talk about Chafetz. Resigning today, yeah, all this shit, we could and we should, in some fashion or another. But at the end of the day, this podcast is about Infowars and Alex Jones, right. And they're not really Republicans. They hate Paul Ryan, because he takes money from George Soros. And they think he's a globalist Alex Jones, to his credit, hated George Bush too. So like, he has a not consistent, but at least he has a philosophy where he's not strictly a Republican, he is the other. And that's the problem that I want to address more, I need this podcast to be about. Look, if Trump gets fucking impeached, we still have the problem on our hands that we have right now. And that is that Alex Jones. And Infowars is a media arm of a really dangerous movement. Now they can call it patriots. They can call it we just want to bring back our country, right? Or whatever, bad boys. Sure. That's not what they're doing. That's code. There is really dangerous, bigoted nationalism. That's going all over the world. It's all over the place. Yeah. And we can see it, we can see it through the forages of the world. We can see it through LePen and see it and Putin. We can see it in Trump and what his his weird tendrils here, the rebel media, the Info Wars, and that's who we're against. We're not against the Republicans, even though we actually are also we are also against the Republic. But this podcast is about that movement. Yes. That's really what we're worried about. Trump gets impeached. Great. Our problem isn't over, we're not done.

Yeah, rather than accepting the truth and expanding They instead double down on the bullshit that they believe. Yeah, but they're there. That can't be everybody. There is a percentage of people who will accept that truth. And that's what I think we are going for here. Just like just like with Trump voters, right? 38% of the polls will always be for Trump. You're not going to get that. Yeah. But that used to be 45%. It used to be higher than that. So the idea that people are unable to learn from something that contradicts their core belief, I can't believe is a is universal. So I think the and the difference in in percentage wise, can overthrow elections. Like imagine we really get just 5% of people who voted for Trump to get out and vote for somebody else. That is the presidential election overthrown. That's how many Republican governorships how many Republican Congressmen, how many of all of these people go away, because the margins are oftentimes razor thin, crazy slim. And now they are going to be even more so to the point where if you if we had a competent, committed Democratic Party, that actually was a progressive, a progressive organization, I think there's a good chance that in 2018, they would overwhelmingly use that same populist message but in a positive way, and wind up getting over two thirds of the Congress.

So what happened was, in 2011, Podesta joined the board of joule Unlimited, a solar based alternative fuel company headquartered in Massachusetts, with operations in New Mexico and the Netherlands. A few months after Podesta took on this role, and a totally true bias chairman and CEO of Russia backed investment fund Rusnano also joined jewels board, there doesn't appear to be anything untoward or illegal about the fact that Podesta sat on a corporate board with a Russian banker. Nevertheless, some of his and Clinton's critics have played it up conservative website, The Daily Caller has alleged that Podesta didn't properly disclose his shares and Jewel when he joined the Obama administration in 2014. In any case, the company is American, not Russian. That is courtesy of PolitiFact that has some good resources, you can check out citations. It's absolute nonsense.

These claims were repudiated by other veterans who served with carry and often were disproven by outside sources, including the Navy's official records. Oh, boy.

I was keeping track of conservative not conservative necessarily, but like conspiracy message boards and stuff. And a lot of people were using the murderer as sort of a left wing conspiracy theory. They were saying that he was killed because he had stumbled into evidence that the Russians were hacking in Russia. It was liberal conspiracies going around about his murder. Then it got repurposed as he was the one who was leaking emails to WikiLeaks. He had stolen the Podesta emails and what have you. And even Julian Assange has hinted that he is the source, but he has never said that he is because he wasn't. But Julian Assange is committing acts of propaganda by going out and saying, We never divulge our sources, right, because sometimes they get murdered on the streets, right, those sort of like little, little kernels. So now recently, a couple days back, Fox News got into the game and took that conspiracy theory that had already existed in the nether regions of the internet and made it mainstream. They started pushing it really hard. When they had a guy named rod Wheeler be on Fox News. He was on a he was on then he was a private investigator. That's how they built him.

We're a family who's committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding sets murders. Now, Dustin stern back, the chief spokesman for the DC police force said this quote, There is nothing that we can find that any of this is accurate, said Dustin sternbach, the chief spokesman for the DC police, which is leading the investigation into Rich's death. He refused to be more specific. FBI spokesman declined to comment saying the agency is not involved in the case and referred questions DC police. Law enforcement officials have said that sets Seth Rich's computer and email activity have been examined, and nothing suggests that would connect them to WikiLeaks, which 12 days after Rich's death, published 20,000 emails that embarrassed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the DNC and forced the ouster of its Chairwoman.

Because about a week and a half ago, Alex had as his guest, this weirdo from New Orleans, who rides around on a bike with a TV behind him and plays Infowars. Okay, and this lady came up to him, and he took video of it. And it was this lady who was like, I want Alex Jones taken out. And she was like, my son was brainwashed by him that you don't understand this. Yeah, terrible. Yeah. And so he this guy in New Orleans, just start screaming at her about like, you want him taken out because of his free speech. So he puts out this video, right Alec sees it. He invites him on as a guest on the show, of course, and they talk about how free speech is dying. And all this stuff not at all engaging with the idea that her son was brainwashed by him, essentially. Don't talk about it. Yeah, it doesn't matter. So this guy is an asshole first real proud. Boys.
