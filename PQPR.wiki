PQPR is a Nevada LLC owned and controlled by Alex through a confusing and byzantine web of shell companies and trusts.

It was formed in 2013<ref>https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tx/0801863807</ref> (probably as part of Alex's divorce from [[Kelly Jones]]). From 2013 until 2018, PQPR appears to have been completely inactive, existing on paper only. In 2018, shortly after an appellate court allowed the Texas Sandy Hook case and Texas Parkland case to proceed, PQPR began to claim that [[Free Speech Systems LLC]] (FSS) owed it more than $50M dollars<ref name=":0">https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/alex-jones-tufta.pdf</ref>. FSS subsequently began paying large sums of money, including 60-80% of ongoing revenue<ref name=":0" />. If you follow where the money, it ends up in a trust where Alex Jones is the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/remainderma remainderman], meaning that he could collect these profits<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIczy1avGDs&t=15003s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIczy1avGDs]</ref>.

Because these transfers appear to be a transparent attempt to move money out of reach of FSS creditors' reach, [[Texas TUFTA Case|a lawsuit was filed under TUFTA]] to reverse these transfers.
