'''Lee Stranahan''' is a journalist who is being sued along with Alex Jones. Lee Stranahan used to write for Brietbart, but quit in protest, and began working for Sputnik, which is a state-owned Russian media outlet. [http://thehill.com/homenews/media/327559-former-breitbart-reporter-joins-russian-propaganda-network-im-on-the-russian When asked about the situation], he said: "I'm on the Russian payroll now. When you work at Sputnik you're being paid by the Russians."

After the Nazi rally in Charlottesville, VA, Lee Stranahan went on InfoWars and other outlets to claim a connection between the rally and [[George Soros]], arguing that this was a repeat of what "the Globalists" did in Ukraine (mirroring the Russian government's position that they were the "good guys" in Ukraine).
