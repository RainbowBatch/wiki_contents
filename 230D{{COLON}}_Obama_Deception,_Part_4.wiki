Today, Dan and Jordan enter the home stretch, episode 4 of their coverage of Alex Jones' 2009 "documentary" The Obama Deception. In this installment, we pick up on a cliff-hanger and learn about how insane Ron Paul's brother is, then learn a little bit about Ron's career in the House of Representatives. It's not all Paul family stuff this episode though, there's also some historical revisionism and more made-up quotes.
