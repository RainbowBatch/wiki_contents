That's what I've heard, but how long did it take him to go from? I love Rand Paul, but I liked the things that Trump is saying. All right, we got a sport Trump to being I will die for Trump, right? How long does that transformation take? And I suggest it's not going to take long. This investigation is going to be a very short event. It might be two episodes. All right. I think it happens in January of 2016. I think he becomes like a fully dedicated propaganda outlet for Trump fucking quick. But today we're going to be going over January 6 and seventh because in the new year he has David Knight host a bid to nurse that hangover though that that New Year's hangover and so we jump in on January 6
