Today, Dan tells Jordan about something that he kind of got wrong on the last episode regarding campaign donors in the 2016 election. It wasn't incorrect information, as much as it was a situation where the way things were presented wasn't entirely fair, and Dan felt it was necessary to provide this clarification.
