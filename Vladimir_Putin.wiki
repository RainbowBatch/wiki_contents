Earlier in [[Alex Jones|Alex]]'s career, Putin was a huge villain, but as the American far right has embraced pro-Russian narratives (primarily due to Russia's embrace of white supremacist talking points), Alex has warmed on Putin to the point where, in Alex's telling, Putin is one of the few major points of opposition to the [[Globalists]].
