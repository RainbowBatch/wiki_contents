'''Joe Rogan''' is a comedian, actor and MMA enthusiast who hosts one of the biggest podcasts in the world. While his show originally was an entertaining blend of testosterone, conspiracy dabbling, and pseudo-spirituality, it has shifted over the years to becoming a platform for malicious entities to soft-peddle awful rhetoric, more or less unquestioned.

When [[Alex Jones]] was on his show, [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-joe-rogan-appearance Rogan allowed Alex to lie to his audience repeatedly] about very serious topics. When Rogan had Alex's economist friend [[Peter Schiff]] on, Rogan allowed Schiff to spread narratives about how everyone needs to buy gold because the dollar is going to collapse, only to reveal at the end of the show that he himself sells gold. This isn't even taking into account all of the horribly inaccurate and irresponsible shit he's allowed people like [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], [[Ben Shapiro]], [[Sam Harris]], and many others to disseminate to his audience, seemingly lacking the ability or interest in debating their rhetoric.
