One of them is that he does not speak in any specifics about his information that he has. He just like just proclaims that he's always right. When if you really look into it, he's wrong about almost everything. Yeah, he's absolutely just is facts are shoddy. He just has assertions that he never backs up ever, just so much documentation of shit he's predicted that he's wrong about but the other thing is this idea that he comes to at the end or is like, everyone's dumb, and you can't even communicate with them. And there's two there's two things I want to speculate about there. One is that because he has a very specific mental illness, he can't talk to other people. He seems crazy. Whenever anyone else is talking to him, he can't communicate because he just starts rambling about globalists and rational forces and vague references to documents right and scientists you may or may not have talked to and everyone may or may not be read and then words like I can't follow You even the most generous of interviewer, he's gonna yell at them, it's impossible for him to interact with anybody on a human level. Right? I've seen him with his co hosts and stuff. It's even mildly abusive. So I think there's some of that he's projecting shit a little bit. And then beyond that, that is also a mentality that is espoused in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. This idea that most of the masses are dumb, and the globalists are trying to make them dumb in order to make them malleable.

They didn't overthrow Ukraine. They started George Soros, the same group of bankers. They're now having their assets all over the world seized, their company shut down that Americans and Brits and Germans and other people work in. Number WikiLeaks. Assange trying to find a job in other countries. Here we go. And NATO would force Russian aircraft down to search him. That's the New World Order, folks. So there's nowhere to run.
