No one wanted to have their deposition placed on video online to the ridicule while the Alex haters knowledge fight. There are people there's a there's a whole knowledge fight.com or something called Knowledge first or knowledge fight. These people will apparently live by loving date Alex Jones, and they pounced on every piece of video they can find. Knowledge find much fight.

Yeah, and in case, you know, you could hear the intro and feel like things are maybe taken a little bit out of context. Yeah, here is the clip of norm talking about us on his podcast.

And so the haters would we had a field day with the corporate reps and the corporate reps. There's not there's no there there, there is no real organization. So they testified about what they knew. And their answer to most things is, I don't know, good question, really. And he that young man was able to persuade a trial judge in Texas that this was willful failure, that the corporation had an obligation to produce a representative that could answer his questions because there had to be answers. And so there was a nother deadline in Texas to produce a corporate rep. We selected I selected a person from Connecticut because no one else it Infowars was willing to do it again. No one wanted to have their deposition placed on video online to the root of the Alex haters, because you know what, there are people there's a, there's a website I've heard about called Knowledge fight. You know, these are a couple bottom feeders there are make their chops eating out. And so they have episodes almost daily, and they you know, they'll call me out they'll call this one. I mean, I don't know if Alex is going to get a percentage of the royalties for the space. Oh, good luck. And so the Alex haters didn't you know, the corporate reps didn't want to be exposed to that again. So the Connecticut representative testified she didn't satisfy the fireplug or the Texas judge. She testified in Connecticut three and a half days. I call that the Gilligan's Island direct the guy Heteroptera the lawyer for the plaintiffs.

What is important is that there is a recognition here of behavioral change that was made at Infowars, which is prior to this Rob do was totally fine. Going in a being a candle wearing doofus sitting in there being on I don't know, how many did he do? A couple eggs? Yeah, exactly. And then, you know, Daria was totally fine. These depositions, I don't actually think she's afraid of me at all, or anything. But these people were not willing to do this and face the kind of scrutiny in the public eye that our podcast brings. Literally airwaves, only our podcast brings, right. And the other thing that it reveals do is that there are discussions. They know us being a motivating factor in them not wanting so to be the corporate rep, which is fucking hilarious.

There are basic elements of his timeline and surrounding context of his writing that Maddie can demonstrate which Adan seems to think are like undiscoverable secrets. Also, I find it very strange. angen probably difficult to believe that Adan didn't talk to Alex or rob do about being deposed. They work together. This is in relation to a suit against Alex and the company. And as Don says he was supposed to be at work that day. It seems like he would have to come up with a reason he couldn't make it to work. So I guess he must just lied to his employer right off the bat that doesn't inspire confidence in him as a credible witness highlighting his willingness to deceive.

Yeah, I could possibly see a scenario where a Don was afraid to tell Alex that he was actually going to show up and talk to the lawyers, but outside or something like that.

The first is really transparent, which is how a conspiracy theorist answers a question. A Don has asked why he was suspicious about 911 But it's a conspiracy he hasn't focused on in a while, so a lot of the talking points are a bit foggy in his memory. So he tries to give a vague non answer, then Maddie asks for something more specific and Adan base Because this guy like it doesn't seem right and building seven as his response, which is pretty soft. Yeah. The second thing is something that will become important later is some of Maddies questions develop. This is something that Adan is suspicious about. He has some inconclusive things to point to that he can use to justify these suspicions. And based on having those suspicions he just testified to Matty that led him to suspect the US government was involved. This provides a clear example of a Don's thought process where he's willing to take things that look weird and make him suspicious and use them to build a baseless explanatory narratives. Hold on to this for later because it will become clear how relevant this is to the matter at hand. And how much of a mistake this was on a Don's part in reflection, yeah, maybe it doesn't, you know, lead to any direct consequences. But if you're analyzing this and looking at the way he describes his process and how he interacts with information, it's very damning. And it will that'll become clear later. Yeah.

That was an article Rappaport wrote on December 18, but the one from the 16th, which has been discussed here since it was forwarded to a dawn is actually about something else. The Batman part of this has to do with the Aurora shooting happening at a screening of Batman and the theories about James Holmes thinking he was the Joker. And this article Sandy Hook relates to the Hunger Games. I'm just going to read you here. Some of John Rapoport brilliant work. Oh please. quote, we now have the boggling connection to the Hunger Games, and that sci fi novel and film 24 Children are picked to take part in a competitive national blood sacrifice killing ritual. One child survives at the end and 23 Die 20 died in Newtown and the author of The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins lives in Sandy Hook Next, a new town. And this means this is just the kind of bizarre and insane ops secret societies are reputed to enjoy. Ordinarily, I would ignore this sort of thing and just call it a coincidence, but it's too improbable. I can't prove the killings in New Town were part of a kind of up, but I can't disregard it either. The quote coincidence is just too stunning. And if the Hunger Games connection is real here, then all bets are off. The coincidence that Rappaport finds too stunning is that Suzanne Collins lives nearby and the number of children who are killed in The Hunger Games that doesn't match the number of dead at Sandy Hook, but it's kind of close plus

Because where there's smoke, there's usually fire. Oh my god, what we found is interesting to say the least. It seems like this isn't quite how he's describing his writing in this deposition is Christ from the article. It sounds like they were studying these maps searching for clues to prove that there was foreign knowledge and that they found interesting stuff and where there's smoke, there's usually fire seems pretty overt and it's point I would say, yeah, and Adan doesn't point out that the prop master was from Sandy Hook, he does bring up that there's a sandy hook in New Jersey, but it's kind of a non sequitur between heavy insinuation of a conspiracy and then this quote for those who are left asking why would someone do this? Okay, Alfred Pennyworth. Bruce Wayne Oh says have an evil force and the Dark Knight movie some men aren't looking for anything logical like money they can't be bought, bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn. The article ends with this quote, if you're enjoying spotting these bizarre coincidences and traveling down the road of curiosity with us, stay tuned for tomorrow's scintillating revelation.

The video is a tell all leave no stone unturned work that coalesces hundreds of data points, which researchers laborious Lee spent countless hours compiling. That certainly sounds like what you might write if the video was too long, you couldn't even make it through the whole thing and you can't even really nail down what the point of it was. Also, the article includes this update, quote, a previous version of this video was removed from YouTube due to a copyright claim by Lenny Posner.

It would just be a reaction, you'd start asking yourself things like how is this possible? Is there information I'm missing? What's the context here? Is it possible for both this table to be accurate and the shooting happened as was reported, the not questioning is actually a choice a Don is making and he does that because if he scratched even an inch below the surface, he couldn't make the insane claims that he does make for a living. He is woefully unqualified and doesn't have the tools to be in the role he pretends to be in, which is that of a writer and reporter Yeah, that ability to turn off the instinct to question things when something conforms to your narrative while simultaneously yelling at your audience about how you're the people who question things.
