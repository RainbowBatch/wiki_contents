A lawsuit by parents and family members of the victims of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting]. It alleges that false statements Jones made claiming that the shooting was fake or staged were defamatory towards the victims and their family members. This lawsuit also names [[Genesis Communications Network]] (GCN) as a defendant. There is [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|a similar case, filed by a separate group of family members, in Texas]].

The lawsuit was originally filed in 2018.

In November of 2021, and after years of sanctionable conduct by the Jones Defendants, [[Judge Barbara Bellis]] issued a default judgement, meaning that Jones and his companies are presumed to have committed the alleged conduct and will have to pay damages<ref>https://eu.statesman.com/story/news/2021/11/15/alex-jones-ruling-liable-bydefault-sandy-hook-lawsuits-connecticut/8627894002/</ref>.

In April of 2022, the Jones defendants were briefly able to pause the case when [[InfoW et. al. Bankruptcy Case|three of the shell-company defendants filed for bankruptcy]]. This did not ultimately affect the trial schedule. Similarly, the proceeding was briefly paused when [[Free Speech Systems Bankruptcy Case|Free Speech Systems declared bankruptcy]].

After months of bad faith tactics from InfoWars, and other delays, the trial to determine the amount of damages began on September 13th, 2022. Jury selection happened in the weeks prior.
