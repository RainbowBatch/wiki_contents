Today, Dan and Jordan check back in on how Alex Jones is doing these days. In this installment, Alex is on an emotional rollercoaster that finds him yelling about the devil, targeting another high school student, and being fairly ambivalent about whether or not his listeners should kill their family members who aren't against vaccines.
