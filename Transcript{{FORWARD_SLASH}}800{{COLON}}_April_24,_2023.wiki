And so that's really some of the good news because we can get Alex's take on it. And the show will be covering the the events, and we'll get down to business on that. And something that should be disqualifying on his part. Here we go. And we'll get to that too. But before we do, let's say hello to some new ones. Oh, that's a great idea.

So Tucker, going off the air is a big deal, because it will have ripple effects for all the Patriots and what have you. And it's important to recognize that Alex's show is right on that knife's edge to it could go away at any time. And he got to keep them in the game. And the reason you got to keep them in the game, is because there's very serious things going on. Okay. Now, this next clip is disgusting. It involves Alex talking about crimes against children and sucks. But I do I am going to play this for a reason. And it may become clearer towards the end of this episode. Why? Okay, so here's one of the big headlines Alex as for the day.

Because the globalists are systematically cutting off the power getting rid of the borders. I just had a lengthy 45 minute discussion this morning. With senior people in the federal government, I'll leave it at that I mean, extremely senior. And they have been trying to get the story out obviously on Fox. And they have the documents of Biden releasing over 20,000 known pedophiles, I mean hardcore child rapist. I mean people that have been convicted of being school bus drivers and for disabled children and raping eight of them's nine of them. And I'm just sitting there for 45 minutes that I had to go in this meeting. Hearing all this the documents and I'm sitting there talking to beds from different agencies,

That's not how it works came out then it got swept on the rug, Mavericks games. A whole bunch of kids got kidnapped, but those it just disappeared. And that they find him in Oklahoma City being gang raped in a hotel room. And that's the ones they found this is all going on at scales just completely off the charts.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 00:14:35.000
    | text      = So that's all awful. Yeah. I don't know what Alex's definition of like senior people in the federal government is. But I don't think that we have the same sense of what that is. Yeah, I would agree. This entire story that Alex is telling is a load of shit and it really makes a mockery of pretending to care about crimes against children. There's a reality of that problem. And that's something that's discussed by serious adults who care about addressing the issue. What Alex is doing is exploiting the intense feelings that people have around child abuse and using that to power his own conspiracy bullshit. Consider this. In that clip. The problem isn't really that children are being abused. Now, the abuse of children is a prop that's meant to give power to the larger problem, which is Biden, who's supposedly releasing all of these hard, hardened Sex Criminals.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:15:29.000
    | text      = he's not really cared about the end result problem as much as he is. He's using that. So there is an actual single case that came out that Alex is talking about where a 15 year old girl was lured away from a Dallas Dallas Mavericks game on April 8 2022. And found to being trafficked at a hotel in Oklahoma City. 10 days later, it's an unthinkable horror that girl went through and the people responsible have been arrested and hopefully see the full extent of the laws punishments. Alex is taking her actual experience and exploiting it by generalizing it into a narrative that's happening on this giant scale at Mavericks games. And, you know, he's, he's ballooning it out from a single example, which is what he does, that's really inappropriate, and it illustrates pretty clearly his disrespect for the victims in crimes like this. Trafficking is real, but Alex's approach to this does nothing to solve the problem. It's only designed to blame his chosen target for the existence of the problem and to direct the audience's negative emotions on to that chosen target. The fentanyl thing is something that's popped up on social media memes over the past year or so in different forms. But there's no evidence that that's happening. In September of last year, there was a viral post about claims that people were handing out roses laced with fentanyl to try to incapacitate people to be trafficked chair experts who have weighed on all this if said that this method of incapacitating someone would be very impractical. The difference in dose between knocking your target out and killing them would be very small. So you would probably end up killing a bunch of people accidentally before you got the got it right.

There's also the issue of two lawsuits against Tucker that have been filed by his former senior booking producer Abby Grossberg, Grossberg accused Tucker show and Fox of sexism and workplace harassment. Tucker, Senior Executive Producer Justin Wells is also a named defendant in that suit, and he was also fired by Fox along with Tucker Yeah, I get the sense that this will be a story that will come out to more, you know, we'll get to the clearer picture on this in the future. But as far as I can tell that this is a business decision by Fox to protect themselves from further harm, much like when they fired Bill O'Reilly consequences for shitty actions. Yeah. And the same can be said for James O'Keefe. He's been pulling his bullshit pretending to be journalism for like a decade now. And no one cares so long. Most people just ignore his dumb publicity stunts, and he's essentially a political non variable. However, the Project Veritas board didn't appreciate that he was spending ridiculous amounts of money on personal stuff like quote, $14,000 on a charter flight to meet someone to fix his boat under the guise of meeting with a donor, or how he spent quote, more than $150,000 on private cars in an 18 month span. They directly called it misappropriation of their finances, and a lot of his stunts have the potential to leave Veritas open to legal exposure, as it did in 2022. And the organization was successfully sued for $120,000 for violating wiretapping laws in one of their sting. Exactly. James O'Keefe is a piece of shit and his actions are a liability for the organization that he founded now that it's grown into something that involves more than publicity stunts to feed his ego, and he got bit by his own snake. It's what happens.

And like Kota cleanses, totally, totally, no one's trying to ruin his life. He's just facing the piling up of consequences for shady actions he's made, and he can't bear the prospect of admitting that. So it has to be someone else's fault, has to be the result of a giant global conspiracy out to get him and people like him who have the same beliefs. Yep, maybe this would be a good time for him to sit back and consider how the people he claims have the same political beliefs as him seem to all be people who are operating their businesses in Super scammy ways that are often illegal. Maybe he doesn't actually have a political community as much as he has a collection of con men who are invested in protecting each other scams, because they're somewhat interdependent. Yeah, yeah, that sounds right. Yeah. AOC didn't say the conservatives should not be allowed on TV. She said that, quote, we have real issues with what's permissible on air. And we saw that with January 6, and we saw that in the lead up to January 6, and how we navigate questions, not just freedom of speech, but also accountability for incitement of violence. That's the role we have to explore through law as well. She went on to say, quote, I believe that when it comes to broadcast television, like Fox News, these are subject to federal law and regulation in terms of what's allowed on air and what isn't. And when you look at what Tucker Carlson and some of these other folks on Fox do, it's very, very clearly incitement of violence very clearly. And that's the line that I think we have to be willing to contend with. This was reported on right wing media as AOC saying that they needed to make new laws and regulation to not let Tucker do the shady does, but that's not accurate. She was just saying those regulations already exist, and we just need to acknowledge reality for what it is and take this shit seriously, which of course would be a threat to rest of that right.

So is Alex gonna feel the need to connect that to his larger conspiracy narrative that he's constructing? Probably not because it's inconvenient, and it's too hard to make that fit and make sense. That's just a random thing that happened, but Don lemons termination, that's related. For what it's worth, there's been speculation that lemons termination has to do with some sexist comments and behavior, including recently saying on air that Nikki Haley was, quote, not in her prime. Variety covered what appears to be a bit of a pattern behind the scenes and an article they published on April 5, which could go a long way toward explaining what feels kind of like an abrupt termination, but maybe isn't. Yeah, we just aren't privy to some of that information. Yeah,

Text messages were found in discovery that very clearly indicated that the people who are making fraudulent claims about Dominion knew that what they were reporting on was false when they reported it, which means that the case for actual malice would be very simple for dominion to make. Yeah, Fox hadn't lost the case at that point officially. But everyone including Fox knew that if it went to trial, they had no chance, which is why they settled. Alex had every opportunity to engage with discovery in his own case, and he chose not to because he also knew that he would lose if the case went to trial. He tried to lowball the Sandy Hook families with settlement offers which they declined, so he was not given the off ramp that Fox was able to take. Instead, he was forced to drag his heels and try every trick he could come up with to stall the proceedings and hope to force the families to settle they did not. And ultimately, Alex's shady behavior earned him a lot of fines in the form of sanctions. And ultimately, when other attempts to get him to participate failed, he was defaulted. He did it all to himself. He has no one else to blame. And interestingly, during the damages hearing, Alex went on air and made claims about the plaintiffs in the case, when the Texas case was ongoing. Alex talked quite a bit about Scarlet Lewis and Neil Heslin, which was really, really disrespectful. One of the claims he made about Miss Lewis was that she realized that Alex was actually right, and that her attorneys had lied to him, lied to her about him, which we can hear in this clip here.

So weird, have the truth keep changing. Yeah, there's a discrepancy here because Alex is just making the story up. One possible reason is because, you know, without some kind of face saving story like this, Alex seems like the piece of shit that he actually is, in the case of the trial, he traumatized these grieving parents and then continued to do so while the trial was happening, because it was profitable for him sincerely. Another possibility is that Alex really is just that delusional, like reality may not be a fixed construct for him. And events exist merely to satisfy story beats that he needs to exist to be there, so he can tell his heroic narrative. Yeah, I don't think that's the case. But it's a possibility. Hey, solipsism may be overwhelming to the point of God knows fine that if that were the case, he would not be as functionalism. Right. It seems impossible. Yeah, it would come out in many other ways. Yeah, whatever the case, after Alex was on piers, his show, Scarlet sent him a warning letter saying that he needed to retract and correct this clear lie about her. You may notice that this never happened on his show, and we haven't heard about it. And that's because it's buried in a video he put out on band dot video, and almost nobody has seen. But since I was curious, and because I'll take any excuse not to listen to Oh, and CO hosting, I decided now might be a good time for us to listen to that retraction video as a distraction. Oh, boy, I actually found this because I was going through I was trying like Alex made all these ridiculous claims about how many views his videos get. Yeah. And so I was going through trying to find the last time he had anything that was over a million views. And I don't think I could find anything on it. I got bored after a couple of months. The highest things he had were like the Yang interview, and the the Roseanne one but those were like 600 something 1700 1000 Wow. So like they weren't even crossing the million. The only things on Bandai video that get like over a million sometimes are Greg Reese's reports. Anyway, so I was I was scrolling through all of them. I was like, retraction. What is this? Yeah.

We were in trial in Austin, Texas on Miss Lewis claims of defamation she filed against me. during that trial, Miss Lewis and her ex husband approached me to talk, which we did, and after a brief conversation, we shook hands. Later, I appeared on piers Morgan's television show, talking about the trial and recounted the brief conversation I have with Miss Lewis. Recently, I received a letter from Mark Bankston, one of the lawyers from his Karla Lewis in the Texas Sandy Hook trial, in which Miss Lewis lawyer demanded from me a correction clarification or retraction of those few statements I had made in January of 2023, on the Piers Morgan show, about the courtroom conversation with Miss Lewis, and I'm happy to oblige.

I made certain comments about the tragic nature of the Sandy Hook shooting, where I confirm that Miss Lewis was real, and the shooting was real, and the death of her son was real. Miss Lewis, however, was incorrectly told that I had attacked her as an actor in my broadcast, and she so testified not having actually heard my honor statements from that morning's broadcast. I was called to testify immediately after Miss Lewis and I immediately corrected her misperception. Later that afternoon at a break, Miss Lewis and her ex husband walked over to me in the courtroom.

His primary operating principle is to use people like them as a means to an end, not an end in and of themselves. There was a video of him shaking their hands, so he knew he could make up a story about that interaction that would be believable enough to his audience based on the fact that the video exists. That's all he cared about. And if he never got a demand for a retraction that his lawyers insisted to take seriously, Alex would never have even considered how much his words could affect Ms. Lewis. They don't exist as actual people with actual feelings to Alex and less he needs to act like they do in order to avoid the consequences of his actions. The second major problem is that he seems to be trying to mount a defense for his claims rather than retract or clarify them. By playing a series of clips. Alex seems to be suggesting that maybe Scarlett is the one lying about their exchange, which really seems like the last thing you should be doing it a retraction.

And Louis, because he doesn't want his audience to have that context, in case they stumble onto this retraction video, he's trying to provide a retraction video that he thinks is just barely a retraction, just enough to make it work. While simultaneously it's supposed to serve it to reassure the audience that I have. Alex is actually right. Yep. Yeah. And if the conclusion is that Alex is right, and doesn't really need to have made a retraction, then the audience would reach the very obvious next conclusion, which is that Scarlett is lying about their exchange. Yep. I Alex's continuing terrorizing of these people is recapped recontextualized. For the audience as a continuing attack on Alex himself, because he's a malicious, abusive cult leader.

At trial, prosecutors claimed that this was the third time that Raider had been caught in an underage online sex solicitation. Staying, which is not surprising. Ritter had sent graphic video to this person that he believed was 15, including him naked and masturbating. In April 2001. Ritter was caught in a stain where he thought he was talking to a miner online who he made plans to meet at a McDonald's. He arrived at the McDonald's where the police were waiting, but he didn't end up getting any jail time for that or and they believe the charges were dropped. Former UN weapons inspectors get a warning on these kinds of things, I guess. Then in June 2001. A couple months later, he got caught again, this time trying to meet up with a minor at a Burger King. Again, the police were there and again, he didn't get in any serious trouble. Raider was convicted in the 2009 case and sentenced to five and a half years in prison. He was paroled early and has been out of jail since 2014. But he is very clearly a habitual predator who has a history of seeking out minors online for sexual exploitation. I mentioned Ritter in one of our 2004 episodes in the context that he had been a figure saying that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. And I failed to bring up this aspect of his character. It slipped my mind to get into because I wasn't talking about Ritter, specifically at the time, it was in the context of narratives about David Kelly. And Ritter was a tertiary figure. And I apologize that I didn't bring that up when when his name came up. Now that we have him here on Alex's show, all of this is very relevant. And this is what Alex is trying to present our dirty tricks that were played against Ritter. These weren't dirty tricks. They are multiple instances of Ritter attempting to abuse children. Alex pretends that he's a champion and Crusader out to protect the children. But here he has a convicted sex offender on his show. And all he can do is whitewash his past and his crimes. And why because Reiter is a staunch opponent of Ukraine in the context of the war against Russia. That's his value to Alex and he's he's an anti Ukrainian voice with a resume including the UN's web we and weapons inspector he's going oh, yeah, yeah, keeping keep that in mind anytime you hear Alex scream about all his enemies are pedophiles and how he you know wants to ban trans people from any public existence in order to save the children. He's happy to pal around with and defend any child abuser who agrees with him because he's not sincere about this issue. In the recent past, Ritter has been welcomed a little bit into communities that like to brand themselves as like isolationist but are really kind of about something now. So Nazis. Yeah, yeah. He was scheduled to speak at the Rage Against the War Machine rally back in February, which was just a collection of shitheads. Jimmy Dore Ron Paul Tulsi Gabbard, Gerald Cilenti, Max Blumenthal, Jackson Henkel, and sex past Scott Ritter, people started pointing out who Ritter was. So he got the boot from that speaking engagement, but apparently Alex has no problem welcoming them with open arms and pretending that he was actually the victim and all of those cases. Yeah, what a piece of shit. Yeah. Like, I don't care what he has to say about how we're about to have a nuclear war. Nope. Which is basically the rest of the episode. Yeah,
