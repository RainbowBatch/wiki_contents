'''William Charles Ayers''' (born December 26, 1944) is an educator, an author and former member of the Weather Underground.

For years, [[Alex Jones]] has used Ayers as an example of a “government/foundation funded left wing terrorist,” so it was very strange when Bill Ayers appeared as a guest on [[The Alex Jones Show|Alex’s show]] on January 20, 2015.

The interview was a disaster for Alex, as he quickly realizes that he can’t prove any of the things he says about Ayers, and that Ayers is much smarter than him. You can watch [https://youtu.be/ip2DOl1QMW0 the interview in full] and see Alex flounder when he’s given the opportunity to actually talk to one of his big villains.
