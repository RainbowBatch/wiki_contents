Yeah, it's huge. So Jordan, today we have an episode to go over and just be talking about a special report that Alex put out on Saturday, September 24 2022. Oh, god. No, no, no, this isn't a blackjack? No, it does not have it we. So at the end of last week, Alex had a blow up in court. And I did get a little bit of feedback that on our last episode, where we talked to Elizabeth Williamson did not give a whole lot of context for what was going on in the courtroom when Alex was having his blow up. And so that is fair. Yeah. And one of the reasons for this was that I had some clips that I had prepared, but we had some recording difficulties. And I wasn't able to use a recording software that would allow us to use clips, of course, and so we had our interview and, you know, the familiarity that the three of us had with what had happened totally, I got into that headspace where it's a little inside baseball horse and I apologize, we should have done a little bit better job of laying some of the groundwork.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:04:58.000
    | text      = Yeah, yeah, it is a little bit weird when all three of us have missed maybe two to three minutes of this entire trial. Yeah, you know? Yeah. Like, how are we going to?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:05:06.000
    | text      = Yeah, it's tough. It's an unfair expectation that people should come to the show having already known all these worse. Yeah. And so I mean, but when I reflect on it a little more, it is almost as easy as saying Alex had a blow up. Really? It really is. There is not a ton of more to it. There was he was being questioned about his coverage of Robbie Parker and Chris Mehdi asked him questions along the lines of you put a target on this guy's back, did you not? And then Alex got really mad started saying about liberals wanted to kill people interact there

    | text      = meanwhile, Norm Pattis was yelling objection over and over for anything.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:05:54.000
    | text      = And without the reason it was like it was like a TV show where somebody is pretending to be a lawyer. And they just shout objection. And the judge has to be like, you have to have a reason. And norm was like, I'm a real technical lawyer in the universe.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:06:08.000
    | text      = He's unbelievable. Objection more than Shakira. Song. All right. See ya. I mean, they they had the jury leave the courtroom. And the judge was confused by the fact that norm was objecting to things that Alex was saying, right, as opposed to things that the other counsel was saying, right. And over the course of the day, it had happened repeatedly that norm would make an objection, the judge would sustain it. And Alex will have already answered the question. He won't stop talking. Yeah, there's an issue there. And so she constantly tried to explain to him when your lawyer objects stop talking. Absolutely. Because you might not have to answer that question. It was him he did not seem to get that didn't register?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:06:54.000
    | text      = No, no, it was it was like watching a T ball game where the kid hit the tee three straight times. And they're like, well, technically, that's a strikeout, but this is T ball. So I'm gonna put it right back on that T one more time. All right, Alex, you can do this, you hit the ballpark. Not that deep. Oh, well, maybe next time.

    | timestamp = 00:07:28.000
    | text      = no. Well, the truth, if you answer yes or no, makes him look real bad. And the issue there is, which I feel like we don't fully all understand in the courtroom. The reason that they look bad is because he's guilty. And he's already

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:07:45.000
    | text      = Well, sure, sure. But I mean, when you answer those questions, that you can't, you can't answer in a way that's like, Ah, maybe I'm gonna get off on this one. No, you did it. It's already been decided.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:07:55.000
    | text      = Yeah. So that happened on Thursday. And then on Friday, Norm announced that Alex was not going to be cross examined, he was going to waive his right to cross examine, because Alex was going to leave town. He was going back to Austin, it was a surprise move. Yeah. And they reserve the right to call him again. Apparently, early this week, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday, he's due to be back right? To be questioned some more.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:08:23.000
    | text      = Yeah, I believe if Maddie doesn't call him Maddie reserves the right to call him again under subpoena because that's what you would have to do at this point. But Norm has also said he's going to plan to call him to testify and on his own behalf. And the main reason so he can actually monologue and not have to answer yes or no questions, basically.

But then you go into reorganization where it sets the benchmark for how much money you actually have. So we can stay on air continue to operate and also show to the state courts, everybody else, when they claim a foreigner million dollars, like they falsely did the Texas show trial four weeks ago, we can show certified all this stuff. That's just a lie. And then that allows Infowars free speech systems to stay on air and continue to operate because they have federal laws, where you're not supposed to just be able to sue somebody and shut them down for we're very transparent about that. It's, it's why we're doing it. And I'll just address this now here. I've never been in bankruptcy. We've never even taken loans here.

And I said, Let's just put all the cards on the table, go into bankruptcy, and then most lawyers don't want to work with us. Most people don't work with us, but I got some good lawyer.

The judge ruled last week, Judge Lopez in Texas had not been transparent about everything they'd done in the past not not bad things. But the fact that they publicly done our last bankruptcy, Democrats came back. So we got Infowars the website back and Infowars health it's a successful company, and some other things was a very real bankruptcy that was tied to free speech systems to like, quote, pay debtors.

I mean, to be honest with you from a pure legal perspective, law lawyer perspective, this has been very incompetent representation. I mean, these parents have had ineffective representation. I understand that this is a very politically powerful connected law firm in Connecticut. But I heard from many people who are on the plaintiff side in this case, who thought that the plaintiff's lawyer was terrible. And it's because he's more politically motivated to prosecute this case, it appears to me that he is actually getting to truth or justice because actual justice would rule against him and actual truth is, in fact against them. And that's why he can't that's why he's stuck in this situation, trying to do a Soviet style Stasi style, Cuban Fidel Castro style show trial, but can't achieve it.

And that is precisely what's been taking place. And what were the issues concerning Sandy Hook, which is it turns out the politicians pocketed the money rather than put school safety first. And if they had done so if they'd done something as simple as allow teachers to lock the inside of the doors of the bathrooms inside their classrooms, be able to lock the inside of the doors into their classrooms, be able to have other means of self defense available, such as trained people with guns in the teachers and school safety personnel, then the reality is a lot of those kids are alive today. But the politicians couldn't let that message get out. And the reality is the Democratic Party, he didn't like the fact that you put up a poll it Info Wars that asked what might be a future false flag. But that's because what's the political reality right now? The political reality right now is the more school shootings happen. The more plaintiff's lawyers like his firm profit, the more school shootings happen, the more the Democratic Party with their gun control agenda, profit.

They don't want to talk about inadequacies of school safety, because that didn't pay to the Democratic politicians and political class in Connecticut. And they don't want to talk about culture, that glamorizes violence because it's a culture they profit from.

So we turn the email over, they know how to scan them, and magically find the secret links highlighted and Chris gets up there and says, Okay, you filed a lawsuit against the Young Turks that you filed, just to get them to stop saying I'm a child pornographer and all this. He said, Yeah, it's true. The FBI said you didn't do anything. It was said to you. You didn't know but But then an hour later, he says show you did sin child porn. Let's just admit it. You did it.

    | text      = That's not what Alex said. Alex said. Yes. Yeah. Alex fully understands what Maddie was asking him. But he's pretending not to because he doesn't want his audience to understand the situation. Yeah, Maddie was asking Alex about how he had sued the Young Turks over statements they'd made about sending child porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiff's lawyers. This was meant to really make it clear that when he's on the other side of things, Alex fully understands how damaging defamatory claims can be, and that he's more than willing to sue people for making such claims. Happily, Maddie was very clear that the FBI had looked into it, and the emails hadn't been opened, and they were sent to Alex, and they were turned over unknowingly, which is why Alex felt in the right to sue. However, if the claim was just that, quote, Alex Jones sent lawyers child porn and emails, then that claim is technically true. It wasn't intentional. And Alex didn't know what was in the emails. But those emails did get sent from Alex's team to the plaintiffs, and they did contain child porn. This is what the tweet said that was included in Alex's complaint against the Young Turks, which is why Maddie was making this distinction. The thing that Alex was suing over was a statement that was technically accurate, accurate, but was suggestive in a way that could lead to reputational damage. This was all to illustrate that Alex's posturing and defiance in this case are decisions that he's making. And then he's more than happy to use the courts as a weapon when he feels aggrieved, even if the technical claim that was being made and being called defamation. Yeah, is strictly speaking accurate.
