    | timestamp = 00:10:38.000
    | text      = Hey, it's Tucker Carlson. Let's say you wanted to control a country. Tucker, how would you start, we'd want to make sure you had the complete obedience of everybody inside your borders, who was authorized to use deadly force, he would start with the military, and then federal law enforcement and move your way down ultimately to agencies like the IRS. Controlling the guns would be a top priority for you if you went in for wanting to go dictatorial if you wanted to be baby doc. But let's say you had deeper ambitions. Let's say you wanted the power not simply to control people's behavior, but to control how they think not just their bodies, but their minds as a god would. In that case, you need to take charge of the society's taboos. A taboo is something that by popular consensus is not allowed. A taboo may not be illegal, but it doesn't need to be. Over time. Social prohibitions are more powerful and more enduring the laws. Societies are defined by what they will not permit, as are famously, religions. Muslims don't eat pork. Now they're Orthodox Jews. Traditional Christians, oppose extramarital sex, the Amish avoid electricity and so on.

I think so. Yeah. But I also think that, you know, you wouldn't be able to have total control, I think almost in any scenario, even if you owned all the police and all the military, and controlled all of his cultural taboos, I don't think you'd be able to have complete control over people's thoughts and minds. No, but I kind of, I kind of do got to give it up to him a little bit, that I think that you know, social norms and cultural, if you want to call it taboos are things that lead often to law check, you know, like, things like the, you know, changing opinions surrounding civil rights, led to codification of the Civil Rights Act, you know, things it flowed in that direction. And so you could kind of argue that, you know, cultural opinions have more of a powerful effect, you know,

What we're allowed to dislike is being dictated to us from above, sometimes by force. until fairly recently, for example, it was taboo in this country to attack people on the basis of the race. That was the main last until fairly recently, we're told again and again, the one thing we learned from the Nazis is that it's dangerous to reduce human beings to their genetic code. There is no master race. That made sense.

Because the other ones that he listed, they fall into a particular category that you could call things that society decided to look down upon because they were associated with marginal groups, mostly the poor. Stealing has never been taboo in this country, as long as you're rich. Corporate theft and wage theft have been the order of the day for generations. And if anything, the prevailing attitude towards the rich people who did the stealing was of aspiring to be like them. The people who were stigmatized because of stealing were the people who had to steal to survive. That was the taboo, needing to steal Yeah, flaunting your wealth has also never been taboo, so long as you're rich. It's only taboo to flaunt your wealth or to be perceived to be if you're a member of a group that society expects to be poor. Consider the example of like the editorials about millennials needing to stop buying avocado toast. If you aren't rich, showing any signs of affluence would typically cause accusations of irresponsibility or even make people suspicious. Like masterpiece add on more to life from the last dawn.

Smoking weed on the street has also probably only been taboo because of the history of how propaganda about the drug was used to malign Black and Hispanic populations. And the criminalization of it was the driving force of a drug war that needlessly destroyed countless lives. Yeah, smoking tobacco on the street isn't taboo, and yet, you're theoretically causing harm to the people around you. Caffeine is no less of a drug and you can drink coffee on the street.

If you need help and accept that help you take on a stigma. When you're a big corporation or a rich asshole and you profit from subsidies or government large s you don't take on any of that stigma. If you're a landowner who takes a paycheck from the government for not using your land to grow crops, like a friend of mine for my childhoods dad did.

No one really cares if someone's a hypocrite and hitting women still very much not smiled upon by society. Yeah, the other four examples of things where it's becoming less stigmatized to be in a marginalized class, and to do the thing that rich people have been doing all along. Yeah. The issue with the way Tucker is using this list is that he tries to transpose this diminishing of these taboos onto the idea that child molestation is a taboo that's falling. This is ridiculous and pretty offensive on its face. The argument fails in a bunch of ways. But what's important here is to track the argument that Tucker is making and how it flows. Here, he's set up an establishing point, which is that society's taboos are eroding of their moral force. And that means that child molestation will soon lose its status as unacceptable to society. So that's, that's where we are. That's sort of the the base which this house is going to be built on. Right. And by the way, when I said house right there, I want to point this out.

Hey, Tucker conveniently leaves off there that Rittenhouse was acquitted of that charge and that he's made a bunch of money off his killings into his generally faced minimal consequence. You know, before we get into any of that clip, let's keep track of this argument. In this section Tucker is trying to provide evidence for his conclusion that child molestation is no longer taboo. The evidence is that people wanted to make Jeffrey Dahmer his killer a folk hero and people were mad at Kyle Rittenhouse. That's not good evidence. For one thing Dahmer did a whole lot more than molest children. Yeah, he ate them.

The person who killed Dahmer may have killed him because of his crimes, but he also killed another inmate at the same time, so it might have just been a violent flare up that we're attributing to Dumars crimes, so that we can have narrative satisfaction of feeling like Dahmer got what he deserved.

There's one other way which is to say that you can post hoc justify any violence committed against someone if their past is bad enough. Yeah. Joseph Rosenbaum had done time for molesting children. So there's no moral consideration for shooting and killing him. Even if you had no idea who he was at the time of the shooting. This is a horrific way to approach any ethical or legal structure.

Yeah, that's ridiculous. That's absurd. Yeah, Tucker is intentionally distorting the situation in order to suit his premise that child molestation is no longer taboo. Because society thinks it's not cool to kill an unarmed person at a protest and that people deserve moral consideration regardless of past crimes. That means that the powers that be are fine with child molesters. Now, this is beyond nonsensical.

Okay, so it's meant Instagram connects pedophiles and connects them to content sellers. So it's all private corporation. In one instance, the paper discovered that Instagram was recommending the phrase incest toddlers to users who have expressed interest in similar material, right? private corporate data, we know that Instagram has denied that any of this had happened.

As we follow this argument, Tucker is now asserting that the powers that be don't view child molesters as the worst of the worst, because the Wall Street Journal reported on this Instagram stuff and nothing was done. But that's not entirely true. In the wake of this revelation, meta set up a specific task force to address this and provide more human based moderation, as well as blocking certain search terms and hashtags. That's definitely not enough. And it's probably a fundamental problem with social media sites as a whole. There's so large and so many users with so many, only so much moderation capability that people who want to do horrific shit will probably continue to find ways to get around those rules. Even if that is the case, that just means that the people running those sites have to dedicate far more resources towards being aggressive in their approach towards moderation tried to be one step ahead, Matt and said that they're going to do that, but we'll see. I'm not I don't know how much faith we can have in that as a private company. Yeah. And because too restrictive of like, a way to like, let's say, for instance, they wanted to try and cut down on all this stuff by requiring a social security number, or some kind of like, like Twitter did with the the verification shit or something that is going to cut down on your user base, which cuts into your overhead, right? So trying to, like fully safeguard this stuff, you know, things that they could do, unfortunately, run into their, their bottom line. So they'll do things that will try to help and ideally, hopefully, will help, but as long as the motivation and their primary reason to exist is financial right?

    | text      = What what what is happening? What? So here's where you start to see Tucker getting to, you know, kind of maybe what he actually has feelings about? Yeah, this is about extreme right wingers being the new child molesters in terms of being the worst people in society. This is exactly the argument you would expect from someone who takes the abuse and exploitation of children very seriously. Yeah, most people aren't into the use of the term minor attracted person. And one of the higher profile people who have promoted its use got a lot of shit over it. That was Dr. Alan Walker of Old Dominion University, who was put on administrative leave and then resigned. Due to the fallout, there is a conversation that people have surrounding harm reduction that says that there's a difference between someone who is attracted to underage persons and doesn't act on it, and someone who does act on it. There's a side of that discussion that contends that you can't really control who you're attracted to. So someone doesn't choose that attraction, but they can choose to act or not. This school of thought, argues that people who choose not to act on that attraction should be treated differently than those who offend. And that by doing so, it might be possible to minimize the harm that's actually done in the real world. Part of that different treatment may be something like coming up with a different term marrow. I'm not sure where I come down on this necessarily, because I haven't done enough looking into it to feel confident either way. But I do know that there's a very concerted effort on the part of the right wing media to use terms like minor attracted person to argue that society is trying to mainstream child exploitation, and that it's being adopted by the LGBTQ plus community. This is obviously just a means to target, marginalize and slander the LGBTQ plus community. That's the use the Tucker has for it in this narrative, and it's entirely disconnected from any desire to minimize harm. That's done to children. Yeah, the pivot to talking about the 2020 election deniers and January 6 writers is incredibly forced, because it has to be this is the kind of the destination that Tucker was aiming towards, and he didn't really have a sensible path. So you had to go with a shoehorn, like, it's It's bizarre.

It also seems like a bigger problem than these drug cartels that apparently controlled large swaths of the country and have killed hundreds of 1000s of Americans. I'm guessing Tucker means that these deaths happen because of those like the drug murders. Yeah, but he's vague enough that the image is terrifying. It does seem that way. And answer the question of defining white supremacy and white nationalism. Tucker should just ask his staff they definitely know Yeah, he can ask his old buddy and former head writer Blake Neff, who had to resign after his racist message board posts are revealed, including some weird instances where things posted on the forum mirrored things that would show up on Tucker show. The former editor of his site to The Daily Caller named Scott Greer got busted posting racist articles for Richard Spencer's outlet under a pen name. They used to publish the writing of Jason Kessler, one of the organizers of the unite the right rally. I think if Tucker is looking for some clarity on exactly what white nationalists and racists want and are about, he has access to a lot more primary sources than most people. We've certainly gone far afield from what seemed like the topic of this piece, which was the erosion of taboos in America leading to child molestation being normalized as evidenced by people being mad at Kyle Rittenhouse on the fact that there have been more January six related FBI press releases this month. This is a pretty poorly constructed monologue. I have to say, yeah, yeah. I've never really watched his TV show. So I don't really know if this is better or worse. Yeah.

But if I had to guess I would assume that in the course of SDG and E's investigation of his employment they found cause that merited termination. Here's the basis for my suspicion. The first point is that there was a massive outcry about this case and not just from the normal right wing shithead Kancil culture crowd the Antek wrote about it and Cafferty was featured on an episode of Monica Lewinsky series 15 minutes of shame. The person who tweeted this picture came forward and said that they misinterpreted it even like everyone was that guy, but you know, this was no good. Okay, so everybody,

When the light turned green. Cafferty drove off hoping to put an end to this disconcerting encounter. But when carefully reached another red light, the man now holding a cell phone camera was there again. Do it do it, he shouted, unsure what to do.

And then Cafferty filed two lawsuits, one against SDG and E and the other against the guy who tweeted the picture. Sure. On October 26 of last year, Cafferty himself filed to dismiss the case against the tweeter with prejudice, meaning that it's not an action he can re introduce his suit against SG SDG. And E for defamation went the exact same route except that he requested to be dismissed without or with prejudice on June 1 2023, only two weeks ago. There are some other possibilities of what could be going on. It's imaginable that Cafferty realized that he would have a very difficult time proving defamation claims, but he may be still intending to pursue like an unjust termination case against SDG and E. They've stood against their or they they've stood by their decision, though, and I can't find any evidence of other suits being filed. So I'm not sure what you really think, okay. It's a weird situation, like I don't know if any reason or evidence to suggest that he was making a racist hand gesture when he was photographed and all indications point to it being really inappropriate that this person tweeted what they did. Having said that, I don't know enough about this case, to say that this is the ultimate reason he got fired. In the case that he was it was an employer trying to cover their ass by firing someone, then I would be on Cafferty side, in the case that there was grounds for his terminate termination.

The culmination of this monologue, the go home message seems to be a bit weird. On the one hand, Tucker is saying that our country should be governed by taboos which grow and evolve with the times. But simultaneously, he's saying to the audience that they need to hold fast to their taboos, if, as if their life depended on it, steadfastly refusing to change from the innate wisdom about right and wrong that they had from birth.
