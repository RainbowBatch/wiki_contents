Today, Dan and Jordan set out to see how Alex Jones is doing in the aftermath of Roger Stone having to settle a lawsuit about how he lied about a guy on InfoWars. What they found was unsatisfying on that front, but they did find Alex spending a day yelling about Ben Shapiro, and a second day of him being a real dick about a child whose life he disagrees with.
