He has worked closely with [[Mark Bankston]] on all the InfoWars related defamation cases in Texas.

Bill has appeared on Knowledge Fight as a guest ([[664: Formulaic Objections Part 5|on Episode 664]]). Among Knowledge Fight fans he is especially known for his tactic of making depositions subjects uncomfortable by eating a large bag of gummy worms.

Bill has stated that he and Mark Bankston form an effective sort of "Good Cop, Bad Cop" pair in their approach to the legal process. Bill is the bad cop.
