Today, Dan and Jordan take a break from talking about [[Alex Jones]] to take a much needed [[Project Camelot]] break. On this episode, the gents discuss a difficult interview that Sweary Kerry did with a guy who liberated Mars back in the 1970's. Also, Dan found an album Kerry recorded a few years back, and Jordan thinks it slaps.
