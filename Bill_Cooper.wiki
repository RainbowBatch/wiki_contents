'''Bill Cooper''' was an American conspiracy theorist and author who gained notoriety in the 1990s for his radio show "The Hour of the Time" and his book "[[Behold a Pale Horse]]". Cooper was a forerunner of [[Alex Jones]] and modern conspiracy theorists, espousing many of the same beliefs and promoting similar ideas about government cover-ups, secret societies, and hidden agendas.

One of Cooper's most disgusting claims was his denial of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995, in which 168 people were killed. Cooper accused the US government of staging the attack as part of a larger conspiracy to further restrict Americans' freedoms.

In November 2001, Cooper was killed in a shootout with police at his home in Arizona, after he resisted arrest on charges of tax evasion and assault.
