Proud of the app so he took another vacation was at a studio all week and left Owen Shroyer in charge of the ship II. And so that made things a little bit tough. And now we arrived back here on Monday's episode and Alex is still been out of studio and I decided that what we should do is go back and look at a little bit of the stuff that happened over the course of the especially the beginning of the week. And see the response to the club cue shooting. Yeah, Colorado Springs. Yeah, I feel like that is worth touching on and seeing how they covered it. Even though it wasn't Alex himself. It was Owen Shroyer, who is leading the charge in the studio. And so yeah, that's what we're gonna look at here. We're gonna talk a bit about November 20 and 21st Boy,

    | timestamp = 00:12:45.000
    | text      = Yeah. And there isn't there isn't a whole lot going on here outside of a Canadian impression. Metaphorically. Yeah. So on the evening of November 19, a 22 year old named Anderson Aldrich entered club Q and LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs and open fire. They killed two five people and 25 others were injured in the attack. This story is first and foremost a tragedy and another sign of the rising tide of anti LGBTQ violence in no small part facilitated and encouraged by modern right wing media that accuses all members of their community of being pedophiles who are out to groom your children, Alex and ever wanted Infowars is complicit in that trend. And the natural endpoint of promoting and normalizing that mentality is that some people who internalize it and accept it as truth may be inspired to take matters into their own hands. Beyond being a tragedy, this case is also a complete fucking mess. The accused shooter Aldrich is the grandson of a right wing California politician who supported the January 6 riots, and is the son of a very homophobic former porn star who went by the name Dick Delaware, who also appeared on an episode of intervention because he was addicted to meth. To complicate matters even further, Aldrich, lawyers have claimed that Aldrich is non binary and wants to be referred to when they them pronouns, which has caused a lot of varying reactions for people. The prevailing attitude people seem to have is that this is a ploy to dodge potential hate crime penalties in the case, since they'd never spoken about this prior, and they were known to routinely use anti LGBTQ slurs. People were very shocked to see an interview with their dad where he expressed his surprise hearing his son was involved in an incident at a gay bar, not because five people were murdered, but because he was concerned that his son was gay. It's really awful to see but in the interview, he also says that he hasn't been in Aldrich his life for over a decade and he doesn't come off as a very sober interview subject. Even though he hasn't been in his son's life. He does say that he raised his child to know that being gay is wrong and that fighting is the answer to conflict. He seems like a shit influence even though he's very clear that he's talking about hand to hand combat and that guns and murder are not good. Good, distinct When great on top of all this Aldrich his mother called the police after Aldrich made a bomb threat targeted at her but as is too often the case charges weren't pressed, and Aldrich was able to keep his guns. I do believe that Aldrich could have made that bomb threat but also the mom is not a great source of information either. From an article in CNN quote in 2009 Aldrich, his mother received three years of probation for convictions of public intoxication and falsely reporting a crime to the police. The false report conviction stemmed from a 2008 incident in Beretta California in which police responded to a reported home invasion and found vocal lying on her bed with her hands and legs bound with duct tape. Vocal initially told the police a man had put string around her neck bound her with tape and placed a knife on her chest. She admitted the following day, however, that she had been under the influence of narcotics and fabricated the incident because, quote, she was lonely, unwanted attention. A police report states, all of this just completely makes me feel ill. And at the end of the day, I feel terrible for what Aldrich clearly had to live with growing up, but that doesn't really matter anymore. People who have had more difficult challenges have somehow managed not to murder five people with clear intentions to kill many more. I just want to send all the love and support I can to the survivors and friends and families of those last caller in Colorado Springs, as well as all of our LGBTQ family. Anyway, it was somewhat convenient that Alex was out of studio last week, because that meant that we didn't have to talk about his coverage of the shooting. But I think that it's actually important to loop back and take a look at this. My reasoning takes into account a few things. The first is that it's relevant to understand Infowars angle on this story. The second is something that I thought was a little bit more compelling, which is that the right wing media's coverage of this attack has been indefensible in a way that I think does feel a lot different for a lot of folks than other times in the past. For instance, Tim Poole took to Twitter to rationalize the shooting as the natural reaction to the idea that club Q had a quote grooming event, which is the way he characterized a drag brunch the club was hosting. He had a sickening take the legislation needed to be passed and police needed to stop events like all age drag brunches from happening. But because that wasn't happening, it only makes sense that people would try to solve the problem with violence. In this clip where he's trying to be like a piece of shit troll, I noticed that he slipped a little bit. Now he's just trolling as a whole with this question that he's presenting. It's not a sincere question. But see if you can notice where he slips up a little bit.

    | text      = A bunch of goddamn pedophiles are grooming children. And when we're like, hey, stop associating all LGBT people with groomers. Y'all keep fucking doing it. So here's what happened. I tweeted. If you claim that groomer refers to all LGBT people, then you are calling all LGBT people groomers, and you're inciting violence against them stop inciting violence against them.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:18:02.000
    | text      = For one he knows damn well, that right wing figures use the term groomer as a catch all for their anti LGBTQ bigotry. It's a cute game he's playing here, but in order to take it seriously, you'd have to imagine that Tim has never talked to or listened to any of the people who come on to his show as guests. The slip up I was talking about is that he says LGBT pee. He says that because he hangs out with a community of people who use that term to imply that pedophiles are an inherent part of and distinct group within the LGBTQ community. It's a hard slip up to make too because it requires him to pronounce the P sound twice in a row, which he did to say LGBT pee people. Yep. Yeah. It's a little bit telling. Yeah. Matt Walsh is another figure that has decided to dip his toes into the waters of justifying mass murder because of his own prejudice. He put out a video on YouTube where he said, quote, is it that hard to not cross dress in front of kids? Is the compulsion that overwhelming? If it's causing this much chaos and violence? Why do you insist on continuing to do it? The trend among these figures is that they've decided to push the idea that the shooting well probably unfortunate is justifiable because drag branches exist. They paint the picture that the drag brunch is what's causing the violence. And if these LGBTQ folks who had just agreed to exist in the constrictive boundaries, that the right wing extremist figures in the media demand, then the violence would stop. This behavior is legitimately very difficult for me to distinguish from making veiled terrorist threats. It's all bullshit. It's not even a sincere point that someone like Matt Walsh is making and it all makes me completely sick. Yeah. The types of reactions that we see from these ostensibly more mainstream figures are the sort of things you'd usually normally just hear in places like Infowars. But now, daily wire pundits and Tucker Carlson are walking all the way up to the Infowars line, and debatably crossing it. As such, I felt it would be helpful to accurately get a sense of what Infowars coverage consisted of in the aftermath. This episode that we're going to be covering here It starts with November 20, the day after the shooting, when Owen was filling in for Alex, this is a Sunday show. So it begins at 4pm. Central twins, there's no reason for them not to be aware of a lot of the primary details by the time Oh, and gets on air. You know, you look mad.

    | text      = Oh, man. So you can see here as Owen begins to bring up the story of the shooting in the space of 24 seconds he implants three separate suggestions to distract the audience from the possibility that this was a mass shooting directed at a community that his show and his employer target routinely with ridiculous slander and accusations. First, Owen couches the conversation in terms of discussing the liberal media's response to the shooting because that's more fertile territory for him. He doesn't have the chops to actually discuss the shooting itself but yelling a bunch of dumb shit about random tweets he saw is basically the same thing on Infowars. Yep. Second, oh, and says that this was a quote, suppose it gay club. He knows that if the target of a mass shooting was a gay club, there's a high likelihood that a potential motive is homophobia or transphobia, which are the primary drivers of Infowars content in order to create distance in the audience's mind between the possible motive for the shooting and the rhetoric they hear every day. Oh, and tries to subtly suggest that it's not actually a gay bar. If all went wanted to do a tiny bit of research, he could have found their website and seeing that instead of serving aoli fries. They have gay only for eyes on their menu, which is a subtle hint, very subtle. He could have checked out their drink menu and seen that quote, COC shots are on the menu, which are described as quote, Jello Shots dispensed through a white or brown caulk shaped syringe chair. They also have a shot called become shot, which is fire whiskey and Bailey's. All right.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:33:58.000
    | text      = I'm not into it. No, me neither. the Wayback Machine has snapshots of their site going back to 2004, where they're described as, quote, the premier gay restaurant and nightclub. Their phone number is 571. Gay. I say this with nothing but love and respect. This is not a supposed gay club. It's in no one's interest to muddy the waters though. So he throws that in to plant seeds of suspicion in the listener. And actually, if this is more important than it may seem, an article about club Q was published in the Colorado Springs indie in July 2020. With the headline quote, Colorado Springs last remaining gay bar club que changes with the times. That article is a fascinating tale of the queer history of Colorado Springs, and how it went from a severely anti LGBTQ environment in the 90s to town with a vibrant community and a bunch of gay bars to this point in 2020, where there was just this one gay bar left in town because as technology advanced, you didn't need to have a specific LGBTQ bar for people to meet up. They could use apps and online dating And so many of the other bars became, quote, gay friendly, but club Q, the co owner, Nick gradisca, told the indie about a former bar they worked at quote, when people would call us and ask if we were a gay bar, I was instructed to say we were a gay friendly bar, not an explicitly gay bar. But that's not enough. Club Q was supposed to be explicitly gay. And as graskop put it, quote, the whole idea of this place was to have a safe place to get a permanent one in the city. This is the place that no one is suggesting is maybe not actually a gay bar because he's an idiot who just talks shit and he doesn't know anything about the subjects he covers. The third thing he does is he gets all weird about the club being called Club Q, which he totally isn't saying has anything to do with queueing on stuff totally not. He's doing this because the audience is trained to associate things that are connected to the cue folks to be a globalist SIOP. Yep. So that was one of the one of the main defenses that Alex deployed about why January 6, wasn't actually the Patriots fault.

So unless Q anon has been going on since the George W. Bush administration, and therefore it actually predates the Tea Party, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Yeah. If I had to guess, because I can't really nail this down. Exactly. I would say that maybe the club was named after club Q, the long running dance party for queer women in San Francisco that began in like the mid 80s. Yeah, that's just a guess. But it's also worth noting that a lot of queer oriented things use the letter Q Yeah, absolutely. As reason. Yes. Anyway, as you can tell, right out of the gate, Owen is invested in throwing out distractions to get away from the heart of the issue. And I think that it's pretty fucking obvious why

In regards to the heinousness of the crime being a hate crime, if you are attacking a place that's explicitly safe for gay people than it is by nature, a an explicitly homophobic crime, regardless of motive or intent, right, because I don't give a fuck what his brain or what their brain suggests is the motive behind their attack, the attack itself is the motive.

Yes, that makes no sense. That's insane. Also, this is a dishonest argument. Oh, and isn't arguing for anything political or even productive. At the core, he's saying that people shouldn't care about the club Q shooting. That's the point of this presentation. He's pushing back against people caring about a mass shooting at a gay bar where five people were killed, and many more would have been if the shooter hadn't been beaten up by brave bar patrons. Obviously, other shootings are tragic as well. And they are all indicative of problems that we need to address. The issue comes down to these not being analogous situations.

    | text      = look at this convoluted people like Owen and Alex Stein have a political ideology that says that they should support armed citizens Brexit and the Second Amendment, even if they disagree with the concept of drag queen storytime it should be antithetical to their gun absolutism to mock people for carrying in public. And this is why it's important to understand that they don't actually really care about guns. I mean, they care about guns and they want them but they want what they represent more. They want the ability to impose mortal fear and political enemies and couch it in a philosophical love for the Constitution. Yeah, for instance, they want folks to the their team to be armed to the teeth when they go to protest at a reproductive health clinic. So the people seeking care or the clinic staff are terrified. Or if they're protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, they want people on their side to be armed and wandering around acting as vigilantes that is good for them. Conversely, they don't want principled gun owners to protect the targets of their attacks. They mock carrying guns here when the people are outside of drag queen storytime or if armed citizens were to post up at an abortion clinic. They don't want guns in these contexts because of what those guns represent, which is that vulnerable communities may not be as vulnerable as you want them to be. It's incredibly distasteful for them to be playing this the day after the shooting. Alex Stein is just mocking the idea of armed citizens protecting a drag queen storytime, which is the exact type of event that people like Tim Poole and Matt Walsh would go on to use as a justification for why the shooting maybe wasn't so bad. Also, Stein is is really bad at this. He strikes me as the kid in like high school play Who's overacting? He's hamming it up a little bit too much, because he knows that no one would pay attention to him if he really was subtle, because he doesn't have a subtle mode now, and he sucks. He's just not good.

    | text      = Well think that most people on the left wherever that thrilled with what Elon was up to with Twitter, I don't know what kind of charade Alex is trying to pull here. The entire first segment of the show is Alex shilling his supplements and book desperately begging for money. And now the second segment is clearly just Alex complaining about Elon Musk. This is an important dynamic to understand for a few reasons. The first is that Alex really can't disappear for too long because no one else moves product at nearly the rate he does. If he wants to take time off, he does kind of need to pop in and do shit like this to reassure the audience that he's still there and remind them that they need to give money to the cult leader. These people will not tie for Owen or Harrison, but Alex can coax that out of them. You got it. The second is that from a content perspective, the club Q shooting is not relevant enough for Alex to address on the show in the limited time that he has to appear while he's on vacation. However, what's super important for him to talk about is that Elon Musk mentioned him on Twitter. Yep, he doesn't cover news it not he's not a competent talk show host but he's amazing at wrangling attention. He's done it since the VHS and bullhorn day And now the technology and social media has evolved. This is that equivalent, with Ilan saying that Alex isn't gonna be let back on Twitter, Alex knows that he has an opportunity to get some attention, but it requires him responding to keep the image of a fight alive and the window is short. He needs to, you know, get in there now, because him responding when he gets back from vacation, no one's gonna give a shit. He's gonna look weak yield, self aggrandizing drama is what Alex is most interested in. And Alex probably should have known that Ilan felt this way about him if all the other stories that he tells her true at all. Alex is very strongly implied that he's gone to dinner with Musk because of the Rogan connection. Alex has talked about how Joe has told him that Elon loves him and all this. But now that Musk has come out and publicly said that Alex is a piece of shit and is never getting back on Twitter. I guess all that other stuff didn't happen. And Alex doesn't have to explain why he made it all up just to dazzle the listeners. It's great.

They have similar polls with 300 plus 1000 votes, the height slips did where I had a 10 point lead on the poll of hundreds and hundreds and 1000s of people wanted me to come back.

He just has to pretend that he's actually mad about his Musk comparing himself to Jesus, which I should point out, Alex does about himself all the fucking time nonstop. All Musk did was quote a Bible verse, which if you compare that with Alex's grandiose stories about how God selected him to fight the literal devil, it doesn't really seem like that big of a deal, right?

I don't think he could. No, this is also just a talking point from 2019 that Alex is pulling out of his ass to defend himself because he really doesn't have an actual defense for his actions other than to flail and distract. Yep. Albert Borla is the head of Pfizer and on November 10, he was given the ADLs courage against hate award also a past recipient of that harm do you look kya Chobani right suit Alex. The reason he got this award had to do with well, I'll just quote his acceptance speech here, quote, anti semitic messages on message boards and on flyers posted in communities across the country suggesting that the Coronavirus was a tool for Jews to span expand the global influence that Jews were profiting from COVID and that Jews were the real virus, hate pedalers referred to the Jew vaccine to dissuade others from receiving it. So messages even referred to my own Jewish heritage and use it as evidence that the widespread vaccine effort was part of a calculated long term Jewish plot to institute a global Jew government. It makes sense why Borla got this award given the context of everything and while it's fair to agree or disagree with some of the points that he makes in his speech, he didn't say any of the things Alex is claiming. Alex probably only knows about this speech and there's award at all because of this line. Quote. Now there are bright spots amid this darkness. Just last month, a jury awarded close to a billion dollars to families of those who lost loved ones in the Sandy Hook massacre, because one man with a microphone spoke disgusting and disgraceful lies. The jury flat out rejected his lies and made an unambiguous statement that such evil is not acceptable. That got an applause break from the audience. And Alex is probably just a little pissed off that he didn't actually get a name check.

Yeah, yeah, they reviewed the data with a forensic computer specialist, or two who said that they didn't believe that they saw signs of things being added to the data and that it appeared authentic. Okay. This isn't the same thing as saying that all the absurd right wing media claims about the laptop are confirmed. It's not even saying that the basis for a lot of those claims is authenticated because these people like the Rudy Giuliani's of the world and such, they may be working from a copy of the data that's had files added to them. All the CBS PS can really assert is that the expert they spoke to didn't see signs of tampering in the data directly from the source. This isn't necessarily as much of a win as Owen wants it to be. And he doesn't get to congratulate himself for being part of a media organization that made a ton of shit up about the laptop after an actual media organization does some legwork. That doesn't actually prove Infowars clients. Yeah. Also, I fucking love this segment. I love this development so much. Now, I guess Alex and Infowars need to protect Joe Biden at all costs. If they attack him, they're just doing the globalist bidding because they want Biden out of the way. It's a trap.

Would Owen support that kind of law or would that be a violation of the Second Amendment? If he doesn't support confiscating guns from people who make terrorist bomb threats, then his mention of the past crime doesn't really make sense here it seems irrelevant. What Owen is doing is he's trying to say that this is a false flag without saying it directly. The FBI got in contact with Aldrich after the bomb threat and then used him as a patsy or a Mind Control sleeper agent or some shit.

    | text      = I don't know if the producers are asleep at the wheel or what but I guess Owens just gonna reuse the same headlines he brought up on Sunday's show, which seems a little bit soft. If these are the things he insists no one cares about, I would suggest you look a little bit deeper. The first shooting you mentioned is in Baltimore. And if one were interested, he could check out the Abell Foundation, a nonprofit committed to combating gun violence in Baltimore through investing in community programs that aim to intervene in in an at risk situations and prevent future violence. In 2021, they dispensed over $14 million in grants to community based projects in areas like workforce development, education and the arts. This is a group that takes the problem of gun violence in Baltimore very seriously, and is working to address the underlying causes and influence of it. Or if he wanted to go like a more religious route. He could discuss the Catholic Charities safe streets, Baltimore, there are many other groups too. And this is an issue that's discussed widely. And the secondary to know and brings up is outside Philly. And the same dynamic is true in Philly as it is in Baltimore. There are tons of people with goodwill working hard to create solutions to the problem of violence with community based initiatives. The premise that no one talks about these shootings because they are politically useful or whatever is just false. It's just a one. Yeah. What are the issues with what's going on is there in the right wing there's a rising tide of anti LGBTQ sentiment that a bunch of folks are writing to make a name for themselves in that media sphere. The lives of tick tock account essentially exists solely to demonize trans people and drag performers. Matt Walsh's entire brand now seems to be the guy who's really weird and angry about other people's sexuality and identity. Alex Stein put himself on the map by sexually harassing AOC and I was making antagonistic videos that drag queens storytimes anti trans talking points fueled way more than one GOP midterm campaign. And it would be hard to find a right wing media pundit who didn't traffic in the calling random LGBTQ folks groomers for horrible crimes like being a teacher. In this environment. It's clear that a target is being put on a particular community who are being scapegoated and used as a punching bag for political points. That's a scary and dangerous situation that we all understand leads to violence. We've already seen children's hospitals targeted for bomb threats after being pointed out by libs of Tiktok proud boys have shown up and crashed drag queen stories I'm yelling about grooming kids often well armed, it's crystal clear to anyone paying attention that this is a situation where the ice is thin, and the people who are escalating this tension and raising the temperature have no intention of stopping. So when there's a mass shooting like this at a gay bar, like what we saw in Colorado Springs, it's very easy to understand how that that hits particularly hard for people who care about and respect LGBTQ folk, the writing has been on the wall, let something like this was bound to happen. The people who were inciting hate gleefully continued to do so. And then the horrific happened at the scene. You know, at the time of doing this episode, it does remain to be seen fully what the motive for the shooting was. It's easy to jump to conclusions that this was definitely an anti LGBTQ motivated crime. And I think that the preliminary information points in that direction, but it is possible that there's another another motive there that we're yet to learn. Even if that is the case, it doesn't change anything about why an event like this would be particularly painful. A community suffers a tremendous loss and a deprivation of a place where they felt like they could be safe. Well, that entire media ecosystem demonizes and dehumanizes them and in response, the media ecosystem pretends that the shooting is actually their fault, because they hosted drag brunch events. The actual shooters motive aside the toxicity and fully committed nature of the anti LGBTQ positioning of these right wing figures is on full display. And it's repulsive. Anyway, if Owen wants to continue playing this game, where he has an intern Google shootings that he can pretend to care about, I guess we can do that. But he is very clearly ignoring a very salient difference between things, because it's threatening, and it implicates his worldview. And I just think it's pathetic.

But there's an element that Owen is intentionally ignoring. It's worse that this shooting happened at a gay club because we're currently existing at a time of increased anti LGBTQ rhetoric being normalized at a time when the prevailing attitude and the right wing is that we should regress back to a time when society had absolutely zero tolerance for any non sis non straight identifying person, a shooting that appears to target that community at a time when that rhetoric is flying around the right wing freely, does sting a little more than it might otherwise.

They didn't want to see all the damage done to infrastructure, most of it actually done by Ukraine missiles provided, by the way, I mean, and they don't like seeing their prisoners of war get shot and raped and have their genitals cut off and torture videos. This has all been going on by Ukrainians this year. And so they don't like that. And so you need to understand that the only reason any of that is happening is because of the West backing Ukraine. Ukraine would not have any of this. They would not have the weapons, they would not have the support, they would not have the confidence to committing these to be committing these war crimes and these heinous crimes against Russians against Ukrainians against their own people.

Quick note, though, as you responded to Russia and Ukraine cannot be in a civil war. They're not. That's just not how that works. In essence, Owen is saying that Russia had the right to invade and to seize territory, though it is Ukraine, and that the only reason there's any problem is because Ukraine fought back with some Western support those states terrible Oh, they should have just accepted large areas of their country being taken their president likely publicly executed and Russia installing a puppet head of state. That is Russia's right to do that's what they have the right to do. And because Ukraine didn't go along with it now all this bad stuff is happening. It's actually fairly similar in theme to comments that are coming out about the club cue shooting, particularly the way that Matt Walsh and Tim Poole have framed it. The shooting happened because the club had a drag brunch that they decided to it was a grooming of that. It was the shooters right for there not to be a drag brunch at this bar. But the government of police didn't shut it down for him so he invaded to take care of it. In both cases, there's a state of affairs that they have deemed to be correct. In Ukraine, it's that Russia could do whatever it wants. And in the case of club Q, it's that LGBTQ folks can't do anything if it in any way offends the extreme right wing. Ukraine didn't bend to Russia. demands. So they're really responsible for Russia invading. And the folks that club cute didn't do exactly what the extreme right said. So it's their own fault when violence isn't acted upon them. This is a really troubling mentality.

And I can I can explain this to him, it's actually really simple. For one thing, the people who are going there guarding that event, they weren't there as officials hired by the state, which they would likely have to be if they were there guarding a school that would involve like a super complicated administrative process to happen. Whereas this is just people taking it upon themselves to show up in practice their Second Amendment rights, which everyone should love. Secondly, there's a bit of a difference between these events and schools. If proud boys and groups of right wing lunatics fed a steady diet of sensational and bigoted narratives about how the schools were secret grooming programs targeting kids were showing up at schools routinely to disrupt things. And if there were bomb threats being directed at schools that were pointed out by anti LGBTQ social media accounts, and an entire section of the media was obsessed with demonizing schools and teachers. In that instance, maybe Antifa would show up at schools. That isn't happening in the case of schools, but it is in the case of LGBTQ spaces particularly focused around drag queen storytime, so it kind of makes sense and essence Oh, it is a part of the media ecosystem that is obsesses about these events lies about them sensationalizes them labels people involved in them pedophiles and or demons and then Marvel's at the idea that people would show up to provide security from the people who consume that media and show up to antagonize and disrupt the events.
