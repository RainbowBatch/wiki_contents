Today, Dan tells Jordan about a recent guest on The Alex Jones Show, Jack Posobiec. Jack was a central figure in the French election scandal, #Macronleaks, and he was a guest on the show to spout nonsense about it.

To celebrate his appearance, Dan demonstrates for Jordan exactly how big a liar Posobiec is, based on a past appearance of his on InfoWars regarding Pizzagate. That sentence would have been nonsense five years ago.
