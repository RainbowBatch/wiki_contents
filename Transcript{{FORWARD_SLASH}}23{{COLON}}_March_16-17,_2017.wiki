But oftentimes, but you can leave a penny. If a penny we don't have a pennies anymore. So if you have something that's like 2.49 cents, and you double it, that's rounded to two cents, when you're adding it up. So it's two cents plus two cents. And what you'll end up with is 2.49 plus 2.492 equals 4.98. You round that up to five, you now have a nickel. So it's two cents plus two cents equals five cents. That's 11 in math. So

You know, he's not getting the economy going always there lies or whatever. He didn't release his tax returns. While we're busy dealing with that, and our sell out globalist leftist that have sold us out to Congress, China, you're gonna defeat this country. Trump could get the call today, tomorrow next month, whenever she skipped his break is too important.

And it'll be about 15 minutes till secondary hydrogen bombs get dropped on them. And they're going to hit the entire line. between South and North Korea where they've got those 100,000 artillery pieces and where they've got their troops. The word has North Korea's only got about 10 nukes. And so the entire front of North Korea is going to probably get hit with depending on the size of the bombs or nuclear weapons they use. It could be hundreds of nuclear weapons will be used small nuclear weapons to wipe out the tunnels the basis for neutralize it and then have troops pour across, they're gonna hit them with larger weapons. That's how it escalates. And then they'll start dropping the 500 megaton bombs on it'll show the whole country. And so right now there's over 1000 nuclear weapons just on a group of ships pointed at North Korea. Of course, you know, where the rest are really pointed. Right now, most of the missiles aren't aimed at Russia. They've been swung around for years to China, the chimey. Right at China, right? You name it. And I'm not saying any secrets here.
