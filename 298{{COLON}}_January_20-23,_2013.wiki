Today, Dan and Jordan stick in the past to gather a little more information about how Alex Jones did business in the days after Sandy Hook. In this installment, the gents see hints of Alex being overeager to cover shootings irresponsibly. They also discuss how off-base Alex is about the Aurora theater shooting, and find Alex becoming friends with a guest who may or may not be running a child trafficking ring.
