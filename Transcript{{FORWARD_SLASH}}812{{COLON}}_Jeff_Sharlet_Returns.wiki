    | text      = My bright spot today my bright spot today is? Well, you know. Okay, all right, I got one. I teach writing that day job. I teach writing at Dartmouth College. And I'm coming to you directly from a meeting with a student. And I gotta tell you, it is thrilling to me not just as a teacher, but as a person. And these frightening times when you see a student, it's nonfiction, I teach the same kind of writing that I try to do when you see a student writing about the connections and the connections suddenly starting to make Mrs. A person trying to write about sex trafficking in our region where we are right and talking about the stories that we tell ourselves in order to live like that famous Joan Didion line and the scary narratives and the Christian nationalists who come in with stories about that, too, and putting all this together. And that's a lot of ugliness for a bright spot, right. But when you see a young person put discovering that they have the power to put these things together, to juxtapose them on the page, and to make a story that brings clarity to someone else. And that this is what they want to do. And they're gonna keep going with this. You're like, Ah, thank God, right? It's always thrilling when you encounter someone else, learning to tell stories, because it's so cheesy, but you feel less alone, right? Like, because my story alone is not going to do it. But we have this great cacophony choir and good come into the choir. And when you see someone coming into the choir and joining the sort of storytelling world, you have some faith that, you know what if I miss it, if I screw it up? That's alright. Someone else would get it right.

And so I'm looking forward to it because Alex describes many, many people as Renfield. You know, they're the big vampires who the globalist vampires who drink all the blood and then they're all the red fields of whom can can be different every single day. Some people were a Renfield two years ago, and now they're the king. You know, it's it's random.

Because the people I'm talking to are basing their reality on movies. And they're not weird. I to draw on this, right? Like we draw on for the stories with these stories, we have a way of telling things. We're always looking for these metaphors. It is the primary granary of metaphor from which we draw. So you know, but but draw carefully, I guess I would say the Renfield thing like don't write.

    | text      = Well, that is actually where I wanted to start. You know, we went through a lot of the content of the book on our last interview. So I think the one thing that I really want to start with is, well, I mean, kind of what we were just talking about Ashley Babbitt as, as martyr. I, when I read the book, I feel a certain ambivalence about Ashley Babbitt as martyr because, to a certain extent, their their martyrdom of her is completely fictional, right. But there is also a very real martyrdom that she went through. So I'd like you to kind of talk about your feelings on that.

    | name      = Jeff Sharlet
    | timestamp = 00:06:10.000
    | text      = Well, I mean, this is the thing that I that I get pushed back on a lot like Ashley Babbitt is not a martyr, but we don't get to choose the martyrs of other movements. Right. You know, if you're a Roman there are a couple 1000 years ago, don't tell me about the Christian martyrs and our martyrs the rascals we got a good thing going here we got sewage we got everything is great. There's some voting it's not perfect. It's not the diamond ideal democracy, but we're getting there and then look at these assholes and they're talking about someone raising, rising from the dead now that's absolutely ridiculous. That's not a martyr. That's, that's, that's that's delusional, right? Martyr of course, in you know, this means witness. And Ashley Babbitt did die a witness to her cause she's a martyr. I mean, he's a martyr by any definition, that her cause is false and fake, makes it no less true. And if we want to do that, then we basically get rid of the word martyr altogether. The problem is when we assume that martyr is a good thing, right? Sure. A martyr is a politically agnostic term. It is what you make of it. And what I was fascinated by Ashley Wait, you know, when you say that completely sort of fictional martyrdom, and I'm like, What's the nonfiction?

    | text      = She was by the cops, you know, to a certain extent that oh, yeah, right. Right. Oh, she you know, your book is covered with her weapon, a knife. And she was shot. Yeah. So I don't see. I don't see too much. You know, there is a difference between people who were shot by the cops, for sure. There is a difference in murder, but they were still murdered by the cops. So I do think that there's something to be said about that. Yeah.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jeff Sharlet
    | timestamp = 00:08:00.000
    | text      = And I think I think that's actually really, that's actually the key point, right for understanding what's to me is the key point to understand what's going on in the Trump scene. So I think last time we talked about like, like, there's the prosperity gospel of 2016. Then the bastardized Gnostic gospel of 24. American fundamentalists, yeah, yeah. And then in January 20, January 6 2021, we enter this age of martyrs and Ashley becomes the first martyr. And she's an ideal martyr for that movement, partly because she's a white woman and a veteran. So she's gendered. Both right. The veteran is stabbed in the back a male, but she's a white woman who they instantly start aging backwards.

    | text      = If you accuse her yes, right, right. And they that she's not 35. She's in her 20s. She's 16. She's just a little white girl. And the man who shoots her is an ever larger black cop, right? And so this is the old lynching story, the old white, innocent white woman. And this goes all the way back to Virginia Dare the first white girl born in North America who gives her name V dare to anally prominent right wing sites. So there's that element of martyrdom. And I think the fiction versus nonfiction because what's fascinating to me, that opens the door for martyrdom, and I think of her as essentially a placeholder on the cross until Trump could, you know, push her aside and take his place, which is what you know, once these indictments started coming down, he starts sending out emails, friends, this may be the last time I talked to you for some time, right until the email I'm going to send you in right half hour.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jeff Sharlet
    | timestamp = 00:09:35.000
    | text      = Yeah, yeah. But the martyrdom gets extended right and so she opens the door to the fundamental narrative of white, white power that that grievance so now you can be a martyr if you get shot by the cops. You can be a martyr if you get indicted for illegal payoffs to your mistress. You can be a martyr if you're the janitor. already six choir singing your song. Everybody is now an age of martyrs. This is the theological frame. You know, I wore my Trump hat to work, and I noticed my co workers given me sign I, I had been persecuted for my faith. I'm like Ashley Babbitt. I too am a martyr. So right in that fictional sense, Ashley Babbitt actually was killed. And historically, that's what a martyr means. But now, moderate means anyone who suffers for the cause, which, in Trumpism, in the Trumpist imagination, is anyone who believes in the cause to believe in the cause is to suffer for the cause is to have a Soros backed da, or maybe, you know, a Soros backed coach on your son's baseball team who's not putting him in, you know, what's, what's that about? Right? being martyred for our believes that that coach is a liberal?

    | text      = Well, I mean, let me ask you to follow up on that is, you know, I think it's, it's suddenly far less impressive to become a martyr if everybody else you know, is also a martyr. Do you know what I mean? So is that not lessening the power of your Ashley Babbitt, who was actually, you know, if everybody's taking some sort of Stolen Valor of martyrdom from her death, doesn't that make her death far less meaningful?

    | text      = I think in normal times, yes. And I think we've been through enough, you know, the folks I would talk to talk about this there was some who would see her as the the first death of this new American Revolution. She is our Crispus Attucks killed in 1776. Of course, Crispus Attucks is a black Wampanoag man killed I think in 1771. But you know, don't get caught up on those details. Yeah. And then there's others who would sort of see her as another entry in an calendar sort of already crowded with martyrs Vicki Weaver from the Ruby Ridge standoff where knowledge by listeners probably know what that is, I bet Oh, you better believe talking about it? Yeah.

    | text      = We know about. It's so nice to talk to folks who are to whom I don't have to explain conspiracy theories. Or Waco, obviously, and of course, everyone knows that waco now, because Trump put it back into the national consciousness. And, you know, there's other folks that they and what's interesting to me it's actually traveling around is there are regional variations of this, you'll find like somebody who was killed by cops in a standoff, maybe because they didn't pay their taxes or something. And there was a foreclosure and so on. This doesn't become national news. But in this region, you got Crispus Attucks, you got Ashley Bab, you got Vicki Weaver and Joe X, who who's our local Mark murderer, right. And normally, Joe X goes away of Vicki Weaver, which is to say, and Vicki Weaver, you could argue pretty legitimate martyr.

    | text      = I mean, that is kind of where we where we get into the ambivalence part, right? Is they not have been killed, they create a fictionalized version of a real martyr. And I think almost part of that is to avoid from actually having to deal with the real reason that the martyr was created. All right, well, let

But But let me just sort of say about that. I mean, there's a section in this book that I think and I'm so glad that people aren't attacking me for it, but I thought they would want I thought, you know, people would say you're humanizing Ashley Babbitt. I can't, she's human. i You can't humanize anybody. She is human. And, and so am I. And so I want to understand how she comes to this place, not as some kind of common ground bullshit, but because because look, that's her knife on the cover, and she was there in the Capitol. Sure. But then there's the killing. And I have done a lot of reporting on police killings. And, and they have helped bring some today and have learned a lot about where that wall is why that was fucked up. You know, with Kyle Rittenhouse people say travesty that he was acquitted. It's not a travesty that he was acquitted. It's a travesty that the law was written in such that he there was nothing to do but acquit him. Right? He was within

She was breaking into the Capitol. And this drives me nuts. because No, that was not probably, we'll never know because it was no real investigation. That was probably not a legitimate killing. I talked to a man named Seth stone literally wrote the book on police use of force, former cop became a law scholar was an you know, former cop. Well, of course, he's on their side. He was the expert witness and the conviction of Derek Chauvin. He was the guy who said, let me explain to you in every little nuanced way, why this was not legitimate use of force, right? And that's usually the side he is on. He is usually testifying as an expert witness in trials against cops saying no, they crossed, they crossed the line. He looked at video and he says, Look, this isn't a court. We can't do this. But yeah, this does not look legitimate and people say, but she was breaking into the Capitol. Do we want to live in a world where cops can shoot to kill anybody who breaks into a house? No bait stand your ground does not apply to cops, and it shouldn't in fact, cops, cops legally, if there's a backdoor someone breaks in the front door, and there's a backdoor rather than killing you. They're supposed to go out the back door. Sure. And they have to evaluate on three criteria, right? Is this can you remember them all? Ashley Babbitt does not meet all three. Right? She has, we don't know she might have a weapon. The weapons not visible. Sure. But she's not in a place because she cannot get over this barrier. He had other means of stopping her before she got to that right. So he shoots. Now, here's the complicated part.

    | text      = And by Yeah, and by the shot her as her family's lawyer who is a police violence lawyer. He's not some bright wing fascist lawyer. He's a lawyer who represents people who've been brutalized by police. Right. So this is not to say, look, Ashley Babbitt is. I said, I said, Stoughton. I said, Are you saying she's not a domestic terrorist? And he says, No, she's, yeah, she's a domestic terrorist. And and so people say, don't we get to shoot domestic terrorists? No, no, we arrest them. we arrest them and try them. And if there's nothing else, and it's the last incident, and someone is about to be harmed, then we at currently, under a law say the police have the right to use violent force, this guy would have been indicted, if it had happened anywhere, but in the capital, which is this very weird gray area of law. And it's almost sort of like this gray area where criminal law doesn't quite apply. Right. So he was found not not guilty. He was just found like, we can't be sure that he wasn't afraid for his life. Sure. And so can't be sure that he had malice based on a civil rights violation. If you had passed the George Floyd, police reform law, that guy would have been indicted. Right. So the Republicans have said, How come there's not justice for Ashley? Because they rigged the laws so that there can't be right and make the laws to protect the police. I mean, this is sort of a long, wonky detour. But I think when you talk about the real, like, just the way you said it like that, they they trademark it to martyrs, because they don't want to talk about the real ones. Yes,

Well, I mean, that is that is kind of it and it is, it is something that I think is quite funny to me, just the way that we think about things is that assumption, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with invading the Capitol. It's our fucking building. Like that's, that's a point of view that we keep avoiding is like, it is not inherently a bad thing. It's not, you know, I

Yeah. The same logic that leads some liberals to say I wish they had just opened fire on Ashley Babin. All of them is the same logic by which oh that to what who is saying that oh my god daughter out there this is so I tell you what if go back and look in that early like say Washington Post coverage of Ashley Babbitt and read the comments, you want some blood read the comments and now here's the interesting thing. And then and then you see like the ad for a while there was the sort of fake accounts mocking Ashley Babbitt and and they would always say, and I'm going to quote, I'm going to quote here some variation some paraphrase of I'm glad they shot the bitch. And the pitch is not accidental. The misogynistic language Sure, yeah, sure. It would, it would come into this right. This was sort of giving some liberals license to, to feel that anger and and Hey, and look, it's a witch site. Look, I'm not going to argue this is not a main argument. My book like Ashley Babbage shouldn't have been shot. I don't think she should have been. But I do think she should have been arrested. And I think they should have, you know, I'm not an abolitionist of the justice system, I think she should have been arrested in put in jail. And same with the J Sixers. And if she had gotten over that barrier and pulled her knife and been about to stab that cop, then yeah, then I think it would have been a legitimate shooting, but that's not where it was. Right. But I think that I'll stop there because

And then he's talking about liberals in the lake. And he's saying they're lucky I'm not on the other side. Now, your your response to that is when you boil it down, is that America is going to have to experience and go through fascism. Yeah, you didn't, you didn't say like, maybe you didn't say it's possible or the future or etc, you are saying definitively that is going to happen?

I can't stand the way you know, I'm a lefty, but you know, every fucking president you dislike is fascist. On the one hand, yes. There's always been fascism in America. And as I write in the book, you know, I mean, you go, I say, I say it's, fascism is multiculturalism. Now, its gravitational pull with with which is able to pull in people of color into a white supremacist movement. That's his latest contribution to fascism. The earliest contribution, you know, you had the Nazis, studying Jim Crow laws. And then this is actually true, Nazi jurists saying, looking at Jim Crow laws and one drop of blood and saying, that's a little too much. We can't go that far. Right. It seems extreme to them.

And I think a lot of liberals are doing this thing of saying, Yeah, but America is not like Nazi Germany. No, it's not because there was not just in power, but consolidated in power, and that we may not go through. But we're going through the fascism right now, in the sense that I think of, you know, queer and trans folks being criminalized in 20 states, right? You have people moving for basic health care you have, you have all these casualties of this slow civil war.

So if you say to me, we're going through fascism, we're in this place where we don't have a fascist regime yet.

And so he was always looking at in ways that some of which seems obvious to us. Now, fascism is mobilization of the mythological and so on, and some of it, and when I read this book, it's astonishing to me, because partly, it's also granular detail. He's talking about, like what's happening in one smaller German city, because these are essays that are written in the moment. Before Nazi before the regime is fully in power. You see so many resonances, and you realize, I mean, it's from reading that book that I realized, like, oh, the Trump rallies certainly never ended. And and how did I miss this? I remember in 2016, I wrote a little essay trying to encourage my lefty friends all right, Greg, let's let's vote for Hillary. And the problem isn't just Trump, it's the million little Trump's that are going to be unleashed. Well, now we have Trump around. We just had one in New Hampshire. But you want to go to Trump rally, no problem, go to your school board meeting. Go to many city hall meetings, you've got a million little Trump's not all the same charisma, but the same rhetoric. The Montana State legislator, that's a Trump rally, the Tennessee State Legislature, that's a Trump rally. And when I say it's a rally, it means that they're no longer interested in, you know, even the veneer of governing. It's the performative rejection of the other, the black legislators in Tennessee, the trans that just in Montana, and I think there's another one in Iowa has been silenced. I think a mother of a trans person, I think it's an Iowa has been silenced. Right. And I want to say also, like we hear about those national stories, there's more, there's always more every journalist knows this, right? The stories that make it somehow catch the National Eye.

And I think of this sort of turning point, I think and of course, she's not alive. So we can't know. But it comes up in some of her, her writing and videos. And so on this point, she lives in Southern California, very blue, Southern California. She's gone in for Trump. No one's really followed her. Her husband and a girlfriend because she's both they, they are a throttle. They're kind of a queer throttle. There's videos they make of Ashley watching Trump rallies, they just think it's her weird thing, right? Or, like, go to the beach, Ashley. And, you know, we don't really follow that. But there's a point a house lessness is a huge problem in Southern California. And, and it's growing, right? And that has all kinds of structural issues, right? And actually tries to remember that and tries to be compassionate. And in one day, a guy shits on her lawn, and she just gives up, goes leans back into the undertone. You know, I'm not paddling, I'm not trying to be the better person. I'm not trying to see the larger problem. I just want to fucking hate this dude who shot in my lawn, and Trump comes along, and he tells me it's okay. And not only I'm not a bad person, for hating that. I'm a good person. I'm a victim.

And like so many people in the Trump world, I think the right, I mean, you can talk to folks in Trump world, and they sound like they just come from a screening of democracy now. Right. They will talk about blood for oil and and and and what they lost in the Iraq War and how bitter they are and how that war was for Halliburton. That diagnosis is fairly accurate.

And it's always been there, right? Is this race or is this class or is this misogyny? Yes, yes, yes. That's called intersectionality. And it's a million other little things. It is the disappointments of life. It's it's a marriage that didn't work. It's it's the shame she feels a lot. So many people made this. A lot of the fact that she think in 2016. The man she ended up marrying Aaron Babbitt. It was a complicated transition. Who knows if there was some cheating or whatever involved and Ashley Babbitt loses her temper. And allegedly, although is found not guilty later, rams the other woman's car. That's fucking horrible. What a fucking horrible thing to do. This is, this is also she's not proud of that. People like look at that. That's the way that person is. Well, we on the left on the liberation side, we are the ones who are supposed to own the idea that you are not defined by your worst act, right? This is why we oppose the carceral state, which is why we oppose essentialism, the American caste, right. And yet she is and and, and I think why does she choose Trump? You're right, there's an absence. There's an absence. It's there on the left, but you have to go looking, it's not as visible, Trump is more more visible. I think about this in a previous book of minds we hadn't when a guy wrote about a movement called Battle Cry, and what battlecry would do in the early 2000s, as they would have these like three day rock festivals for evangelical teens, 70,000 folks. And they would go out there and I remember there was one stick, they would have, they would have a candle hide. And they would talk about and they'd be projecting on the screen and said you know what corporations are doing to you. They're branding you and they will brand the height. And they will put up on the screen, Oakley or Coca Cola. They're brand new, they're brand new, the branding you write is could be Adbusters. This is this is a leftist critique. And yet, then they swooped them up, and battlecry you can hear it in the name. Some of the the other stage, the one thing they did is they bring a mannequin on and each part of the mannequin would be labeled like pornography or some other things that they did. And then they would take this biblical story about a concubine, who was given by a figure to the mob to be torn up in that this is somehow the good,

But one who had also many more temptations, and most of us as a superstar, easy for him to walk away. He stayed fully 100%. In the struggle, he stayed in the anger for 96 years. That's the long struggle, right? That's the struggle against fascism. That's a struggle for the democracy. We have not yet enjoyed an acceleration as to say it's time to give up. Democracy doesn't do enough. what fools we haven't had it yet. Right? Wouldn't it be something that's why there's a chapter in the book about Occupy to the pleasures of physical democracy as one person describes it of like the democracy of we're going to sleep together, and the park, we're going to cook together, we're going to make a library together, we're going to have really clunky, boring, slow consensus meetings and consensus meetings are fucking boring.

And Waukesha is one of the counties that used to be the most right wing counties in America. It is the purest white flight.

And in walk us and now there's a I mean, the school board, school board, we have school board people, they're saying we should just not teach science. Science is of the devil. I mean, it's really Oh, yeah, I think they, I think was a school board. There was a little scandal recently there was a Somewhere over the rainbow that we can't sing that is gay.

And this looms so large on the right, they say you'd want to talk about Karl Rittenhouse. Let's talk about math boy fly math boy fly who is essentially an asshole, right. But he's an asshole of his times. And sometimes he talks online about Black Lives Matter and so on. So they conclude that he is doing this for black lives matter. In fact, this man lacks any ideological principle. He is domestic violence guy and is fleeing from the cops and he just like he is the absolute narcissism. People my way I'm driving through them and he kills them. Right? Walker says also, and I think even maybe more important, where in 2014 we have the Slenderman attempted murder and this is a sort of looming story to this great by the way people want to go and look for Alex Martin, in a magazine called V QR writes a piece called out came the girls. And it's it's so relevant actually to understanding the martyrdom cults and innocence of girlhood alleged innocence of girlhood to 12 year old girls were their third friend into the woods to kill her for Slenderman who they have read about online. I mean, this is I mean, this is Alex Jones territory, right. And it's swirling around its world And around both like the conspiracy myth of Slenderman. And then the conspiracy myth of sort of liberal anxiety, which is that the internet is in fact, Slender Man The boogey man that's going to take our kids, and it will happen sometimes.

His online life rippled with right wing hatreds, but He dedicated the panicked days before his crime, to a sped up aesthetic of images and ideologies, crashing into one another sometimes called schizo wave is a vile term, a grotesque romanticization of mental illness, an awful metaphor for the quickening of our fragmentation, the great acceleration, a simultaneous explosion and collapse of meaning, right? And so like schizo wave, and it's very simple verb form schizoid posting. accelerationism is a relatively recent term allegedly coined, or at least brought into contemporary use in 2013 by two Marxist political scientists via the influence of a two volume work of 1970s French theory called capitalism and schizophrenia, and this wonky audience might even know Deleuze and Guattari write what crisis gathers force and speed politics, withers and retreats the political scientists hashtag accelerate. medica Festo for an acceleration is brought to politics announced and the overwhelming, overwhelming privileging of the democracy as process needs to be left behind. It was a rejection of the slow small work of solidarity in favor of a, quote, future more modern. Yes, said the fascist intellectuals adapting the concept to their own ends. Yes.

Peekskill, New York, Paul Robeson is the headliner, the so called Russia loving Negro baritone. As the local newspaper puts it, they tried to have it the concert twice. First time the townspeople shut it down because they think these are communists, unwanted. They think they're communists, because they're communists. But they don't want any communists. And they shut it down and they burn crosses. The second time. They come prepared 3000 union members come as security, they managed to sing the song Time to get the hell out.

Right, and they just wanted to live by themselves, but pretty soon, local women and sis women in need of help fleeing violent relationships come to them right. And so they decide which side are they on and they let them in right now. The men come after that too. Right. And this is a rural area that police they are not going to be coming out to help the lesbian commune right? I can't remember if Suzanna and her comrades armed up but they definitely stood their ground. They stood the ground and they protected those places. Now there was a young radical activist who says to Suzanne and Suzanne by this point is although as radical as can be has just, if you think sweet southern grandmother, you got the right picture. white haired, very gentle voice just just just really just lovely and gentle and so on. And this young radical activist says that's so amazing that you build a safe space in Suzanne says, Oh, honey, there are no fucking safe spaces. That wasn't a safe space. It was a safe moment. And it was made a safe space is in our it's there. A safe moment for a while it's possible not to be scared even that is the hope. That's the best that we have right now we can create these safe moments actively and hold on to them and remember them. And instead of saying that's just a goddamn failure, say, hey, wait a minute. Look at that. We haze? Have you created a moment where it was possible not to be scared, even. Probably you have this show has I tried to write we try to do that.

No, I didn't tell him. It's not the way when I go into Sacramento, and there's a brawl between proud boys and Antifa. And it's the dumbest Brawl I've ever seen, because they all know each other. And is like rules of engagement. They know where they can't have weapons on the Capitol and so on. You know, and look anti for being assholes to you know, Antifa is yelling faggot, and proud boys are yelling scum. And boom, boom, boom, right?

Well, they kill a young physicist, they had a plane that they were dropping bombs from. I'm not big about dropping bombs from planes. Even if you believe in violence, that's just not for me. They were fools. The ones who blew up the the building in me there's a lot of killing, on the other hand, has a lot of killing. I'm written elsewhere about the Vietnam gi movement. I'm named Jeff Charlotte, because my uncle was one of the founders of that movement. And it was a mutiny movement, by GE eyes. And they weren't mutiny against their commanders, and they sometimes killed commanders. This is what we call treason. And I'm not gonna say it was wrong. No, it's totally right. The American I'm not gonna say that was wrong. A World War Two, I'm definitely not going to say that was wrong.

I am both siding, both sides in this. The American exceptionalism of believing that this is somehow a uniquely American thing, as if there is not a Trump of Turkey named Erawan. Sure, Trump, Brazil name balsa narrow, and Myanmar, a self described trunk of Myanmar a Buddhist monk who leaves a genocidal mobs of Buddhist monks to massacre the Rohingya Muslims, as if there are not the Philippines as if there is not Indonesia, which has been fascist since the Americans supported coup in the 1960s. which to this day celebrates, celebrates, is genocide. Fascism is a global moment. And what is different now than in the past, is in the 1930s, you had contending powers. Right now. What have you got? China is a fascist regime. The fact is state, communism, whatever. It's yeah, I got it around. GE, it wasn't always but it has become one Russia. Russia is and we can quibble over details, but Russia is. And I would say they are fascist regimes of the moment, right. So people say this is how it is different than Germany, right? Because it's called Russia and it's 2023. Not 1956. That's why you're right. It is different. Fascism, like everything else evolves. And so we have all that we have European countries sort of toppling. We have the great victory of Lula and Brazil but let's see how long that lasts. We have a lot of fascist regimes in Africa right now Uganda as a fascist regime. Sudan is telling me the Sudan is gonna come out looking pretty from this one came out of a fascist regime and it struggled the long struggle. So do young student needs people's Holy shit. We overthrew Omar. What's his name? Omar Bashir. We overthrow this this guy, we did it, we did it. And we even muted the military and got them to be on our side. And then just a few years later, look at this, well, can't join him. Can't beat him might as well join him. I guess I might as well just go for authoritarian rule. That's Chris Noonan's deciding which side is ya know, we lost the good fight is the one you lose the good fight that the Sudanese who overthrew that dictator. They fought the good fight the Egyptians, who overthrew Mubarak and now suffer under sec, they fought the good fight. The Arab Spring was the good fight. Right. So there's all these kinds of struggles. And I think that the state versus this is where Fascism is different now, because there are no contending powers. Right. There's no Soviet Union. And there's no with this. There's there's an America or America that no, we're not fully given in. We are not as given in as Russia or Hungary. We are still contending. And one of the mistakes that the left has made, I'm writing from the right for a long time, the left is terrible at recognizing the ground that it occupies. Right the ground that it owns. And I think about this for so many years, liberals would say the universities were neutral. No, they're not biased, and leftists would say no bullshit. They're just right wing tools. Right. And the right wingers I write about the guys who founded Liberty University in Regent University and Oral Roberts University in Hillsdale College, which is now giving his curriculum to public schools all over the country. They understood that these crappy elitist universities, nonetheless, they were part of the center that was holding, it wasn't a very good center, but they were part of that leftist and I have colleagues now who think that fighting our administration at Dartmouth, where, you know, the the full spectrum of a political views is kind of like, Are you a Bernie Democrat? Or maybe more of a like establishment Democrat? Right. That's what that's what you get. And that's fine. That's fine. I'm not like there should be intellectual diversity, whatever you think. Right. But they think that fighting that administration puts them on the front lines, the bulwark of the battle, right? No, that's not the battle. Right? That's is, this is Dartmouth College, super problematic institution, students who struggle for it, and so on. But the frontline right now is in teachers in New Hampshire, afraid for their jobs, in some cases, afraid for their lives, just because they're teaching the history of slavery. And some people gonna say, Well, if we can address these other issues, when right when the line is now anyone who's asking that, as someone who's never had a gun pointed at them, right? Sure. When you have a gun pointed at you, you don't say, well, there's some structural in Omaha, Nebraska and this book, right. And they bring out the gunman. I didn't want to say, well, let's talk about the ways in which your church, you know, you're pointing a gun at me. Right? I got to do something about that. Right. And so I think that state violence, like I am not as opposed to the state right now. And I think we need to look at this right now. Because this who owns the state capitalism, but capitalism leads to fascism, but it is not the same thing. Biden is not the same as the Santas. And if we come to the real fear that I think is there, and that you're seeing generals, say, and, you know, not all generals, but Right, the military is not monolithic. If we come to a real chain of command dispute in 2024, the fear is not the militias. And the the resistance is not the John Brown Gun Club. It's an Air Force base in one state that believes that Trump is president and an Air Force Base and another state that believes that Biden is president and follows the
