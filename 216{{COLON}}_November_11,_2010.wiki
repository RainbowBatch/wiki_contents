Today, Dan and Jordan discuss the Nov. 11, 2010 episode of The Alex Jones Show. On the nights of Nov. 9-10, 2010, Glenn Beck aired a deeply antisemitic two-part "expose" about how George Soros is the "puppet master" pulling the strings of the secret government machine. The gents got to thinking that maybe Alex's response to those broadcasts might tell them a little something. It turns out, it just might speak volumes.
