Got a lot of powerful news and information for you today. from around the world, and right here in the United States, and we'll be going over that starting after the first break. In the meantime, I want to just make one more comment about the whole Arnold Schwarzenegger situation. I spent a lot of time on this yesterday. And since then, I've done even more research I've been forced to talk about it. Force because it is the top story. It is dwarfing Kobe Bryant the other diversion it is distracting from all the real scams, the lies about weapons of mass destruction, the globalist preparing to launch more terror attacks. It's smoke screening, what's happening with the economy. And the reason that I'm so angry about this Arnold Schwarzenegger story is the guy admits that he's anti God. Anti family. Uh, he's fun. on abortion on demand he is for homosexuals adopting children. In his own book evolution of a bodybuilder, he says he doesn't like Christians.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 10:09
    | text      = So you see there, first of all this presentation that he's forced to talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger is ridiculous. Yeah. But on his list of complaints, a lot of that stuff sounds exactly like what you would hear nowadays, he's for abortion. He is anti gun. But the focus is on homosexuals at this point, because it's 2003. Yep. And this is where it is appropriate for Alex to attack. Yep, he viewed the gay community as vulnerable enough for him to bully at this point. Yeah. Which changed?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 10:46
    | text      = Yeah. You know, I feel like a lot of us after so much time, you know, past this, we all kind of thought, well, I guess our parents and, and religions and all kind of like, moved past the whole gay thing. You know, they they were like, Well, we think a lot of people did marriage, marriage is happening. And yet, nobody's being murdered by God all day, every day. So we're probably good. And now we live in a moment where we realized that those two throughout 2000 2003 thoughts just got quieter. Yeah, they didn't. They didn't go away.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 11:21
    | text      = No, no, it was people realized that they couldn't express these things in public anymore. The opinions did not change. No, none whatsoever. In fairness, maybe there is some subsection that of folks some some population that did evolve in their thinking, sure. And realize like, oh, maybe I don't need to hold on to this. Right. But there it wasn't the massive sea change necessarily, that it appeared to be based on it was Yeah, yeah. And that complacency I think is maybe screwed as well. And will become a problem. Yeah. So I was thinking about like, what is going on here with this this Arnold stuff because it's so it's incessant. And I realized on this episode that Alex was very much talking about Arnold specifically in the context of Mel Gibson. And I kind of came to realize that it was because Mel Gibson is getting heat for Passion of the Christ right and anti semitic portrayals in it and his family's anti semitic he is right. And so Alex is trying to attack Arnold to do cover for our Gibson.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 12:42
    | text      = Why am I spending so much time on this because the Simon Wiesenthal Center says Arnold is a model person the best you can be a friend to Jewish This is amazing folks. And then you see Time magazine and it says that Arnold it compares him to Ronald Reagan and it says that Arnold you know was his dad was a police chief and Ronald Reagan's dad was a shoe salesman, just getting out of control. And all of this simultaneously. While there is a massive news Blitz, attacking friends of this show, the Gibson family good American huntin Gibson World War Two, they took his family to Australia and 68 came back to this country.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 13:33
    | text      = So a lot of this surrounds essentially the Simon Wiesenthal Center, having criticisms of Mel Gibson's film, right and the Gibson family simultaneously endorsing Arnold that's basically where all this is rooted. Yeah. And it's it's pretty clear the game Alex is playing and the reason he asked to cover this article CIT, even though he insists he doesn't want to is just this. He loves melon hut and Gibson and the two of them are very clear anti Semites, Mel's new film, The Passion of the Christ is getting flack for being anti semitic in tone. Simultaneously, Arnold is running for Governor of California and he said some stuff about Hitler in the mid 70s. That's been taken out of context and his dad was an essay officer and occupied Austria. So this is the way that Alex is going to take some heat off off of his actual righties medic friend. Right, right, right. Obviously, it's not good for your dad to be a Nazi. But that doesn't make you a Nazi.

On the flip side Malin, hunt and Gibson have personally engaged in explicit anti semitic acts including Holocaust denial and revisionism. Alex knows this if Mel decided to speak out against Trump in early 2016 outs would have mysteriously become aware of all this shit and used it to attack it. Oh, here we are in 2003 and Alex's smearing Arnold just because he needs to carry water for his father and son bigot act that apparently will talk to him Yeah, it's so clear that Arnold is only interesting to Alex in as much as like he can use it to deflect from right

And then the very same head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center is praising Arnold who Arnold said in pumping iron that he his his, his idol was Adolf Hitler. He he quote, saw him as a role model and supports Kurt Waldheim. I mean, it just shows the the hypocrisy of all this.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 17:06
    | text      = is all good fun. And it's furthering of the theme of the day which seems to be that Alex is mad that people are calling Mel Gibson anti semitic but not Arnold. Yeah, Arnold is a mainstream Republican so Alex wants to smear him whereas Gibson is a zealot extremist whose father is apparently friends with Alex so Alex loves him and won't stand for accurate accusations of him being a bigot. Right. I wanted to play this clip because it shows a very intentional misdirection by Joyce and Alex. They say that the Simon Wiesenthal Center found that Arnold's father was a Nazi and that is true, but they're purposefully admit omitting some information that their audience would benefit from having. The first thing is that Arnold requested they investigate his father's background. He was not in any way trying to hide from the past or the reality of his father's bad deeds. The second thing is that the center wasn't necessarily setting out to determine if his dad was involved in the Nazi party. That was all pretty much understood and definitively known.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 18:24
    | text      = I'm guessing it also was like how much exactly? That's what I'm saying. Yeah. The result of the investigation was that there's no such record. The consensus seems to be that there's no affirmative evidence of him committing war crimes, but war records are also imperfect. So it can't be fully ruled out either. Whatever the case, the sins of the father are not necessarily appropriate to take out on the son and it's dumb to make what his dad did or didn't do in World War Two Arnold's fault. Joyce and Alex say that the investigation found that his dad was a Nazi, but they don't include the other details because that would hurt their point. This is an intentional choice. Yeah, this stuff about him admiring Hitler is taken out of context. And Arnold has successfully sued people for making these kinds of claims in the past. That stuff about Kurt Waldheim is fair enough. But what Alex is referring to is a toast that Arnold gave it his wedding in 1986. At that point, there's no reason to think that Arnold would have known about Walt of all times lies about his actions in World War Two since reporting about that didn't start until that year, and accusations of his involvement in war crimes didn't happen until 1987. Right. There's a lot of shade Enos that is fair to say. But what Alex is doing is a shameful mischaracterization of a person and he's doing it specifically to distract from his clearly anti semitic friend.

Yeah. So I poked around and found out that this was the case of 61 year old Maryland man Bill Lovell Wheeler. As it turns out in this state, it's illegal to have more than five pounds of smokeless gunpowder and also illegal to store it in anything other than its original container because it's incredibly unsafe for sure. Yeah. And the rationale for one of the reasons why it is particularly unsafe is a sure you could blow up your house but also it could affect your neighbor's right. It's not just you totally Wheeler was storing this shit in a new container and he had 62 pounds of it so little bit over the limit. That is what when the cops showed up, he quotes candid officers literature from the National Alliance, neo Nazi group based in West Virginia and told them a race war was coming right. Wheeler claimed that he wasn't a Nazi or anything but that his wife was a member of the National ally. It's at hosted a radio show called quote grandmother Elizabeth's reading our for white children.

So I will say that we had kind of planned where the idea was that we do an episode on Monday, about a video that had been posted on band dot video. It was a fourth hour of Alex's show hosted by a guy named Royce White, who is a failed GOP candidate to unseat Ilhan Omar in Minnesota. And he has taken to defending Kanye in a way that is maybe a bad way to defend him. He's doubling down on some of the things God knew saying and labeling Jews who he doesn't like anti Jews. Yeah. And it's very, it's very troubling. The trend that you're seeing in the right wing right now. Yeah, in particularly the way anti semitism is so on the rise and emboldened by statements that Kanye is making. You see Nick Fuentes coming out. And really, really going hard. Thanks to some of the cover, I guess you get from Kanye, and his behaviors. And you see it on Infowars. You see, you see the certain section of the content, being kind of denial of like, this isn't anti semitic? What are you talking about? Right? What did he say? Right, you know, and then you have another section of it. That is like, no, actually, he's right. And it's not all Jews. It's just bad Jews, hey, or whatever. Yeah. And you go back to 2003. And you're kind of hoping for a different tone. And then No, have a caller who's bringing up the international Jew? And I think I think the lesson that you take away from this or that I think is appropriate to take away from this is like, this is what this show is Yeah, yeah.

He said the call, quote, didn't come in any alarming fashion, which is why I'm hesitant to make an alarming statement. It wasn't an abnormal call. I'm always concerned if my flight is going to be on time, and they always alert me if I ought to be careful. And guess what? He was still going to fly that day. He didn't change his plans. He only didn't fly because it was an 8am flight out of San Francisco, which is after the Trade Center had already been hit. He was going like he was gonna go to the airport. He's waiting for his ride when he saw the news of the attack on TV. Yeah, I was just making shit up because he's a liar likes to fuck with his audience. Also, fun fact, the claim that the warning to Brown came from Condoleezza Rice traces back to a comment made by a Holocaust denier, David Irving, who had no proof for the claim, and he's just making that shit up to kind of weird how there's so much Nazi shit on this show.

What was it? It clearly wasn't that severe, because he was gonna fly anyway. Right? Also, if it was something that indicates it was indicative of foreknowledge of the attack. That's kind of dumb, because the flight was taken off after the attack happened. There is a rally, they knew that it was going to happen, they would know when it was going to happen, right? And he wouldn't have to be warned at all because his plane would never take off. Nope. So none of this makes any sense. Let's conspiracy built out of nothing.
