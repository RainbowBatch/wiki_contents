===[[Harrison Smith]] Version===

[[Elizabeth Williamson]] wrote a profile of Dan and Jordan entitled "[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/us/politics/alex-jones.html Alex Jones's Podcasting Hecklers Face Their Foil's Downward Slide]". This prompted Harrison Smith to do a whole segment clumsily attempting to make fun of both Dan and Jordan and the article, which DJ Danarchy immediately turned into a song, which was played as the intro for [[551: April 20-21, 2021]].

<blockquote>--ownwards slide,  Downwards-- Downwards-- Downwards slide, oh it's a downwards slide, is it?

Wheeeeeee----

A couple of greasy, overgrown man-children, they have a podcast called Knowledge Fight?

Alex Jones' podcasting hecklers; KnowledgeFight.com

They're doing research! You ever listen to the show? Knowledge Fight. Knowledge Fight.

Ugh, a couple of neck-beards, indeed. They literally just make stuff up.

They don't ever  talk about what Alex Jones actually talks about, they don't actually say what he actually says, they don't actually delve into his sources of information.

Wheeeeeeeee----- Mr. Friesen -- Mr. Freisen, I was live you numb-skulls.

They're in league with some sort of cult leader called Celine; Wheeeeee----

Knowledge Fight, mocking InfoWars, Every single day. It's really just incredible. It's almost hard to comprehend.

I love you.

Whe-Whe-Whe-Wheeee-----</blockquote>

===You Belong to the City Edit===

==== Lyrics====

<blockquote>

When you said goodbye you were on the run

Tryin' to get away from the things you've done

Now you're back again and you're feeling strange

So much has happened, but nothing has changed

Still don't know where you're going

You're still just a face in the crowd

You belong to the city

You belong to the night

Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light

You were born in the city

Concrete under your feet

It's in your blood, it's in your moves

For a man of the streets

You can feel it

You can taste it

You can see it

You can face it

You can hear it

Red alert, red alert, red alert

Yeah

Red alert, red alert, red alert

You're getting near it

Red alert, red alert, red alert

You wanna make it, ooh-ooh

Red alert, red alert, red alert

'Cause you can take it, ooh-ooh

Kn-kn-kn-Knowledge Fight

You belong to the city

Dan and Jordan

We are the bad guys.

===Episode 666 Version ===

Created and played as the intro for [[666: March 31, 2022|666]].

<blockquote>And the New World Order cannot kill me unless Celine decides it's time for me to die.

This is it -- Knowledge Fight -- the rise of Satan's kingdom on Earth.

For told of old -- Knowledge Fight -- the Old and New Testament. Prophesied for more than 5000 years.

Cult of Celine

=== [[Norm Pattis]] Version===

In the wake of ensuring that his client secured the biggest ever defamation judgement in US history, [[Norm Pattis]] went on his podcast to complain that it was actually "Alex Haters" like KnowledgeFight who were to blame for InfoWars years long contempt of court campaign.  DJ Danarchy remixed Norm's whining into a special intro for [[739: Formulaic Objections Part 8]].

==== Lyrics====

<blockquote>A young fireplug of a lawyer got his teeth into Alex Jones and decided that this was something he'd like to gnaw on, and uh, you know so he tore through a series of people who were designated as corporate reps and then published their -- depositions online, and so the haters -- had a field day, uh, with their corporate reps. no one else at InfoWars was willing to do it again.

No one wanted their-- their deposition placed on video online to the ridicule of all the Alex haters.

Knowledge Fight? There are people, there's a, there's a cult of Celine.

KnowledgeFight.com, there's something called Knowledge First or Knowledge Fight?

These people apparently live by loving to hate Alex Jones, and they pounce on every piece of video they can find.

KnowledgeFight.com There's uh, a website I learned about about called Knowledge Fight?

And, you know, these are a couple bottom feeders who make their chops hating Alex, and so they have Episodes almost daily.

You know that the corporate reps didn't want to be exposed to that again.

I guess I should say it. I got my ass kicked at KnowledgeFight.com</blockquote>

==== Lyrics====

<blockquote>

Okay.

I can't do the show, there's too many people in here

Go to rebroadcast! God dammit.

I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride

You know they say horses are psychic and that's been proven.

With sword and pistol by my side

Fuck the horse you rode in on

Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade

Probably 150 women or more, that's conservative.

Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade

Not that I've ever stomped anybody's guts out.

The bastards hung me in the spring of '25

Actually, I have a couple times. It's not too nice.

But I am still alive

How many people have you physically killed?

None.

I was a sailor

Deet-deet-deet-de-deet.

I was born upon the tide

Deet-bomp-deet-bomp-bomp Deet-bomp-bomp-deet-bomp

And with the sea I did abide

North Korean folks

I sailed a schooner 'round the horn to Mexico

Delivering ballots

I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow

through a harbor in Maine

And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed

She rented a boat and we went out on Lake Austin.

But I am living still

And I was like, God, what is it I'm supposed to do?

And it was like: Go after Glenn Beck.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide

God, those communists are amazing.

Where steel and water did collide

The democrats introduced bills to destroy half our dams

A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado

I'm about 97, 98 percent accurate.

I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below

We rarely have technical difficulties.

They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound

(mumbled) Life's very fragile.

But I am still around

I'll always be around and around and around

People come out of dark Alleyways with girls in wheelchairs ramming them into us.

We're in danger. We need your prayers.

I can actually shift psychic awareness.

Dogs are psychic buffers, way more psychic than we are.

I'll fly a spaceship called Minerva

Hi Kerry!

across the universe divide.

Fallen technology

And when I reach the other side

Jar Jar Binks

You know who that is?

No.

I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can

I'm not ready to start the show.

Perhaps I may become a highwayman again

I'm Neo I'm Leo, I'm prophet of Maxtrixism

Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

But I will remain

I am that Messiah, what can I do?

And I'll be back again and again and again

A cult of Celine. It's a satanic cult?

What? It's a cat. Noooo....

<blockquote>

First Jordan, let's say hello to some new wonks.

Ohhh, that's a good idea.

I dunno why you forwarded me this email.

You know why.

Because, this-- you don't want this.

No, I don't.

But they wanted me to sing as much of Wild Wild West as I want.

Oh, no no no, you misunderstood, I added the "as much as you want" part. They had "the entirety of the song" written out.

Well that might be how much I want.

Lyrically, the entirety of the son-- do you wan the lyrics? Cause it's on the email.

No! I know, I saw that, I don't need 'em.

Ok. Ok-- <Jordan Laughs> You're right!

Yea, I'm there.

You're right, I'm the fool,

So, thank you so much!

Wicki-wicki wild wild West

Jim West, desperado

Rough rider, no you don't want nada

None of this, six-gunnin' this, brother runnin' this

Buffalo soldier, look, it's like I told ya

Any damsel that's in distress

She'll be outta that dress when she meet Jim West

Jordan: You weren't enthusiastic at the beginning

Rough necks go check the law and abide

Watch your step, It's a hole in your pride

Jordan: But you're working your way there. Hehe, It's getting into ya.

Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react

You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at

With Artemus, from the song, that's runnin' the game

James West, tamin' the West, so remember the name

Now who ya gonna call?

The J B

Now who you gonna call?

J W G

If you wanna mess with any one of us

Break out, before you get bum-rushed

Jordan: The audience can't see this, but I am holy ghosting right now.

At the Wild wild west

When I roll into the Wild wild west

When I stroll into the Wild wild west

When I bounce into the Wild wild west

We're goin' straight to the wild wild west

We're goin' straight to the wild wild west

Now, now, now

Once upon a time in the West

Mad man lost his damn mind in the West

Jordan: Oh dammit, I thought we were good.

Loveless, didn't have a dime, none the less

Now I must, put his behind to the test

Jordan: I thought we had finished.

Go through the shadows, ready for battle

Bring all your boys in, here come the poison

Behind the back, of the riffin' again

Front and center, now where your lip at kid?

Who dat is?

Mean brother, bad for your health

Lookin' damn good, though, if I could say it myself

Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that

Jordan: DJ Danarchy, DJ Danarchy

He got mad weapons too? Ain't tryna hear that

Jordan: I need you to hear me

Tryin' to bring down me, the champion?

Jordan: I'm speaking to you through time.

When y'all clowns gon' see that it can't be done

Jordan: This is just for you <laughs>

Understand me, son, I'm the slickest they is

I'm the quickest they is

Did I say I'm the slickest they is?

So if you barkin' up the wrong tree, we comin'

Don't be startin' nothin', me and my partner gonna

Test your chest, Loveless

Can't stand the heat, then get out the wild, wild

Wild, Wild, West

When I roll into the wild, wild, West

Jordan: Oh my god, it's still going!

Anyway, you're now a policy wonk.

I'm a policy wonk.

Thank you.

I'm a policy wonk (wild wild west)

Pol-pol-policy wonk

I'm a policy wonk (wild wild west)

Pol-pol-policy wonk

I'm a policy wonk (wild wild west)

Bre-bre-breakdown!

Wild wild west

I love you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...a-a-a-and everybody loved me doing the English accent.

You don't have a snotty-- shut up!

Do you hear that I have a snot nose?

I am Piers Morgan, my dear boy.

Go ahead now, you've pathetic little worm

I do not breathe through my snoot, my proboscis while I talk to you, you little man.

I'm sorry, go ahead, go ahead.

So people across the border united in their outrage that it's now a racial crime to make fun of Scottish people.

You are the culture that created the Magna Carta and the common law and now look at you.

I've had enough of it, and no I'm not celebrating the Diamond Jubilee as you noticed.

So I'm not kissing the ass of Irish or Scots, literally when I read the documents and if you look at who fought the Civil War-- it was mainly Scots on the South Side.

They literally say in white papers there's something about Scots and Irish that we have to get rid of; they won't sell out; they won't submit.

Scotland is one of the most draconian countries in the Western World; You saw what they did to Count Dankula.

How 'bout spraying Scottish and Irish towns with nerve gas? Or bio weapons?

I'm more English in my, uh, pedigree than anybody else.

I love English culture, the UK, the whole nine yards.

Cause I'm Scottish, Irish, the whole you know, all of it, I'm German, Alsatian, French, to say that I'm anti-British or anti-Welsh or anti-Scottish or any of that it's just asinine, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, I am I- I- am-- and it's all Gaelic to begin with. It's all Celtic.

Silence the peasant immediately!

Can one of you on one of those gidget-gadget-spheres in there, get on them-- get on one of them internet tubelets and find me that clip.

Have we dumbed them down enough for me to do this?

Why oh, I'm Harry Potter and because I have a lisping English accent I'm-- everyone's going to believe me now.

====Lyrics====

<blockquote>Oh my goodness, look at that rabble in America, they own firearms, it's so horrible.

We're already training them with the constant brainwashing and calls to worship Brittania and hate their ancestral enemies the Frenchies, Ohhh the French.

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, and now, for all of you Anglophiles out there, prepare for the pain.

The funny thing is we're trying to save the dumbed-down British people, they are the attack dogs of the people that are soft killing 'em.

And nothing against England, I mean I've got a lot of English, ya know, blood myself. Ya know one of my ancestors, uh- Gresham, invented the stock exchange, on record.

I had British family came over on the mayflower, both sides!

And the King of England is the sworn enemy of humanity.

He couldn't stand the Queen of England, that's in mainline history books because, uh, she was a nymphomaniac, demanding sex up to 20 times a day!

Oh, you didn't know the Queen of England's husband was a Nazi? Ha ha ha ha...

You didn't know his cousin, that started the Bilderberg Group was?

If you don't wake up and say "no", you deserve to die.

And again folks, I've got extensive British lineage; so did George Washington and he absolutely defeated the Transylvanian King.

They're not British, they're not Scottish, they're not Irish, they're not Gaelic, they're not Viking. Prince Charles is the heir of Count Dracula. It's mainstream news!

They act like the queen doesn't run anything, folks, she runs that whole country. She shuts down roads in England every day, randomly, to exercise her power.

And everybody loved me doing the English accent.

You don't have a snotty-- shut up!

Do you hear that I have a snot nose?

I am Piers Morgan, my dear boy. Go ahead now.

I do not breathe through my snoot, my proboscis while I talk to you,

I'm sorry, go ahead, go ahead.

The show is called 8 out of 10 cats, and this is how our society is turning into a tyranny.

Everything is now a big joke.

The Queen of England has now joined with the United States and the West

and so the Transylvanian Queen knows which way the wind is blowing and can see that Trump and America are winning!

Now she's coming in like the Deuce (sic) Ex, the hero that comes at the last moment when the main hero is gonna lose.

Queen Elizabeth with this action has now become the Han Solo Deuce (sic) Ex at the moment.
