But if people want to throw down a little something, something we have some projects we want to work on. But anyway, Alex started in public access TV. Then his dentist father talked to one of his patients who was a radio executive and got him a radio job paid for his first AD, the American dream. Alex Jones, his first ad he bought your show, Alex Jones, his first ad that was a contingent part of him getting a radio show was his dad's dental practice. And so that's how he came into being. But he didn't really make it big outside of the Austin market where people thought he was kind of a crazy yeller, because he was yeah, he would go out that hasn't changed. He would go out in public with bull horns and make a big spectacle of himself and scream about banks and what have you, right, that was sort of his modus operandi. And because he was this crazy public figure. That's why Richard Linklater, who was an Austin filmmaker at the time, ended up putting him in waking life and then Scanner Darkly, a little bit down the road where he played characters, very similar to himself crazy. Street Preachers. in waking life. He's a guy yelling in a bullhorn, driving around in a car. And he's got a stretch for him, but he's yelling a bunch of stuff back then that I actually kind of cool with because they're all about human potential and stuff like that. He's screaming about how the indomitable spirit of humanity is great. He just leaves out all the globalists stuff is there

He's so cool. Also, I found evidence from 2015 that Alex Jones is not lying about smoking weed once a year. What that came out in his divorce case, or that's a true thing. He said in court during the custody case that he smokes weed once a year. Now, I knew that I knew that I said the exact same thing and 2015 That's crazy. He says he smoked weed once a year to check in on it to see what's going on with it. See what it does to people. That's crazy. It's like, I don't like weed. Turns out I dry it. I don't like it. It's nuts. It's nuts. That that isn't something that just came out of his mouth. He's been saying that for years. So anyway, Doctor group.

    | text      = But the reason that he ever broke through in conspiracy theory communities, and the reason that he got this elevated status as the champion of conspiracies, what made it really break was that he put out a video where he showed breaking into and infiltrating Bohemian Grove, right, in the hills of California. I believe it's in the north, the North Coast area. So anyway, that was in 2000. Allegedly, he infiltrated on July 15 2000. And he made the biggest fucking deal out of it. He made a video, started selling it. This is sort of the beginning of his documentary Empire started getting a lot of attention for it, because it was this mysterious place where powerful people go, and Alex Jones as he sells himself as the only person who's been able to break in, right. And the hallmark of it the big coup de gras is he got footage of the cremation of care ceremony, which is the most famous part of the video. It's the part that everyone who's seen it, it's parfait, remember, because the rest of it's fucking bullshit. It's a video of a giant stone owl, where they burn a figure in effigy. And he portrays it as a satanic ceremony where they're killing a baby. All this shit. Yeah. The realities of the actual ceremony are very different. But we'll get to that in a minute. He presented it as, like, Hey, I went in, snuck in. I went into the den of vipers secret agent style. I went in there with a camera, and I fucking got it. I got it. And they can't deny it. Right. Here's why he's busted.

Which, if you're counting is 11 years before Alex Jones broke in a journalist named Philip Weiss reporting for spy magazine infiltrated Bohemian Grove for six days. No shit, six days, he's just hanging out. I would like to read a couple of excerpts from his column. So this is from Philip Boyce's article and I quote, for me, the trick was getting in a guest card was out of the question. Club bylaws have stated that a member sponsors application, quote, shall not shall be in writing and shall contain full information for the guidance of the board in determining the merits and qualifications of the proposed guest. No. Section Eight article 18 was to find a screen for me and my attempts to get a job as a waiter or a valet and one of the camps failed. In the end, I entered by stealth. Some observers of the grove have warned that security was too good. They'd sniff me out immediately. I might last three hours before they put me in Santa Rosa jail for trespassing. Lowell Bergman, a producer with 60 minutes who used to hunt rabbits in the nearby hills remember to fire road leading into a site near the grandness Ville waste treatment plant, but said they'd spot me sneaking in. Others mentioned barbed wire and electronic monitoring devices and places where the grove abuts mount Rio and helicopters patrolling the ridge roads that traverse the 1000 foot hills and formed the groves perimeter.

My driver was Mary more in Earth Mother type with long silvery blonde hair, who's the most active member of a distinctively California and left wing group called the Bohemian Grove Action Network, more agreed to help me get in providing me with a sort of underground railroad. She put at my service a mountain guide who demanded only that I keep the methods he devised for me confidential. He had a keen geographical sense. And a girlfriend who described a plan to seed magic crystals at the grove gates and make them open up have their own accord so the Native American drummers could walk in. We didn't do it that way.

So he like I said he stayed there for days, and just hung out and did all the stuff along with them. And one of the things that he said is that the key to his disguise was always have a drink in hand. Because everybody is drinking. Everyone's just drunk. There's people passed out in bushes, right. And so he just described it essentially as being a crazy, super powerful, rich people summer camp. Yeah. And we'll get we'll get back to that in a second. Like he had to have a reason to be there. Yeah, so here's what he did. My imposter included misrepresenting myself in conversation with other campers. And my story kept changing as I learned more about how life inside was organized. I said I was a guest of Bromley camp, where unsuitable visitors ended up at 33. I was one of the youngest bohemians, but I was welcome almost Just as a policy matter, quote, we looked around and saw we were becoming an old men's club, a member said explaining recent efforts efforts to recruit fresh blood.

And I brought along my own version of cyanide in are all a tranquilizer used by actors to counteract stage fright. One day a member asked if I was related to a bohemian named Jack Weiss. No, but I've heard a lot about him and I'd like to meet him. You can't he said he's dead. After that, I began working a dead West Coast relatives promise to have me out to the grove one summer into my shaggy dog story about an invitation. Very nice. So basically, he's in the mix. He's just hanging out with these people, and, and hanging out drinking with these superpowers. No one sniffs him out. He ends up bringing a camera on the last day because he's like, Oh, if I get kicked out, whatever, this is my last day here. Yeah, too late now. So yeah, he ends up too late now. Motherfuckers You can't catch me. He ends up hanging out with him. He goes to the cremation of care ceremony that Alex Jones videotapes and misrepresents as some sort of a satanic thing. The the reality of it is, is that the cremation of care ceremony is this thing, where you have all these super powerful people who have crazy stressful lives, it's much the same as like really rich people often go to dominate tricks is right to get the power taken away, rather have a symbolic power exchange. In the same way, these supers are

Put on little musical numbers. Have people give speeches? And that's basically a lot of what goes on there. There's a lot of politics discussion that goes on now too much more than originally, it's a Borgia party. Yeah, yeah, more or less. So the cremation of care ceremony is where you have a manifestation of care who comes in which is this this what is burned in effigy eventually. And it is this, this, this idea of de stresses and the cares of the outside world. And they bring it in on a on a boat, a pontoon boat, to this ritual space in front of the giant owl of wisdom, the giant owl Moloch.

And one question keeps jumping out and that is, why do all of the things that seem the craziest about Bohemian Grove? Why is none of that on camera? Why is that just Alex's narration over shots of trees and stuff like that. He talks about how he sees surveillance equipment everywhere, but he doesn't show wires going all around the trees as in show, none of that is on camera. Okay. He talks about seeing all sorts of things and none of it is presented within the documentary. Further. He says that he gets accosted by sheriff's on his way in to try and break And it's not on tape. He just says that it happened. There's no reason to believe that it actually happened. When you're making a documentary you really got to show and prove. Yeah, what you're doing. Yeah.

And it says half an hour later, to try and create the illusion that he hiked around in the woods. So far, he walks so far this awesome video that I've linked to here on a knowledge by.com. Like I said, I'll post the link. This guy took Google Maps, and found the spots exactly where Alex was.

    | timestamp = 00:20:52.000
    | text      = Basically, what he ended up doing in that alleged half hour is walked about 50 feet. He made almost like the area that he would have to walk to get to where he says he ends up this parking lot this parking area where he ends up and gets picked up by a shuttle. What is so close to the external road? There's no way that it would take half an hour cheese even with his bloated out of shape ass right? There's no way it's just literally impossible. The only explanation? He got an in he got a guest pass. No. Oh, I don't know if that's possible. A lot of conspiracy theorists think that. Yeah. A lot of weirdos on the internet are like, obviously, it's because he's part of the globalists, that makes perfect sense. And he was just there because they wanted to expose it perfect, right? The more likely reality is if that half hour delay did happen. It's Alex Jones took a nap. It's Alex Jones fucking psyching himself out in the middle of the woods. Yeah, he's like, he's afraid to try and break it. Right. That's possible. And that's why it's cut. Yeah. The other possibility is he wants to present it as it's super hard to get in. But as Philip Weiss experience, it's really not those kind of walk in. Yeah. And so I don't think he necessarily had a pass, or someone who is like you get in or whatever. Yeah, I think that the shuttle that shows up doesn't check people's IDs unnecessarily. So if you're in the Bohemian Grove parking area, which is clearly accessible, and really, as these Google maps show, not far from the road, right? If you're in there, they just pick you up and take you in. Hmm, because it's just a shuttle that runs consistently. So he gets in there. It's like an airport shuttle. Yeah. So the other problem is, if you look at it, it's it's laid out when he gets picked up by the shuttle. And then there's not a whole lot that goes on. And then he has footage of the cremation of care ceremony. And it's pitch black. It's just completely dark out. Right. So he's been hanging out. He must have Yeah, and none of that footage is shown. He just tells you what has happened. He's like, I went to this place, this place and this place, right? And then, bam, it's super dark out. It's the dead of night. And then they don't show how they leave. Hmm. So

He knew that this was a very opportunistic way he could make a name for himself, because he wasn't cutting it as a local conspiracy guy course. And so he maybe read Philip wises article, maybe he knew about the Grove, from these news reports that do exist from the past, right? And so I mean, why he'd have to go all the way to California from Texas. It's a big trip through he has to get something out of it, of course, so he knows he can sneak in pretty easily, but he has to present it as really difficult. Because otherwise this isn't the Secret Sacred Space that he's broken into. It's just you went to these old dudes gay camp. Yeah, enjoy it. So he gets in. And there's nothing nefarious maybe is

So people drinking a ton, right? And so he he narrates what he wants the audience to think happened, which isn't what happened. He just wandered around. People probably like, what's going on here? He's drinking. I don't know that it's fucking Alex Jones because he's not a media figure at this time. Right? So they he just blends in a bunch of drunk people. He sees the cremation of care ceremony. And it does if you don't know what it is, it does look fucking weird.
