In the hills of California. I believe it's in the north, the North Coast area. So anyway, that was in 2000. Allegedly, he infiltrated on July 15th 2000. And he made the biggest fucking deal out of it. He made a video, started selling it. This is sort of the beginning of his documentary empire, started getting a lot of attention for it, because it was this mysterious place where powerful people go, and Alex Jones, he sells himself as the only person who's been able to break in. right. And the hallmark of it, the big coup de gras, is he got footage of the cremation of care ceremony, which is the most famous part of the video. It's the part that everyone who's seen it, it's the part they remember because the rest of it's fucking bullshit. It's a video of a giant stone owl, where they burn a figure in effigy. And he portrays it as a satanic ceremony where they're killing a baby. All this shit. yeah. The realities of the actual ceremony are very different. But we'll get to that in a minute.

A guest card was out of the question. Club bylaws have stated that a member sponsors application, quote, shall not, shall be in writing and shall contain full information for the guidance of the board in determining the merits and qualifications of the proposed guest. No. Section Eight article 18 was too fine a screen for me and my attempts to get a job as a waiter or a valet in one of the camps failed. In the end, I entered by stealth. Some observers of the grove have warned that security was too good. They'd sniff me out immediately. I might last three hours before they put me in Santa Rosa jail for trespassing. Lowell Bergman, a producer with 60 Minutes who used to hunt rabbits in the nearby hills, remembered a fire road leading into a site near the Guerneville waste treatment plant, but said they'd spot me sneaking in. Others mentioned barbed wire and electronic monitoring devices and places where the grove abuts Mount Rio, and helicopters patrolling the ridge roads that traverse the 1000 foot hills and formed the groves perimeter."

Moore agreed to help me get in, providing me with a sort of underground railroad. She put at my service a mountain guide who demanded only that I keep the methods he devised for me confidential. He had a keen geographical sense and a girlfriend who described a plan to seed magic crystals at the grove gates and make them open up of their own accord so the Native American drummers could walk in.

So here's what he did. "My imposter included misrepresenting myself in conversation with other campers. And my story kept changing as I learned more about how life inside was organized. I said I was a guest of Bromley camp, where unsortable visitors end up. At 33, I was one of the youngest Bohemians, but I was welcome almost as a policy matter. Quote, we looked around and saw we were becoming an old men's club, a member said, explaining recent efforts efforts to recruit fresh blood. Being from New York was fine. The Grove limits retreat guests to out of staters, though clamoring by well connected Californians to visit the forest has resulted in the rise of the June Spring Jinx weekend."

Drinking, don't know that it's fucking Alex Jones because he's not a media figure at this time. So they he just blends in, a bunch of drunk people. He sees the cremation of care ceremony.
