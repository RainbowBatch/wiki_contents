Their their journalists went on strike, and that got resolved. But even after that, they they put in new Editorial Board members, who insisted on favorable coverage for certain politicians.

These these ISIS rebels that are trying to take him down, right. And that's all Putin is doing to when the reality is, I mean, if you read up on it, there's a there's a lot of indications that beyond just killing his own citizens, one of the things that Assad has really been trying to do is get Sunnis entirely out of the country, especially out of the portions of the country that are most important to him. Yeah. And that's why refugees have been able to get out in as high numbers as they have is because Assad is totally cool with them, just leaving the country. He's trying to get them out. It's not as much ethnic cleansing on a murderous level, although there is some of that. It's ethnic cleansing of his neighborhood. Yeah, basically. And Putin is totally cool with that, too. Because you get them out. It causes massive destabilization. Yeah. All over the place. Yeah. So the idea that all they're doing is trying to protect their own position is lunacy. And that's what Alex Jones believes in order to make it so they are the good guys. And we are the bad guy.

He says a lot of stuff. That's true. But it's just crazy. You know, talking about optics, I saw a story over the weekend, about Vladimir Putin and Berlusconi, the former president of Italy, and then Eastern Ukraine and Crimea at a famous vineyard. And they weren't, they opened up a bottle of 1000s of bottles of wine that were there that was 210 years old. You can just type in Putin, and Berlusconi in Ukraine probe for drinking Crimea wine. And this is a stunt they know, will reach out to the proletariat. At the time that that bottle of wine was court was produced Russia fully controlled Ukraine and fully controlled Crimea waiting there was part of Russia, that they're claiming that Putin and Berlusconi stole a bottle of wine. It was part of a PR stunt is promoting local Ukrainian wine, like, Oh, we're here with the farmers. Yes. Why and why it's very old. And then they reduce it down to the ultimate crime. BBC, CNN, Fox News, Associated Press, Reuters, French news agencies that Vladimir Putin is there looting the Ukrainian wine. The globalist overthrew the country two years ago, they put it into civil war, they appointed a government. They're bombing and shelling all over the country.

It recently came out in the salon article, Todd Nickerson the article where the guy comes out and explains that he has an attraction to children but would never act. Ah, yes. And Alex Jones has been saying that the globalists are going to try and mainstream pedophilia and try and make against pedophilia.

Well, I mean, it's just like I said earlier this week or last week, what do you think Jocelyn elders, when she was the swab and bringing her back up? The Surgeon General said we need to help the little children masturbate. It's about weirdos sexually getting their hands on your kids. Because if they can do that, they can do anything forced inoculations, you name it, and they don't California pass a lot for years. Why should you start getting kids inoculate?

Right, what is going on in the psychology of the people who are attracted to children, then it behooves you to have some understanding, that doesn't mean liking it. That doesn't mean accepting it. That doesn't mean mainstreaming it, but it does mean, like the end goal is not well achieved by murdering everybody who has attractions to children.

Wow, you remember that night story but that conspiracy of silence Yeah, documentary that's fucked up. Yeah, it is super fucked up.

I will use the language I can that Sandusky in the second mile were pimping out young boys to rich donors that was being investigated by two prominent colonists even as I speak. How does that sentence start? I have a rumor. So when he was pressed on it, he said this. I normally abhor giving rumors credence, but the whole Sandusky scandal started out as a rumor, it gets deeper and more disgusting all the time. It's a rumor. It's a rumor that some radio host put out into the world and Alex Jones has been peddling his entire worldview about these pedophiles and the REN fields and Dracula's basically on this, this is pizza gate shit. This is that level of like internet marberry the idea like I'm not trying to defend Sandusky or Joe Paterno, or anybody involved in this. They're all fucking awful monsters. No, I hope they all die twice. Absolutely. And clearly indications have come out the Joe Paterno was aware of this dating back to the seven Yeah, he knew like he's not innocent in any of this. So I'm not at all giving them a pass. What I am saying is it's irresponsible journalism on Alex Jones as part to try and create this broader spiderweb that's going on when in the truth. It's just, it's just a monster we can tell is it's one monster who is looking for his own victims. Yeah. So I I don't think in terms of official information. And maybe maybe there is something out there that I'm unaware of. And if that's the case, please feel free to tell me, but from what I've been able to glean the idea that there was procurement and pimping out of these children goes back to rumours as opposed to actual truth. Yeah. And like Alex, you got to do better, you got to do better. I understand that you want to launch conspiracy theories, and you want people to distrust mainstream narratives. You can't you can't just do this you really sensationalized a real problem to the point where you lose your credibility about that real problem right.

Alex Jones only has a career because his dad bought him array To show when he was younger by being his first sponsor, and giving him the perception of being self made, and you know, like building up all this stuff, and now he has an empire that's built on fake pills. Yeah. So like there is a pretty similar trajectory between the two of them, which I can understand Alex Jones, sort of seeing and relating to, and becoming enamored with. Yeah, I could see that. But at the same time, Alex, in the past had said that Trump is a con man, he said that he is a frontman for a consortium on the East Coast. He's mobbed up, he doesn't think that Trump is self made.

But even even that is him recognizing that as a hiding Jew during the Holocaust. George Soros had no ability to buck the system at all. Alex Jones is recognizing that. And he's still lying about what George Soros did, because he's still saying that he rounded up Jews and stuff like that, which he absolutely didn't. He bases all of this on a 60 Minutes interview that has nothing to do with this stuff. It's all bullshit. But be that as it may, I think it's particularly disgusting, that he recognizes that it would be certain death for George Soros to do anything out of line.

How dare you insult someone's decision in that kind of a situation? The only way you can do that is if you kind of deny the Holocaust. And it was mostly about Jews that didn't pay ransom. Yeah, that's really the only way you can do that. And not think of yourself as a fucking horrible person.

I don't know his whole history, I don't really care. It's not important to what's going on. The two of them have an interview. And the pope comes up.

One, whenever Alex Jones does one of those voices he's like, right, you can tell because that's a rhetorical trick he uses. Second, when he starts putting on the Malcolm X impression, you can tell that something's going on there, you can tell that he's full of shit and probably in a weird headspace because, you know, his rhetoric, you know, the tools that he employs, and if students in primary education would be taught those sorts of things, you'd be much more able to see a politician and be like, Oh, hold on now.

Not as big as what Kennedy did, but similar, and a whopping 10% levy on all which it should be like 50% on all the multinational US based companies that wrote the laws where they're tax exempt, so they take all their profits outside, Trump understands, we need to bring a large portion of that money back, but it shouldn't be 10% because they haven't paid more than 20 years, basically any taxes. They take their profits outside the country to tax exempt havens. And so we need to drag that money back in. It's time for the globalist General Electric Google. Apple. It's time for the fortune 100 Lockheed Martin, all you guys America built you gave you the power over the planet. And now you want to shrink it so you can politically control it.

He's just trolling people. Yeah, he's doing this like people kept posting that he's keeping a dossier of his enemies Dick sizes and stuff like that. That's that's just him trying to get more attention in the same vein as the we love our Somali song content. Yeah, it's all just trying to get people to bait. Just grab this bait.
