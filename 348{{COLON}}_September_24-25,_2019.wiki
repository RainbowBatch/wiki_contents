Today, Dan and Jordan look at how [[Alex Jones]] has been covering the massive news of the previous few days. Trump gave an anti-Globalist speech at the UN, the House launched an impeachment inquiry, and Alex announced some lawsuits he's filing. Yet, the most important news on this episode may be that Alex thinks someone who definitely was not a US president was actually a US president.
