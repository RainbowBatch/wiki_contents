He tells the audience that the globalists are on the ropes, and the good guys are gonna win just as long as you keep that money flowing. When Alex says reasons to believe that his schemes to keep his money safe from the courts aren't going to work well, and it's the end of the world. I was reflecting on why the present day episodes of Alex's show are so repulsive to me, when in reality, it's actual content isn't really much worse than it was in 2018. or around that time, right? One theory that I've come up with is that Alex's show in the present day is actively abusive towards its listeners in a way that's increased, and I think it makes me mad. This is kind of just him having a childish outburst on the show and trying to make everyone feel as miserable and panicked as he does. And it's not that fun to take seriously is something worth paying attention to. The only thing that even makes me raise an eyebrow here is that Alex is upping the ante from pretending he's about to leave Austin to pretending he's about to leave the country. Also probably not a coincidence that he chose Argentina as the country he'd like to flee to seeing as it was the destination of a lot of high level Nazis like Eichmann and Mengele.

But Alex supported Trump's decision, which is one of the specifics that Putin cites in his speech criticizing the US funny just weird. Funny how that works. It's a very, very long, boring speech. mostly about economic issues and the airing of grievances some valid, some outrageous Sure, the part where Putin brings up nuclear weapons is this, quote, we're aware of the fact that certain types of US nuclear weapons are reaching the end of their service life. In this regard, we know for certain that some politicians in Washington are already pondering live nuclear tests, especially since the US is developing innovative nuclear weapons. There's information to this effect Given these circumstances, the defense ministry and Rosatom must take everything must make everything ready for Russia to conduct nuclear tests, we will not be the first to proceed with these tests. But if the US goes ahead with them, we will as well no one should harbor dangerous illusions that global strategic parity can be disrupted. It is a bad sign for a head of state to be talking about a new nuclear arms race. But there's a chasm between what Putin said and how Alex is reporting it.

Wow. And it's starting World War Three right now. And so Trump knows if he was in the White House. He'd be in control of that robot. And Hillary said she wanted war with Russia if she got elected six plus years ago, but she didn't smile or fraud. And so for four years, we didn't have this war start. But now, a year after Biden gets in, it all kicks off. And US forces and NATO forces are in there. Killing Russians, Russians killing them. I mean, I know a lot of people NATO forces are not already served multiple tours in the Ukraine war, long before you absolutely do not watch the counter offensive multiple to it. And that's what the police action was. And I'm not defending Putin or Russia. I'm not a Russophile I don't lionize Russia. But Russia is not on our doorstep and Russia did not start this.

Alinsky is, none of that stuff that Alex is saying here is stuff that he can really substantiate. But I wanted to talk about the torture thing for a moment share. what Alex is referring to when he says that Zelinsky is torturing people to death on a regular basis is actually based on news that came out towards the end of last year that Ukraine had found torture chambers around Kharkiv that had been liberated. That's the area, the area that had been liberated that was previously occupied by Russia. Sure, those were Russian torture. Right? Right. Right. Ukrainian forces are not without criticism for actions that are taken, you know, in the context of the war. But what Alex is doing here is disgusting whitewashing for Russians, Russia is militarism. You could say that once all the facts are out in the open, he'll be shown to be a promoter of torture and human rights abuse. But I think we all know that he exists within his own reality. And that day of reckoning is never coming. Sasol still pretends that Trump is the president, like there's just, it doesn't matter. He can take like news about Ukraine, finding torture chambers in liberated areas that were previously held by Russia. And you can say, Oh, my God.
