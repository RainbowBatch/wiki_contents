And you know what, either study the British families in the 1850s that did all this what and they got nothing believe they're channeling the stuff and then envisioned a DNA. Why Atrix envisioned all the major sciences computers, and then went on and told her scientists start developing it. We've got to have the general public here about this so that the inventors come forward. So they got HG Wells, in the 1890s. And things start, and others start writing this knowing that, that the elites couldn't come up with it, but they've been given the knowledge. So they believe that they put out basically the basic template in predictive programming that then, because we're made the image of God, we're master builders, that that there would be humans that would then build it because they heard about it.

It's true that Trump's ascension opens up the possibility of normalizing Russia's relations with the West, beginning with a reduction or even elimination of sanctions. It also validates a lot of Russia's ideological criticisms of the liberal order, and may perhaps foreshadow policy reversals that Moscow has long hoped for, such as the Cold War Alliance breaking up and disentanglement

That's the only line that has anything to do with it. And I don't think that they're saying they're worried that that's going to happen. It's just that that would be a bad outcome. It would be a bad outcome, and they shouldn't be worried his ouster Kremlin insiders argue is bound to unleash a virulent and bipartisan anti Russian campaign in Washington agreed oddly, therefore, Putin has become a hostage to Trump's survival and success. This seriously restricted Russia's geopolitical options. The Kremlin is perfectly aware that Democrats want to use Russia to discredit and possibly impeach Trump, while Republican elites want to use Russia to deflate and discipline Trump. The Russian government fears not only Trump's downfall, of course, but also the possibility that he could opportunistically switch to a tough anti Moscow line in order to make peace with a hawkish Republican leaders in Congress.

This, this actually is pretty interesting and ends pretty interestingly, anyone who spends any time in Moscow will quickly discover that ordinary Russians, in contrast with a majority of Europeans feel surprisingly positive about Trump. One reason is that they're exhausted at Russia's confrontation with the West. Another is that they share Trump's cynical, borderline apocalyptic view of international politics. Like Trump, they never believed in Win Win politics in the first place. Most interestingly, of all, they readily compared Trump to an early Boris Yeltsin, impulsive, charismatic, trusting only of his family and ready to bomb the parliament if that works to cement his hold on power. The problem for the Kremlin is that Yeltsin was a revolutionary leader, and Putin has decided to make 2017 a year for deploring not celebrating revolutions, which goes back to the beginning of the article when he's talking about the Bolshevik Revolution, which is just good writing to tie the end back to the beginning of good writing when you're when you're talking foreign policy stuff, and it's kind of you're in the weeds a little bit like that article is the ability to bring the end back to the beginning. First of all, I tip my hat. That's good, right. Yeah. And then second. I mean, like, what do you know, when he says that, like it's deploring?
