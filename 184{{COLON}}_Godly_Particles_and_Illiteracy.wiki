Today, Dan tells Jordan all about a time travel request from Listener Johnathan, where the gents listen to Jim Bakker and some of his dumb friends talking about CERN. That is where the episode starts, but it goes so far off the rails that nothing in this description could ever help you make sense of what it is about.
