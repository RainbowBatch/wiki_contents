And I was there for like just a regular checkup and they found like this little bot behind my left eye and eye doctor like, kind of don't like that. But it's probably just scar tissue. Let's just keep an eye on it, which we did. I went into the eye doctor like, more frequently just to have it like measured in both size and location. For nine years, it stayed exactly the same. So this past December, December 22. It was literally only like 12 days, I think after like No 10 days after the 10 year anniversary of my mom's murder. Um, I go to like my routine checkup and the doctor is like, your scar tissue grew. And I'm like, How does scar tissue just randomly grow after almost a fucking decade? Right? So he's like, Yeah, you should probably go to a neurologist and I'm like, okay, never done that before. So let me like establish myself with a neurologist which if anybody's done that it's not an easy thing to do. There's long waits, whatever. So by the time so from that that initial I doctor appointment to the time I got to the neurologist, my what I thought was scar tissue was had tripled in size. Whoo. Yeah, yeah.
