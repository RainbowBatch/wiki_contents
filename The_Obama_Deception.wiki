'''The Obama Deception''' is an [[InfoWars]] "documentary" released in 2009, shortly after [[Barack Obama|Obama]] began his presidency. The thesis, insofar as the film has one, is that Obama is bad.

As might be expected, the documentary is a mess, both in terms of the content and the editing. Large portions are just recycled from [[Endgame]]. Knowledge Fight covered Endgame starting in Episode [[230A: Obama Deception, Part 1]].
