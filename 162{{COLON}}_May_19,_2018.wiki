Today, Dan tells Jordan all about a Special Report that Alex Jones put out on Saturday, May 19th. Alex doesn't usually work on Saturdays, so you know something serious is up. As it turns out, it looks like Roger Stone is in trouble, so Alex headed to the studio to vaguely threaten Robert Mueller and lie a bunch about some dead guys.
