    | text      = And it's because they are not only pedophiles that hate prosperity and blah, blah. Right. Right. Which is a remarkable one to one comparison, apparently. But the that is the other part. Oh, depressing. I know, I hate to end this on a bummer note. But like, the other thing that I think is important to remember is along those lines of if you believe that that's who you're up against, you would be passionately on that side, right? Consider that the person who's telling you that that's who you're up against. also believes that they're making chimera is in cowbell. Also, consider all of this other bullshit, consider that he believed that not why 2k was going to be concentration camps in Austin. Yeah, like, it's so like, I'm at the I'm at the point at the end of this episode, where I'm at this is about where I had to turn off. Yeah, the episode today because I was like this. That's terrific. No, no, that's just nonsense. Because it's, it's, we can laugh, and we do laugh. And we try. And there's still even within that clip. There's parts that are pretty fairly laughing. Yeah, yeah. But the reality is he's using these tricks to to fool people into passionately getting on his side. And that is, I believe, an act of propaganda and an act of evil.
