'''David Icke''' is a prominent British conspiracy theorist best known for his ridiculous anti-Semitic beliefs about reptilian aliens secretly living among us.

David Icke was a sports broadcaster in the UK, until he went on Terry Wogan's talk show in 1991 and declared that he is the son of God. From there, he went on to be laughed at for a while, but he came out the other side of it with a pretty respectable career giving lectures about the "Reptilian bloodlines" that control the world and have for generations.

He believes the [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of Zion]] are real (they are not), and he has signed off on almost every conspiracy theory out there.

Earlier in his career, [[Alex Jones]] openly distained Icke, claiming he was a "turd in the punchbowl" and implying that he might be intentionally making conspiracists like Alex look ridiculous. However, in more recent times, Alex and Icke have been closely associated. They were aligned on various elements of Covid-denialism, and Icke frequently came on Alex's show throughout 2020.
