'''Laura Loomer''' is a completely insane "investigative journalist," but more importantly an aggressive Islamophobe. She has actively advocated for banning Islam because she fervently believes that all Muslims are the same and she hates/fears them all. She used to work for [[Project Veritas]] and [[Rebel Media]], which makes her unemployable at any real journalistic outlet, so she is "independent," and shows up on [[The Alex Jones Show|Alex's show]] from time to time, generally to bash Muslims or to claim that various acts of white terrorism were false flags.

Laura seems to be in favor of political censorship of art, as she was behind the publicity stunt disruption of the June 2017 performance of Julius Caesar where Caesar was a Trump facsimile, being willingly obtuse that Shakespeare In The Park has done iterations of the show with Caesar being Obama and George W Bush in the past. She is so terrible that even most of the Alt-Right doesn't like her.
