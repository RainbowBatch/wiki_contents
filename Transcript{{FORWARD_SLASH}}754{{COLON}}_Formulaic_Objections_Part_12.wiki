And no greater information ever came out. And then in 2012, Haskell decided to run for Congress in Michigan, and he really didn't want to talk about that stuff. Quote, I consider it part of my personal life and not part of my campaign. I don't think it's relevant sounds like he's guilty. It's debatable whether it's relevant or not. One could suggest that haskel's actions speak to a lack of judgment and the consequences of that ripple to this day, and are used by people like Dan but donde to justify their other conspiracy bullshit activities. And that kind of light, maybe Haskell doesn't display leadership qualities that would justify him being in Congress. And then there's a little bit of weirdness that comes out in his interview with NPR, when he's asked if it's possible that he got people confused, and if it's possible to the person he saw with The Well Dressed Man was someone else. He says it's not possible. The cause for concern was that he said that The Well Dressed Man referred to the person with him as Sudanese, whereas Abdul Muttalib is Nigerian Haskell explained quote, There were very few black men or black people on this flight, and he's a rather different looking person. So it was pretty obvious to me. I wonder what he means by different looking because of dual Matala was pretty normal looking, as far as I can tell, share the things Haskell was saying immediately after the attempted attack were really interesting, hence the little bit of news coverage and outlets like NPR, but none of this is substantiated, and none of it proves anything. But for someone like donde and an outlet like Infowars, one person saying something that they can use as the equivalent of a smoking gun that closes the case. They're not very rigorous, is what I'm saying. Yeah, and but donde here even a decade later is still like citing this one thing. This one guy said, as like proof positive that, you know, this underwear bombing was fake in order to sell the naked body scanners. Yeah,

And so basically US News, world news, I don't know, Second Amendment news, stuff like that you get, if that explains it, right. And what I'll do is I'll put them on his desk, he'll go through the articles, decide what he wants to talk about. In the meantime, while he's on the air. We'll have several computers going on. And with the Tricaster, and everything. So basically just say, he says, there's a document out there that you say, hey, Char 2977, and Space Preservation Act 2001. to back that up, my job was to back them up. So to show on a screening, you think you did sources whether what he's talking about, it's not just coming out of his book, this is from documents sources. So if he's talking about the space and Preservation Act, and people like all that's wacky, caught up right from the Duck of website, put it right on screen as he's talking to scroll through it. So to back them up. And when he's talking about certain articles. Yeah, yeah, datacal there, but sometimes we pull up on screen and scroll through it, as he's talking about it. And I mean, General, things like that, and just basically, to be as supportive for a show. And he had an ERP stuff, you know, so we have 1000 things in my head at a time. So if he gets stumbled on some echo do in the microphone, I could tell him no, that was hr 2977. I mean, if he stumbled on remembered, things like that, you know, I mean, that in that nature, and also producing, telling him when I've got a break, and you know, that kind of nature.

It's like a magic trick where he has the appearance of knowing all of this stuff, when he's conceivably getting told those things.
