Today, Dan sits down with Jordan and explains to him some of the times over the years that Alex Jones has appeared on Russian media. The appearances range from the "apologizing for America" to "Alex actively getting compromised with excessive dishonest flattery."

We're not sure this proves anything, but it is an interesting glimpse into this aspect of Alex and how incredibly stupid he is.
