So there's a couple of things I want to point out first, but one of the big questions that we got was whether or not we got to ask him about his hatred of or Alex's hatred of him. And we didn't on air, although he did say we could ask him that. There wasn't time. And he's aware that he was very much aware that Aleksei oh yeah, oh, yeah. So that part we can confirm. And then the second thing I wanted to bring up visa vie that interview is our our parents had different responses.

It was interesting. Your three? Thanks, I Yeah, it's, it was all it was all a lot, but I appreciate them having us on. And I appreciate that they allowed us to not play into like, some of the, you know, like, hey, why don't you do a, you know, talk talk about Alex's XY or Z thing, and we're able to speak on the issue as we wanted to. And I appreciate that. That's something that, you know, maybe some people wouldn't think a media outlet would offer.

    | text      = Yeah. And, and, you know, I think I saw a little bit of feedback that it was a little bit of a shallow interview. And to that I say, fair enough. I mean, it was six minutes, you know, like, I mean, a little hit like that is not something that you can really dive too deep in. And, you know, you got to answer your question and get done and move along. And so, unfortunately, it doesn't know it may not satisfy people who want a thorough deconstruction of some of this stuff. But that's, I guess what the podcast is for. And yeah, it was it's a treat. And speaking of treats, Jordan, today, we have for our episode today, we are thrilled to be joined once again by Mark Bankston and Bill Ogden.

But it was to you know, it's very meaningful and something I'll I'll be always be very thrilled to have been able to be whatever small part of this that it was, and I appreciate them so much for allowing us to have, you know, a little bit of an inside track on some stuff and their generosity with the listeners and, and in us is is just so wonderful and unbelievable. I'm glad that we are able to have this sort of button a little bit, although maybe it's a button that will last all of sneakily well, it sneak week. You know, wrapping up some of this, this sort of chapter is very nice and being able to have a conversation with them to do that. I think everyone will will enjoy. I think it's great. So we could belabor this longer and just chat about nothing, but I gotta be honest, it's late. I gotta get this episode edited. And I

They don't understand anything about what's happening. And then what people have to remember is, is Jones through the company into bankruptcy, like mid trial? Yeah, and lifted the stay for this particular trial. So everything's going to bankruptcy court. We, you know, yeah, you've got a practical cap on this, where you've got 750 per claim. And then you've got two defendants per claim. So so as the cap was applied, you're looking at at like 4.5 million up on top of the 4.1 from the compensatory plus the 1.5. That they paid in sanctions plus a couple 100,000, they still have to pay in sanctions,

Yeah, wipes out the Bitcoin but like, like, like, here's the thing about that, though, is that, that because they put themselves into bankruptcy. And that means that the potential appeals that you could have, if you're going to be doing those over the next couple of years, they have to be like baked in to the value of how that gets done up and bankruptcy of say, value is going to be higher than what we actually have under the cap because that appeal, the the potential to have that that cap declared not applicable in this case, is gives enough value.

Because you have a damage cap on a case where there was a default judgment and there was even presumed damages in the nature of those claims. That if you now do a constitutionality challenge to this, like it's the day that we've been waiting for a case the sad part is that's not gonna happen. We're never gonna get to the Supreme Court because we're gonna get valued in the bankruptcy court so you leverage the appeal on that value. And the thing is is you got you got Maddie coming in with his was a nine plaintiffs. You've got two more and with Posner and Taylor us and believe me by that time when that state gets looked at, we're just gonna absolutely kick their teeth now in that case, I mean, yeah, that case the damages and that gets our PA King stunning.

And I did. I'll tell you I felt bad for a moment. But I need to tell a story that that I've told on the record in court, so again, not telling tales out of school. But the first time I met Renault back in March, when he was coming in to defend their other lawyer who got found for tampering evidence. And I think that's originally why they brought in a criminal lawyer. He walked up to me outside on the steps out in front of the courthouse, and he tried to do some sort of psycho SIOP stuff you know, mess with your opponent's heads and stuff. And then he eventually tells me something along the lines of like you're never getting a dime off this case, or your clients are never getting a dime off this case. And like you're about to do a bunch of work haha, hinting at this fraudulent bankruptcy he's about to file and then that should just collapses on itself. All of everything goes south, he ends up owing having his client over a million dollars and sanctions which he pays in the middle of trial. They actually hand me that check and get that on over. And now he ends up with this moment. i Yeah, it's just desert you if you were to come in in this case, and try to defend it like with some sort of principled advocacy, that's one thing, but if you're coming in just to be the bag man for Alex Jones, proto fascist madman, like, whatever, no, you get every bad thing that's coming to you. And right now, oh, my God, are the things dropping on him right now he's in Connecticut, do the show cause hearing for discipline, all of that Jones has actual malpractice claims against him. Roger Stone is begging him to sue him saying, you know, the narrative. It's the same shit, it's false flag again, it's Eric Holder, put this guy and somehow weaseled him into Jones's confidences and like intentionally jokes about

But what is nice, what is really going to savor every moment is this downfall, this exit of Jones from the American stage is going to take a considerable amount of time and expose them to a considerable amount of danger.

We watched some jury selection now is that this dude started jury selection by going up to every juror being juror number one, Miss Miss Miss Rodriguez, whoever it was right. You know, Miss Rodriguez, will you talk to me? And they'd be like, oh, yeah, I guess and then before they can even say anything go in the next year. juror number two, we talked to me. juror number three. We talked to me. And he did this for 16 Straight jurors. And then it goes so goddamn awkward that he would just be like, third row, what are you talking about? Right. And I said that to him, which on the camera looks ostensibly like I'm being a peacemaker, and trying to throw him down. It was just an absolute kick to him. Like it was just a little. Yeah, that's so he shot the bird. But what you'll notice in that, in that video, I have stopped paying attention to him by that moment, I'm looking over talking to somebody else. I didn't even know we did it until the next day. And yeah, the judge was absolutely furious about him doing all of that, that

Here's the thing is is is I don't know if you're saying that that that it felt that way from the defense, for example, because they kept pushing that sort of issue on liability. That was that was semi invited by us in a way because because by the way, we were going to put on the punitive case, we were kind of making it about all that again, right? Like we did a lot of heavy focus on just how bad their conduct was, because that's what determines the amount of punitive damages, right, it's how rad they were. So the exact same evidence that we would have shown to show that they were liable. With some rare exceptions of some things, we didn't have to prove by prima facie evidence like whether they published it sure like that, oh, that other evidence would have been the same. In a regular trial. If this default hadn't trapping, that trial would look largely the same, right? And so because we were the ones who casted is that because obviously, you want to front load these punitive damages, you want that to be the thing you want the jury to be thinking about, so that whatever your convinced stories are you get a boost on that then

We, the, the one thing I will say is that when you, when you go through trial, you get close to your clients, you don't have a choice, you're with them every day, and you talk with them. And that's where you get to really appreciate them as people. And the more and more that I met Neil and Scarlett, you know, at times, I would, you know, at times you get frustrated for certain things that I'm not going to, you know, nothing bad. But just to kind of, of course, some of the some of the surrounding circumstances that were going on outside of us in the case that were going on during the trial. But I will say that they, it was there's a surreal illness feeling whenever they both took the stand, and they told their stories and completely separate ways. And I think when that happened, you know, it didn't happen until day five. And so everybody had heard this, this ridiculousness and craziness and there was all these moments of just witnesses getting bloodied over and over again, and then all of a sudden, they took the stand, and the mood shifted a little bit. And even for me, and I know, for me, I think all of us, we talked about it more, when that moment hit, it kind of got me back on track of like, this is what, let's go light this thing up for real because this, as fun as those moments can be professionally, when when you hear from the person that you represent, how it actually affects them, it empowers you to really, you know, put your foot down on the throttle. And I mean, you can see that that's kind of what happened. Because after that, it was just like a bunch of surgeons in an operating room, just cutting things down, and, and then all kind of got put back together.

And it's one of the things that particularly offends me, I guess. Maybe it's me taking something personally that I don't need to, but about when Alex describes you guys as like, ambulance chaser? Yes. And, and this to know how much you all do actually care. It adds an extra layer to that that I think is is, you know, so undeserved. And I mean, obviously, yeah, it's not all about you guys.

I would say that we're in the minority, but don't, but it's not as big of a minority. It's not as small of a minority as you'd think there are a lot of plaintiff's attorneys that do personal injury work out there that truly do do it for the right reasons and in the right ways. But it's here to get overshadowed by Yeah, you get it's it's overshadowed by the you know, some attorneys that have pushed certain limits that they shouldn't have or done things that they shouldn't have. And, and that's always gonna happen in any profession. But yeah, I, I mean, it's when you guys have less than Kyle on you, they'll tell you, I mean, they have a decade's worth of stories before I do. You know, they represent, you know, they, they have clients years and years later that are, you know, quadriplegics that will still text them. And they still, you know, they they check up on him and they keep up to him because you do care. It's hard not to when we don't do it, you know, it's rare that you're gonna go do a case where somebody got rear ended in a school zone, and has, you know, $30 worth of chiropractic and you're going to take you to trial. Those are trials we do. So if we're trying the case, it's significant. And because of that, it's we try hard not to get too emotionally invested, because it'll mess with our performance on how to do our job. But at the end of the day, it's impossible not to care about these people because I there's been very few people, if any, I can't think of any off the top of my head that deserved what happened to them.

And Ben has a little duck that Scarlett gave him that's has the Jesse Lewis choose love on his T shirt. And that's his Jessie duck. And he loves that little Jessie duck like you wouldn't believe. And, and he knows a little bit, he knows enough now about what happened to understand what I'm up there doing that this horrible thing happened to these parents and they lost their little boy. And there's a man who's just being awful to them and just tormenting them like he understands that. And when I came through the door, he just came bounding up to me and like look of just pleasure in his eyes of Daddy's back from his trial, Daddy's back for a short grab me around. And every damn thing from these last two weeks melted off of me like like snow in of it just came off of me. And like everything I was thinking about all these outside influences, and just the focus of that little boy hugging me. I broke me down like I had a I had a night where I just just stopped for a minute and and thought about where all this lead. And it was.
