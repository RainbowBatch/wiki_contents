I don't disagree with it to some extent, right. That's not the bridge. We have to cross now. Right? Because that work is done. Yeah, the interview has been done. And it's going to air barring some sort of crazy sponsor pull out. Yeah. And we can't,

So when you introduce him into the world where sponsors do have a say, you then turn it into a thing where like, oh, sponsors are pulling out? That's right, because I'm so dangerous, right? Everything plays into his hands, except for one very specific thing that I'll be laying out over the course of this episode. Okay, because this is, in essence, the third installment of our how not to cover Alex Jones, our ongoing series that will continue until he's penniless.

    | text      = right? And attacking him in hacky and mundane ways? Yeah, are playing into his hands intensely, right. I sat down the other night, and I tried to write a Twitter thread about how this is a major opportunity. And if people really want to make headway against Alex Jones, there is a path we can proceed down. But no one is doing it. It's hard. Everyone is just getting mad about Sandy Hook. And I understand why. It's horrible.

Wait, what? Yeah, that was in the article. A condition of her probation was released was that you can't listen to Infowars

    | timestamp = 00:04:48.000
    | text      = Yeah, to an extent. So all that is awful. And I get why people want to focus on that. But even in that scenario, even in that tiny kernel, there's something so much more important that we need to like the issue that should be pressed on Alex is not. Why do you think that nothing happened in Newtown? Because that's a question he's been ready to answer forever.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | text      = So the question that Megan Kelly should have asked in regards to Sandy Hook, and maybe she did I don't know, the whole interview hasn't come out when we're recording this. So I don't I don't know what she asked. And a lot of the things that we have to go on as assumption, past history of TV news specials, right? And the trailer that they put out, the questions you should have asked is set it up by saying, let's talk about your position on Sandy Hook. That puts a trap down for Alex to walk right into, right, because his narrative that he spins now and he spends in the trailer is that we had debates. We heard both sides of it. Sometimes for devil's advocate, we said all these things. Yeah. So you say that, then play him this clip.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 00:06:25.000
    | text      = Yeah, show shandy hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors. In my view, manufactured I couldn't believe it. At first. I knew they had actors there, clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids. And it just shows how bold they are. That they clearly used actors. I mean, they even ended up using photos of kids killed in mass shootings here in a fake mass shooting in Turkey. Show Yeah. Or Pakistan. The sky is now the limit. I appreciate your call.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:07:00.000
    | text      = So you play that clip for him. And that is where the real question is. Which is why are you lying about what you said in the past? It's not about Sandy Hook necessarily. The important question is, Why are you pretending that wasn't your position? It's very publicly available? Yeah, that's a question he's not ready to answer. And it's not an answer, or it's not a question that he can answer without stepping into a huge pile of shit. There's no conceivable answer to it other than I was lying back then. Right. Yeah, I was caught up in propaganda back then. And I pitched this narrative, I didn't think there would be consequences. I didn't realize how bad that would look in hindsight. Yeah. Or he would have to say, I found evidence that it wasn't fake. And I I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. I said those things which he can't do. He can't do
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:07:53.000
    | text      = either of them. No. So his position would have to be I was playing devil's advocate, but he wasn't you. You have to listen to that and go, No, he wasn't weren't it wasn't at all. That was unequivocal.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:08:05.000
    | text      = He was explaining what he saw the reality as to his audience. He was directly saying it to a listener who was calling in, and everyone else was the surrogates. Yep. They were the surrogate callers who were being trained and taught in the McCobb arts of false flaggers.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:08:21.000
    | text      = And even more important than that was that in that clip, he says, I didn't believe it at first. And now I do so so you can't call that devil's advocate. That's you coming to a realization.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:08:35.000
    | text      = Yep. And there has to be something that led him to that. Yeah. But again, it's not to get to like, why are you a monster? How could you deny that hook?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:08:44.000
    | text      = It's why did you lie? Right? Or are you going to apologize
}}

    | timestamp = 00:08:48.000
    | text      = for what is the nature of your deceit in this case? Or are you going to say you're wrong? Or I'm dumb? Yeah, I fell for this. Yeah. That is the trap that you would set with that sort of a question. If you ask him. Why would you do that to those families? It sounds like there's going to be an emotional resonance to it. But it doesn't work with him. He's not gonna. He's ready for that. Yeah,

We're going to deal with a lot of damage control about Megyn Kelly, in the in the beginning, then we're going to get to some really fucked up stuff. And at the end of this, I am going to play you a clip that I think indicates that Alex, on our last episode back from 2015, Alex Jones, quote unquote, jumped the shark in in his conception Yeah, in this episode, Alex Jones legitimately invalidates the last 20 years of his career. No shit. Yep. And we'll get to that clip. again so there's a T You son of a bitch as a tease listen to the end. So we're gonna start at the beginning

    | text      = Ladies and gentlemen stories to all hell is breaking loose. And I couldn't clap victory victory victory victory. Infowars is absolutely dominating and the globalists are so upset. Look at these headlines Chelsea Clinton blast Kelly for Alex Jones interview the hill, Sandy Hook mom blast Megyn Kelly for upcoming Alex Jones interview. Megan Kelly, NBC under fire over sickening Alex Jones interview. This is totally coordinated NBC bull. This is all PR especially out of Megyn Kelly, and Chelsea Clinton. So we know that you know hanging out with this is incredible. And Megan Kelly lied to me and said it wasn't a hit piece said that she wasn't going to get into these topics. And like Trump says better watch out there might be tapes. There's no question about there might be tapes. And I just knew I was walking into a trap. Because MSM doesn't get it no matter what they do, then why did you do ask me they're already discredited. They have the zombies that watch them. But that's it. Everybody else then just gets reminded to the show. So it grows even faster. Only those millions of people see you're in the WikiLeaks talking about Haitians dying because of your foundation, how your mommy and your daddy stole all the money, but you didn't do anything. And all the corruption and Jerry Epstein's pedophile airplane, all of it, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm just going to come back in the next segment. And I'm going to lay out a whole Megyn Kelly headpiece and what how they're going to edit it and what they're going to do, because I already know, already know,

Of course, he knows, we all know. Yeah, what the what the what the essence of the interview will be. Nice jabs on Chelsea Clinton there. He really should stop bringing up Jeffrey Epstein's plane, because Trump was on it to like he just whenever he brings up how Clinton was on the quote unquote, Lolita Express, like Trump, but did too. They were friends also. You can't, you can't just like oh, no, I'll just ignore that part of it. So he has to frame the interview as a hit piece that's important to his his narrative working. And maybe that's fair. I don't know.

I would seek to explain to him and to illuminate to the audience, the link between his past and his propaganda. That's what I would seek to do. If I were doing a story on him. It would not be a hit piece in the in the sense that I want to, you know, like score points off him or something like that. But I would try to make clear all of your toxic masculinity. All of these things that you have about I'm a man by all of that is very easily traced back to your relationship with your mother, that you've explained yourself on the air. I would lay that out.

And I was I was in Columbia, Missouri. Yes, I was in college at the at the University of Missouri at the time, and I was walking by the speaker circle, which is a place where you know, it's supposed to celebrate free speech. You'd have protesters out there a lot, but basically, it was just for this insane preacher named Brother Jed to scream at people already big fans, your whores that sort of stuff. Already. Big fan. Yeah. Real fun for a day. And then super annoying. Yeah, of course. But I was walking by and I heard him screaming about my dad. I was like, though, this is a twist. I didn't even know my dad had written this article about the passion of it. So I went into his room screaming about how like, you can't expect to find truth at an institution where religious studies is taught by Professor freezin. And I was like, Whoa, oh, right, my man. So I asked him like after he got done preaching civic notoriety, I like it after he got done preaching. And he was having a cooldown period. I walked up to him was like, hey, you know, like, I was curious. Like, you're screaming about my dad. I was just wondering, you know, is like, what are you talking about? Like you yelling about?

Yeah, those are two things that he really really cares about when he gets worked up. It's usually about those things. Yeah. So to my estimation from my now six months of intense research on him, Oh, you poor bastard. Why Operating theory that I think is bearing out is the conspiracy stuff is intentional. It's a glittery, seductive element to get people to pay attention and think that he is someone who tells the truth about stuff. Then once you're in all of these white narratives start to come up all of this victimhood narratives, everything about how like white people with a real oppressed race. Yeah, that sort of stuff. It all comes up. And that's the main function of what he's doing. He's tricking people into buying his survival goods, formerly gold. And then now also, more importantly, radicalizing dudes into white nationalism. Yeah. And whether that's intentional or not, and whether that was the case years ago, I'm not sure.

If you look at representative samples, there's a reason that this show specifically appeals to dudes. Further, it's 83%, white 3% African American. So that mean, the population is something to the effect of like 13% African American, you would expect something much closer to that if it wasn't a massive aberration. Now beyond that, the audience is something to the tune of right around 60% over the age of 45. So we've discussed that before in the past, but that's an update because the numbers have changed a tiny bit. Now you look at the sources that he trusts. And he cites we have World News Daily 74% Male 26% Female 86%, Caucasian 4% African American, by 65% over the age of 45. So here's sort of a similar picture. Yep, Zero Hedge 88% Male 12% Female 83% Caucasian, 2% African American, something around 55% over the age of 45. Drudge Report, which is the most popular of all these sites that I've listed 89% Male 11% Female Jesus fucking Christ. 90% Caucasian 1% African American? Yep. Wow. 73% over the age of 45.

Were when I was on but Even Megan told me privately, or she thought privately on that, oh, I destroyed him. Because after I was on his program, his rating started dropping every day consecutively. Because we just call these folks out. And so Megyn Kelly is playing with fire, obviously, and nothing can save her show. Nothing can say mainstream media. Mainstream media has abysmally low ratings. They've gone up a little bit attacking Trump, because it makes media interesting again, but compared to 10 years ago, they're a shadow of the former self. You know, I went into the Gorgon lair. I went in to Medusas palace, and I, I engaged her on her terms. I let her be here from 930 in the morning. She got here at noon, but a crew at 930 until almost 11 at night. I let her have her way, because I knew it'd be rigged. I knew she was lying to me. I knew she was deceiving. I knew it was a giant hit pace. But they wanted me to go happily along with it and say nothing before it aired. I'm not going to do that. But understand I win by going in to the Gorgons pit and I survived. I survived going into that layer. And that's what it's all about. In fact, she hid over there in the dark. She hid over there in the dark when she first got here slithering in like the Gorgon.
