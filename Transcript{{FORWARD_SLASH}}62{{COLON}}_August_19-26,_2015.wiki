Even CNN admits 1000s of Chinese women sometimes 10,000 a week, come in on a visa for tourism, have their baby and have it all paid for and then their kids a US shoe medicine. And Chinese newspapers advertised come to America, get everything for free. Now, I agree the immigrants aren't the bad people. Overall, there are a lot of good ones, while the people coming here to do that are being leeches and the politicians that allow those laws to be in place are and so are you ever going to see the perspective a little more like Trump and I do about the fairness issue of these borders?

And this is unfortunate for Breitbart and for Paul Joseph Watson and for Alex Jones and Infowars as a whole, because one of his classmates, Shaun King, Kings classmates came out and actually gave an account on Facebook of what happened in the assault that John King was the victim of. And I'll just read it here, too. And I, I hate I hate to giving any sort of like, trigger warning. No, I mean, I hate I hate to discussion of anything that's kind of violent and stuff like that, because I'm not I feel like I'm exploiting a being exploitative, but at the same time I want, I want to draw a line between what's real and what Paul Joseph Watson is suggesting. Yeah, he's suggesting that the injuries were minor, and it was one person who jumped him. And here is the report from a gentleman by the name of che Gould. Unfortunately, it seems that several groups on the internet are spreading lies about an event that happened at my high school when I was a student there. This is a problem for me because they weren't not firsthand witnesses, nor are any of their sources. I however, was there and I saw it happen. I've been asked to post my memory of that day, which I'm happy to do. It involves another student at the time Shaun King. I was a senior in high school and it just walked out of the band room when I saw Shawn walking towards me in the hall. For my entire high school career. I cannot recall saying anything more than hello to him. However, this day, no exchange took place. Because before it could happen, Sean was quite literally ambushed by a large group of large people. He never saw what hit him. He never had a chance. I didn't stop to count how many attacked him. But the number was easily in the neighborhood of a dozen. There. They were both they were big white farm boys, all members of the FFA Future Farmers of America. Immediately a crowd formed while they stomped the life right out of Sean, who couldn't have weighed more than 100 pounds, if at all. I remember not being able to get close, certainly not close enough to interfere. The attackers had formed a circle around the debacle and what would not let anyone in. It stuck in my mind for years is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. It couldn't have lasted long. As soon as the chaos attracted the attention of two teachers it was over and the attackers definitely dispersed. There was blood all over the floor. I hung around in Mute horror, not believing what I just seen. I had had a fairly sheltered upbringing and it was my first brush with violence that had left an impression. So now, in 2015, various organizations on the internet have taken the stance that this incident never happened. This view seems to stem from one specific article making the observation that the police account and public records of this incident do not coincide with Sean's account. For example, the police report says there was only one attacker not a dozen. It also states that Sean's injuries were very minor. What the article does not discuss is the political and social climate of that place in time, and how these factors had an effect on the fallout from this incident. This is Versailles pronounced Versailles, Kentucky in 1995. I believe the population around that time was about 6000 or so. One of minority gets almost beaten to death at a small rural towns High School. It is every civic leaders nightmare in 1995 and for sale, it could have potentially made national headlines had the story gotten out, but unfortunately it did not. And no residents of Versailles Kentucky should be surprised. By this point in the reading you should have surmised that any investigating officer would have felt heavy, intense pressure from all sides. The last thing Woodford County High School wanted was for this story to be on the front page of the local paper. You don't have to interview school administrators to know that the city's elected leaders did not want this thing getting out because they wanted to keep their jobs and the local police needed to keep a tight lid on it so they would not look like jackasses. So Sean's injuries were downplayed to just a scratch on the police report. The Future Farmers of America guys had planned ahead for one of them to take the fall for all of them. The investigating officer was happy to put that detail in his reports. Nor was he eager to interview witnesses having never asked me a single question. When you read about incidents like these, it's very easy to imagine the details were left out memories are hazy things are made up. If you're having such reservations about this story, please understand that I have no agenda. I was not close with Sean in high school, and I have not spoken with him since I'm in no way related to his efforts to combat racism. Nor was I ever close with his attackers. I relate my memories of that day only so people will know what really happened. I was one of the few people that saw it with their own eyes. So fuck you Paul. Joseph Watson's

But if you remove the spoil rottenness, and bring back chivalry, to a free market, and that means if you want to fight a man, or you want to go out the street and shoot each other, it's legal to do so. I've studied history, we have to return total free market, but also chivalry. The gang thugs won't be acting tough in the streets anymore. Because if they mess with the family, you can demand satisfaction. Another leader has to come out on the street, whether you buy by shorter by gun, and I mean, you Oh, that's backward. No, that's not backward. That's what built civilization. That's why people were very, very polite. You go to places like Spain, or Italy, or just 150 years ago, you smart mouth, somebody they call you out the street. I mean, you think the American West was the only place where guys would go out in the street and shoot each other. That's what duels come from. That's where all of this originates from. Many of our founding fathers killed people in duels. But there was much lower overall motion were very, very respectful. Because if you were going to shoot your mouth off, you're going to have to make good on that check your mouth, can't write checks, it can't cash and there wasn't welfare, and there wasn't a society based on obsessing over language and all this garbage. What they do is they have a society where they remove responsibility. And then they replace it with political correctness is the new chivalry, anti chivalry all about pulling down the strong pulling down the honorable and having gangs of ninnies be able to engage whatever crime they want, but then you selectively can be shut down and persecuted by the pool.

No. So one thing that's important is that it happened at 645. In the morning, Alex Jones gets on air at 11 Central. So that would be what I mean, six, six o'clock. Eastern is when it happened. So that would have been five Central. All right. So anyway, the manhunt that happened, trying to find Vester Flanagan wasn't really even resolved. By the time Alex Jones gets on air, right. A lot of the information isn't there. All that is there is we know that two people were shot. And lots of people have seen the footage. I remember this day, particularly because I know a lot of journalists. I have a lot of people who I went to college with who were journalism students, and some of them I hated, but some of them were good friends of mine I care about very much.

He goes by the name Bryce Williams, but his real name is Vester Flanagan and he reportedly the police say turn the gun on himself after a dramatic Chase.

Yeah, this was just a murder directed specifically at specific people. Whereas the Charleston was a act of racial terrorism. Yeah. Now, just because there is a racial dynamic in both of them doesn't make them similar at all. And it's disgraceful of Alex to, to play it that way. So let's let him say more about it.

And Odinga did it for two months, and they gave him the prime ministership created a new level of government, basically co president, and did the Muslims, the radical Islamist to stop then now they started attacking malls, police stations, all of it.

And she's so focused during the interview about tourism, that they have no idea and then there's the cameraman if you're listening and you don't want to. I guess he hadn't filed an EEOC thing on him. But I guess he deserves it. He is right. All right, guns are down, she's dead. And then turns the gun and shoots the cameraman. And they are going to sit there and hammer that and push that and promote that.

It's like a blurred screen. So at least they're not showing unedited raw footage, what have you. But the the startling lack of recognition of the humanity of these people that are being murdered and all he cares about his guns? Well, they're not human. It's nuts. It's absolutely nuts. To me. It was a moment when I was listening to this episode. I was like, I don't understand I don't understand this position. Because he he'll make the argument that the Liberals are you know, immediately calling for gun control and stuff like that. It's like you're immediately politicizing this to what do you what do you what's your problem? i It's terrifying to me as a psychopath. Now his statistics about gun violence are completely lies. Complete lies. One of the interesting things that you can dig up is the FBI did a study. And they found that there were 160 incidents of active gun mass shootings from 2000 to 2013. That's design defined as one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area. Similarly, a study found that there were 1052 incidents from 2013 to December 2 2015, where at least four people were shot but not necessarily killed. So if Alex wants to try and make the argument that mass shootings are down, and that gun violence isn't a real issue, the numbers really don't support that. And if you want to blame all of it on big gangbangers and what have you that will ring out and resonate with your incredibly wide audience white? Yeah, white on Yeah, because of gangbangers,

Because I've the first time I took mushrooms, I was laying around smoking cigarettes. And I was like, I can't I can't smoke cigarettes unless I defeat the cigarette. Because that's the way my brain works on these mushrooms rare and so I decided what I was going to do is I was going to only allow myself to smoke if I could take a cigarette in one drag. Like the entire secret. Wow. Like that would be conquering the cigarette because my body was stronger than the cigarette that makes sense. When you're wrong, you're not wrong. And so I tried to smoke like three cigarettes that way. I'm like, this is never gonna work. No, of course. So I changed the rules. And I was like, if I can withstand putting out a cigarette on my hand. Yeah, I will have conquered the cigarette through the strength of my being right. So I put a cigarette out on my hand. I was like, Well, that was dumb. And then my breath because I was high on mushrooms. I was like, onto something else.

If we don't expose the fact that this was racially motivated, and all part of the race war hype coming out of the White House, we will be collectively blamed for this, who and that's why I get so angry. When I am sick of being blamed for what somebody else does. If some white guy goes and kills nine black people, I didn't do it. And if some black guy goes and shoots to white people, black people didn't do that either. But the folks that are hyping Get up collectively that when a black person kills a white person, or a black person kills a white person, vice versa, that it's the group's fault. Well, yeah, I mean, if you're part of ISIS, and ISIS goes around killing people, you share responsibility. But if I'm part of a racial ethnic group, and someone in my quote group does something, they're their own person. And I know our audience gets that. But we have to explain this to all the leftist followers who really mean well, but have bought into the guilt as children, that they've done something wrong. And separately, the minorities then get a chip on their shoulder, some of them and their whole world is through those goggles through that distortion, that everybody's out to get them. I mean, if you go work somewhere, and you act like people are out to get you, you're gonna have a big problem. If you just are optimistic, have a good attitude, nine times out of 10. Even if you're working with a bunch of jerks, you'll end up being successful. And that's what it comes down to. I mean, I've run into plenty of racists in my life against white people, I just laugh about it.

Oh, that's not good in the event of a massive terrorist attack or a natural disaster. They're not laying the groundwork for the the government coming in and interning dissidents or anything like that. They're just talking about applications of when military operation would be appropriate within the boundaries of the United States. Right. And in cases of massive terrorist attacks.

And it all it still was kind of chaos because they, they didn't have firm groundwork in place like a lot of this stuff that's in this field manual. Wasn't there, right at the point of Hurricane Katrina? Yeah, so they didn't have as many. So here we go. This is this is from an article about this field manual. The Field Manual also broadly discusses a variety of psychological operations for use in managing detainees, including identifying malcontents, trained agitators, and political leaders in detainees communities in order to remove or reduce antagonistic attitudes. passages like these reflect lessons learned from the operation of internment facilities in Iraq, where psychological operations officers performed an intelligence function in managing camps that held as many as 1010s of 1000s of detainees at their peak at the beginning of the Iraq War. And even through the 2008 surge. There were few guidelines and regulations to help soldiers conduct these massive detention operations. According to a former military officer who conducted detainee operations in internment facilities in Iraq, quote, I would have loved to have this field manual five years ago, he said, the vast majority of guidance in the manual is intended for use in foreign theaters. He said, noting that only a handful of paragraphs from the 326 page manual address domestic operations of any kind. An army spokesman, speaking on background, said that the current spate of online postings have taken passages from the manual significantly out of context, conflating wartime operational guidance, such as the psychological operations with peacetime operations in which a limited number of the manuals principles would be applied in US soil in exceptional cases, such as during relief efforts, such as after Hurricane Katrina. Right. So the problem is that if you if you really take what's said in this manual, it's not that scary. It's not really it's certainly not a blueprint for interning US citizens,
