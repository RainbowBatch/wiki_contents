[[File:Jerome Corsi.jpg|thumb|Jerome Corsi]]
Corsi contributes to right-wing websites such as ''WorldNetDaily'' and ''Human Events'' and ''InfoWars.''  His "expertise" is in various conspiracies ranging from the North American Union government; the "birther" claims that President Barack Obama is not a United States citizen; criticism of the United States covering up information about September 11, and alleged United States support of Iran's nuclear program.

In 2017, he became the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the ''InfoWars'' but no longer works there.

Dan is vehement in his hatred of Corsi.  Dan will unleash on Jerome with anger that listeners rarely get to hear.
