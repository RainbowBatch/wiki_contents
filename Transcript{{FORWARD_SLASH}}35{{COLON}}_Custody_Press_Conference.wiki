Yeah, but the propaganda skills that he has, as I as I argued in our last episode that, you know, even if he gets destroyed by Chobani, it might be a good thing for him. You can see here he's making an argument that his audience will like, yes, it will appeal to them because they're not engaging with, you know, the reality of what's going on. He's really good at that. He is a propagandist spin artist. And so when he's out on the street, talking to people who I don't really think are actual reporters, okay. It's really easy for him to win. He can't win in court, but he can win on the street. You win on a verbal street fight as it were. Yes. And that's why it's fucking dangerous to play games with him. Yeah. Formal education.

Because if someone was a Hillary supporter, they would unfavorably bias them against it. And if you were anti Hillary, it would bias you in favor. Right? So I think that's right.

They didn't she didn't let them play really, or at least not the extent of them that we might think is relevant. Right? So sure, that's what he's trying to say. But again, not answering the question.

And he sunk the Lusitania and the Titanic. And he shot Lincoln, you know, at the Ford theater. And, you know, Alex Jones Rob Fort Knox. Yeah, but who's poisoned George Washington. You know, Alex Jones did this all shows is that, but the great news is, mainstream media is so discredited. That the more that is the great listeners and so great news. Yes. So it's good to you. It's quite a paradox. But in little, you know, nested areas of followers, like here in Austin, Texas, you know, it's pretty clear that the government worship, let me tell you, the government loving corporate worship system, the fake liberal system still has, still has its tentacles, you know, growing and doing well.

And it'll never have to deal with like, at no one will even remember that he lied to them about this, right? It's fucking very frustrating. Yeah, very frustrating.

The idea of like people having to make sense of randomness. Yeah. You come up with whatever explanation you come up with. Yeah. And, and the random chance of life? No, it's the Jews, obviously. Or the globalists, as it were. Yeah. And so once you have that mind, virus in your brain, getting rid of it creates a vacuum, it creates a gap where now the world doesn't make sense. And that's really scary for people. So I think a lot of the time you're used to having that crutch there, even though the crutch is actually hurting you. Yeah, digging into your shoulder, up here. Here we go. So there was this guy back in Columbia, Missouri, who used to come into the liquor store, my brother worked at all the time. He was this younger guy, maybe like 40 or so. And he always was in a wheelchair. And the story that we came to learn over the course of time, was that he was kind of like, as I recall, he was a scam artist, kind of trying to get disability stuff. Okay. And so he was on his side right now, he was going around in a wheelchair for a really long time when he didn't need to be in a wheelchair. All right. And so like and where this is going, Well, the thing is, because he stayed in a wheelchair for a really long time. A lot of his muscles atrophied. And he got to the point where he needed to be in the wheelchair. Ironic come up in exactly. And so he was so good. He was a drunk who put himself into a wheelchair by scamming a wheelchair. Yeah, fraud thing. So Alex Jones is listeners have that intellectual wheelchair. They don't need to be in the wheelchair. But they think it's easier to go through life with that wheelchair rolling around than it is to walk. Right? And they don't realize you do this too long. You won't be able to get out of it. You won't you just you'll never give up that wheelchair, metaphorically, and you'll stay in it such
