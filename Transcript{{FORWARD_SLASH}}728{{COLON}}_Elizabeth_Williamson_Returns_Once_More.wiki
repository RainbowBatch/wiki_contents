    | text      = And plus, if you are a disreputable assassin, let's say, why wouldn't you do a reputable? Well, I was trying to juxtapose it with a reputable news organization. You camouflage? It also, I think it makes total sense for Alex to believe that because it's it plays into his like importance.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson
    | timestamp = 07:57
    | text      = Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You could trick him. I don't think anyone if people couldn't be bothered to turn up to support them in court, I'm not sure they could be bothered to turn up to do whatever he was afraid they might do. So
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 08:10
    | text      = yeah, actually, that brings up a question that I was meaning to ask you. Elizabeth, not Dan. I was wondering about those press conferences, because I like not to poison the answer. But I find them really, really gross and disgusting. So how do you feel about the fact that like, no matter what you do, like you could choose not to do one of those. But there will be other news organizations there. Right, no matter what you do. So you might as well be there. But like, how do you feel about the actual event that happens? Filthy, filthy. That's, that's good answer.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson
    | timestamp = 08:53
    | text      = Yeah, no, I, I have I actually had this very conversation with another journalist in the elevator. deciding not to do one of his press conferences, because the other thing, you know, he did one yesterday where he did it at the lunch break, but he was late showing up. And so by the time he started talking, it was almost time for court to begin again. And so there you're really faced with, you know, the thing that you're absolutely talking about Jordan, which is, do I go into the courtroom and listen to the Sandy Hook families tell their story? Or do I sit here, outside stand here and just listen to this word salad of, you know, repetition that he you know, I mean, we've we've all heard it before 1000s of times, you know, do we just listen to Alex Jones bloviate and you know, deliver what he usually delivers or do you go inside and actually, you know, rejoin the real world Oh,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 10:00
    | text      = yeah, so one of the things that I think is really tough about that that choice that Alex put everyone in by showing up late and having a press conference is that the press conference itself is a disrespect to the what's going on in court. And then it's forcing people to make this choice between like, watching him disrespects the court or go into the court. I know that we were watching it, and the law and crime stream was showing the Alex outside and I'm like, we got a minute left. What are they going to do? Are they cut away from him to go?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson
    | timestamp = 10:33
    | text      = Yeah, that's their dilemma, right? Because typically, it's just one guy. And yeah, and thanks, Dan, because I was gonna make that point too, before Room Service came, of course. And that's that, you know, this whole thing is, this is, as Neil Heslin put it, in Austin, at the trial you attended. It is an act of cowardice that Alex Jones does not show up in the courtroom for his own trial, unless he is compelled to because he has to testify. So this trial has been going on now for nearly two weeks. And this is the first day he has shown up. But he's been in town for a couple of days. And he's had these press conferences out in front. And even when he's not in town, he's watching every day on his show. And he's, you know, maligning the process the judge the proceedings, and setting up a website, as they said in court today, kangaroo court where his viewers can watch and donate to his legal defense. So, you know, it just is, you know, after the last trial, one of the jurors, it was shared with me, said that his failure to turn up and the fact that he was tearing apart the entire process on his show, really pissed off the jurors because it said that he has utter contempt for the judicial process in this country. And that's really what got him where he is today. Right? It's
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 12:09
    | text      = such a compelling case for why you got default. Oh, really?
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 12:15
    | text      = Yeah, it is good to get this information from you. Just because it's like, while I was watching the trial in Austin, sitting in the courtroom, looking at the jurors, you know, kind of getting an idea of how it is they were feeling, you know, there's they had good poker face. Oh, totally. But you know, there were some of those moments, like the one that we'll always remember is the guy who is writing notes for the first hour or two of Alex's testimony, just putting his notepad down. Like, you know what, there's no reason to keep doing that. I get it. Yeah, exactly. But it's it's nice to know that that is disrespectful behavior that they do account for, because there is a part of me that's like, I don't know if they would care about
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 12:59
    | text      = it. Think about it, too, that these are people who are taking time out of their lives to do a civic duty. Totally. And it probably would be an affront to the sacrifice that they're making. Absolutely. Just yeah,
}}

    | timestamp = 13:14
    | text      = Yes, exactly. Rather than collecting my you know, per diem and yeah, no. And as you recall, in Austin, he was maligning the jury themselves, right. He was calling them you know, basically dead vocals. Yeah.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 13:39
    | text      = I will I will say one fun thing about his press conferences up front was I was actually on the phone with you, Elizabeth. And we were discussing something. Some I think it was something about the story about his bankruptcy court. And I could just hear him in the background starting to talk. And we rushed off the phone. And on the stream. I saw you walk behind

    | text      = Yes. He he recast? You know what was really a pretty devastating hearing for him earlier this week, as Oh, that's exactly what if we wanted a bankruptcy judge in Texas to remove my lawyer and my chief restructuring officer, because that means we'll get additional oversight over free speech systems that we just so dearly need and by someone who is completely unaffiliated, unlike the lawyer and the chief restructuring officer who were removed, someone who is completely unrelated to freeze Ah systems Imagine that. Yeah. So, yeah,
}}

    | text      = I'd say maybe there is something to this for the for free speech system is because based on pause and Alex's testimony, I don't know if anybody knows how that business actually works or where money comes from money work, you're being so naive. So it'll be nice for somebody to finally know what's actually going on. There's such a thing as strategic unawareness that might be possible deniability, what kind of what kind of two words are those to put next to each other? That's confused, absurd,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Elizabeth Williamson
    | timestamp = 16:12
    | text      = was the thing that I also liked another sort of meta aspect of this whole thing is, so one of the things that the bankruptcy judge raised as a lack of candor, a lack of transparency and a questionable business expense or personal expense, actually by Jones was the $80,000 that he pulled out of the company to finance his trip here in Connecticut, where he has a cadre of bodyguards. He said in court today that he took a charter jet to Waterbury, Connecticut, and rolls up in a fleet of SUVs and is staying at a pretty posh air b&b, a short distance from the courthouse so it doesn't seem like bankrupt behavior

And as the judge pointed out, you are objecting to things your client is saying. Which is actually a good thing when your client is Alex Jones. You know, you can't it's complete violation of the rules. Yeah, so she was so she was saying, What are you doing norm? You know, you're basically objet, your your, your your objections. First of all, your client is ignoring you. So, you know, when when your own lawyer objects, you stop talking and you wait for a ruling because chances are you're not going to have to answer the question, right? Not Steve just kept talking. It didn't matter if norm was objecting, it didn't matter if norms objections were sustained, which meant that Alex wouldn't have to answer the question. I was just kept rolling, because what he was doing was looking for an opportunity to break the rules against making this a political kind of trial. He's not supposed to talk about electoral politics, presidential politics, or political figures. He's not supposed to make this partisan thing. He was absolutely looking for every opportunity to slip that in there. He's not supposed to talk about his first amendment rights. He's not supposed to talk about his bankruptcy. He's got a lot of you know, you use the term handcuffs. He's got a lot handcuffs on him. Yeah. Shine bust through all of them. So that was all he was looking for. And then Norman was just sort of, you know, I'm going to show Alex that I'm objecting objecting objecting family's lawyers going after him. So it just got to the point where he was just shouting, objection. Any, you know, if you would have stopped him and said, What are you objecting to?

He wants to bring that up, because, of course, his false theory of the case is that the this is an effort by the deep state and the Democrats and all of his political enemies to silence him. This is not about, you know, the abuse these families have been subjected to because of his years worth of lying about Sandy Hook. No, it has to be, you know, a persecution thing. So that's one. And second, I think, and because norm is doing it to a he knows Alex is watching him on TV. So he is, you know, performing for his client.

And, in my mind, what I'm seeing him do is like, we've seen politics override everybody's thoughts to the point where sometimes, you know, you see people say absolutely insane shit, just because it's like, I'm, I'm with this team. I'm with the Republican team, you know, it would make sense that he would think you know, if I can get a couple of these conservatives to completely remove any and all independent thought, which is possible, then maybe he can get out of it.

Yeah, Alex had Matthew Mills on his show, who is the guy who it was the 2014 Super Bowl, I believe, yeah. Right after he interrupted the MVP press conference and yelled about oh, 911 was an inside job. And so Alex had him on the show. And it was like, You're the best. You're so great. I love you. I gotta give you a job. You're my soldier, or, you know, whatever. Yeah, we're either very enthusiastic about him. And Alex had to own all that. And then it's revealed that he, Matthew Mills, was arrested later for harassing the Soto family members at their charity. 5k Yeah. The reason I think this is so critical is that it draws this straight line between Alex endorsing, offering to hire congratulating this person who is doing essentially.

You know, Jones said, and they played that clip, you know, I've got some other disruption, I want it and I'm paraphrasing here, but I've got some other disruption. I want to talk to you about offline. And this, you know, this disruption of the 5k came after that. So whether it was exactly that or not. And of course, Jones said it wasn't. It does, as you say, Dan, draw that line. And, you know, one of the challenges here for the lawyers in this particular case, is that very few of these plaintiffs have been named by Alex Jones on the show. And it's harder to draw that direct line. So this I thought, I agree, this was really kind of a revelation. I didn't know he had had that guy on celebrated him. And then he went on to disrupt that event for Vickie Soto, the teacher who was killed at Sandy Hook. Yeah.
