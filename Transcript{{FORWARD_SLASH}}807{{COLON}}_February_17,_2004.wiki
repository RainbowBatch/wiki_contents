One of the things that I've noticed about it is that it is very you know, there's a lot of similarities to Breath of the Wild. Oh, yeah. And I think that's a good thing. Yeah. Because I think what people liked was that game. Yeah. And if you just gave us more of that, but more complicated, and like sort of evolved the game a bit. Yeah. Who's complaining about that?

But everything that I've encountered so far has been pretty fun. Even the things that I like I was telling you before we got started, I wandered into a cave, and just got wrecked by some enemies that I should not have gone anywhere near even. That was fun. Yeah, multiple times. I've said Ah. I gotta run away. Oh, no, fuck, it's a Lionel run. It's a lot of fun. It's definitely going to be a bright spot for a bit nice. Yeah, I was wrong to you were wrong. Well, I I had said that the lead up to this game release was something I wasn't excited about. Because it felt kind of like another Breath of the Wild. You did. And I had entered with that those feelings and I was wrong. It's it's far surpassed the expectations that I had. So far.

    | text      = Yeah. So, um, today, Jordan, we have an episode to go, oh, yeah, there's a little bit of business to cover here at the top of the show, though. So first order of business. I guess we're recording this. I'm not entirely sure how the audio is gonna sound on this, because we tried to get some new equipment because we've had some sound issues. I'm sure some people have noticed them, there's been a little bit of crackling and then it didn't come through in the recording. But periodically, our headphones would sort of frazzle out. And so we tried to replace a number of things and then spent three hours three hours later to get where we are. And now we're here. And we have reverted back to most of the old equipment, except with the headphone amp replace. Yes. And so it seems to be working. But I don't know exactly. Like if we have the levels dialed in and everything so so hopefully, everything will sound good, and what have you, but I'm just saying this in advance, if there's some scariness that's why and we'll get it sorted out as we move forward. The

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:06:27.000
    | text      = The alternative was just to say we're punting. There's no episode. Yeah, fucking Not gonna happen. So there's that. Yeah. Second little piece of business. I decided to stay in the past. And so we're going to be talking about February 17 2004. Cool. And there's a couple of reasons. All right. The first was our last 2004 episode was a cliffhanger. True, because Alex was going to watch Mel Gibson on Diane Sawyer show. And then he was going to reveal whether or not they cut out the cool things that Mel Gibson said Yeah, but no, if we had waited too long, this cliffhanger now it would have no power. So that's one reason obviously storytelling. This is more or less a rationalization. Don't worry about it. This week was there was the shooting in Texas. Yeah, at the mall. Yeah. And so I was watching Alex's content, intending to cover the course. But I found it to be disgusting. Yeah. He gratuitously played the videos of people dead on the ground. And All right, well, no blood everywhere. And you know, because they're there. I didn't see them on Twitter. But I heard from a number of people that like very graphic photos and videos and stuff were circulating on social media and these were the things that Alex was playing and it was horrific. Holy shit. And, you know, his his narrative around it really isn't anything new. Yeah. But the the potency of it the emotional manipulation that was going into it. Just I don't I don't even feel like it's something that can be covered. It just has to be like mentioned and condemned. Yeah, I can't cover him playing I don't know faces of death. No, I mean, no on his show, like that's disgusting.

And I didn't think it could be made into an episode. All that was anything other than kind of

    | text      = And I felt like in the opposite direction. Our last episode we talked to Erica Lafferty was a very emotional episode for a lot of people you know there was a lot of feelings the you know are brought up of many of them positive many of them you know reflective of the ability for someone to persevere and I didn't necessarily want to super heavy episodes on one two punch. So there's a lot of reasons why I was like fuck this noise. Yeah, but I will say I think the main one is his Gore I mean obsession you

    | text      = so I watched this hour long interview that Sawyer did with Mel Gibson, and it's about what you'd expect. She's asking him questions about the movie and then he has some. She has some religious experts on to discuss some of the reasons that people are concerned about the film, the head of the ADL is interviewed and he explicitly says that he doesn't think Gibson is anti semitic, nor is the film necessarily anti semitic, but it has the potential to inflame anti semitic feelings, particularly surrounding the idea that Jewish people, including those alive today bear responsibility for killing Jesus. Gibson does also directly say that he believes there's a conspiracy all around us without specifically naming the New World Order. He gets really pissed off when Diane Sawyer brings up how his dad's a Holocaust denier though, and his answers are not super helpful when she asks for clarification about metals feelings, but whether or not his movie is divinely inspired. Yeah, very weird. Yeah,

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:15:17.000
    | text      = Right? And I'm embarrassed because his dad is such does not mean he is true. It's cause for concern at little bit. I mean, but, you know, there's Abraham Foxman, the head of the ADL at this point is being very generous, being quite, quite fair with his press very, very generous. So overall, this wasn't great. But it also wasn't too bad. It helps provide some explanation for the reasons that some groups were offended by various aspects of the movie, while at the same time, it doesn't hold Mel's feet to the fire about how his dad's a giant anti Semite who hates the Catholic church because they reject the idea that Jews are guilty of deicide. And how his new movie really gives the impression that Jews are guilty of deicide. So you're really let that line of inquiry dropped pretty easily. And I think that could have been pressed on a little bit more. Because, you know, just because your dad has a noxious belief doesn't mean that you do as well, right? However, when your dad's horrible, really, noxious belief is tied to some religious belief, and you share that religious belief. It leads to the question of do you also share that noxious belief that is connected to your dad's religious belief which you do share? Right? That's, that's, I would have liked a little bit more assessment of that. But he gets so mad. Oh, and she's asking about his dad. Diane. Got it. Got to drop it.

And my wife had taped primetime with Diane Sawyer for me because Mel Gibson was on the show. And I wanted to see what they tried to say about the passion and what his response was. And my wife had just let the the tape run. So I had two hours of shows on there. And so I just hit rewind and sat down and started. Did we need that detail waiting for it to conclude, it's rewinding. And I got impatient and hit play. And it stopped on Abraham Foxman of the anti Defamation League, which is really the Defamation League of freedom. And it stopped on Intel and s and saying how scary the film was, and how scary it was that these Christians were crying and everybody was so silent after he snuck into a screening of it and Mrs. CEFR, Diane Sawyer said to him, she said, Well, is Mel Gibson, anti semitic? Is his film anti semitic. And he said, No, it's not, but it's still dangerous. The point that

And it's very hard to sit through something like that and not have it make some kind of impact. When there's a discussion of the movie being scary. It's because of the history of passion plays and how they've been used in the past to target Jewish populations. One of the experts they talked to also made the point that there are aspects of how things are presented in the movie that will be experienced very differently by a viewer who has experience of being called things like Christ killer. Yeah. Do you got to understand where people are coming from right. Oh, little.

And that when they quote interview Jews and they see a cross, they feel threatened and that it's you know, This bad symbol and that's ridiculous. Also, Mrs. Council on Foreign Relations, Diane Sawyer Mrs. anti gun. She's been caught, you know, putting out all these stilted and manipulated the news pieces. She said, Well what about Hitler? You know, he he said passion plays were very useful, you know show that Jews are bad and Mel Gibson came back with the best answer. He's so smart. He said Hitler was an occultist. Hitler was a devil worshiper. You know, that's what I say to people who call them to this show. And like Hitler, Hitler was horrible worshipper. That's your problem is part of a fool society. Hitler was part of the showing bones organizations that were founded in Germany. That's the facts. And 99% of people you talk to don't know that about Hitler. In fact, the ADL and other brands, what we don't know about an example of Christianity targeting Jews, and I resent that I resent them saying a devil worshiper represents Christians. Adolf Hitler was an occultist.

Alex is responding to a point that no one made because his ability to respond to this piece that all relies on that. Also, it's painfully obvious that Alex didn't watch the whole thing. He thinks they cut out Mel's WMDs Zinger. And all the specific things he's mentioning are all from around the same five minutes in the middle that he stopped at when he got impatient. With this VHS we want to say that's exactly right. That sounds exactly right. The reason that some Jewish people expressed a negative feeling towards seeing across is because of that history of being accused of deicide. And the atrocities that have been carried out against Jewish people using that accusation as justification. Like it's not something that is universal, but it's something that some Jewish people who were talked to, and you know, involved in responding to surveys,

I always like to imagine that he was a real hard worker in these earlier days when he got lazy later, right. He can't even be bothered to watch an hour long ABC interview before he spends a sizable chunk of his show complaining about it and using it to argue that the ADL is responsible for making anti semitism worse.

I don't get it. Like, this is more suspicious now. Like, wouldn't you have told him that sometime before right now and he's on air? How did he get impatient waiting for the tape to rewind if there was only like five minutes of the show recorded? None of this makes sense. I'd love to get to the bottom of this, but I suspect there's no hope. My guess is that someone at the office, maybe even his wife pointed out that he was completely wrong about the WMD joke. And now he has to try and cover his ass before callers confront him about it, which is what would happen. So he just comes up with this baffling story about his wife's recording.

And they were like, specifically targeting like evangelical churches and like religious groups, to it's a marketing plan. Yeah, that was the idea. Yeah. So great. Yeah. Anyway, Alex's entire angle on the stories that Abraham Foxman, the head of the ADL is doing an about face and this interview because Alex watched a couple of minutes where Foxman said that he doesn't think that Mel Gibson's anti semitic which is a turnaround. Alex believes that he's seen Foxman call Gibson and his movie anti semitic in the past so this is a softening of his position. In reality, Foxman hadn't said those things but Alex constructed narratives were criticism of Gibson, and the plans for this movie were reported as attacks on Gibson and accusations that he's anti semitic. Right? Alex has built a storyline out of his fantasies that does not really connect to reality. Foxman and plenty of other religious experts were very concerned about how the plan that Gibson had for this movie would turn out Gibson's dad was no secret. Nor was the fact that Mel himself was a member of the breakaway branch of Catholicism that denies the Vatican's legitimacy since the second Council. There is a way that this story could be brought to the screen in a responsible way. And there's a way that seemed more like what someone like Mel Gibson might do. And many right thinking people were worried about that and voiced that concern to Alex, that was them calling Gibson anti semitic, which, ironically, is accurate, but isn't what they were saying, right, Foxman as well as a lot of other folks from many different religious groups were able to read the script in advance. And they were super concerned that it seemed like the movie was setting out to make the Jewish people, the primary antagonists in the film, with the Romans just kind of being there and having their hands tied by Jewish influence.

That line was cut from the film and an associate of Gibson told The New York Times, quote, it didn't work in the focus screenings, maybe it was thought to be too hurtful or taken, not in the way that it was intended. It has been used terribly over the years. It's kind of fun that Mel Gibson was so obsessed with the pointing out that you know, is making the most accurate portrayal of the passion.

Oh, and so like, there's also kind of anti semitic leanings on shamrocks part Sure, sure, sure. Anyway, one thing that Foxman did say was quote, not in the interview with Sawyer this is something that he had said previously right. He said quote, recent statements by Mel Gibson paint the portrait of an anti Semite.

Peter Boyle of the New York, the New Yorker, went to a rough cut screening of the passion and then spent some time with Mel. And some of the stuff he was saying wasn't great. For instance, Gibson was talking about the that cutscene of kFS and said, quote, I wanted it in my brother said, I was wimping out. If I didn't include it, it happened. It was said, but man, if I included it in there, they'd be coming after me at my house, they'd kill me. Boyle makes it very clear in the article that they Gibson was referring to are the people at the ABL and Simon Wiesenthal Center who had criticized him previously. Yeah, that's right. At another point Gibson got mad that someone on CNN mentioned his father and said, quote, I don't want to be dissing my father. He never denied the Holocaust. He just said there were fewer than 6 million. I don't want to have them dissing my father. I mean, he's my father. I don't know about you.

And the woman's husband jumped over the bleachers and ran up to the black man and the black man called him a racial name. This was in the newspaper. And we had him on the show and the white man called him a racial name back. And he was arrested for the racial term. And the black man wasn't arrested for assaulting the woman.

That's what I'm okay. So in the real world, this guy wasn't a coach that is involved. It was actually a referee at a high school football game. The woman in question was a reporter named Kimberly Ray, who was trying to take pictures of the referees specifically because she thought they had decided the outcome of the game. And one of the teams wasn't going to go to state because of it. Right. She told ABC, quote, a lot of penalties were called throughout the game, and I decided I was going to include that perspective in my stories. So she felt that there were a lot of penalties in this high school football game and decided that her reporting was going to reflect that. She tried to take pictures of the reps after the game was over. While they were leaving to the locker room. She was asked not to take their picture. And according to her, she stopped and was going to leave when one of them grabbed her camera and tried to wrestle it from her. She yelled for her husband who came to her defense. The ref put up his hands and said, according to the husband, I ain't touched her. This is like I said, it's a story that's coming from her husband, Lonnie Ray. Sure. So it no point in his telling of it to ABC. Did the referee call him any racist names, right? That did not happen in his telling of the story, right. However, he immediately stormed towards the locker room and found the county commissioner there, which should give you a sense of how small of a town we're talking about. So Lonnie told ABC that he said to the county commissioner, you bring that an up here, I want to kick his fucking ass. And it wasn't at an end. No, I
