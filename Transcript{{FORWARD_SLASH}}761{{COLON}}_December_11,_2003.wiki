This was followed up by another bomb that went off in Monacan. At this point, in 2003, former Irish Supreme Court Judge Henry Barron was preparing to release a report detailing an investigation into British intelligence involvement in the troubles. And one of the things that was a big takeaway was that British intelligence likely colluded with loyalist terrorists in the carrying out of these bombings.

    | text      = I was poking around and then I found an article on a Christian blog and it started to come into focus. Apparently this story about Kent comes from a book by David Limbaugh titled "Persecution: How Liberals are Waging War Against Christianity." According to this book, Kent made the proclamation in May 1995. Alex is reporting this as a presents day story because he's probably just seen blogs that are repeating this thing that was published in Limbaugh's book which came out In August 2003. So Alex is probably, like, he thinks that this is the thing that just happened and that's because of lazy opportunistic reporting that goes on and sensational-ass right-wing victimization blogs. This claim is reported all over apocalyptic Christian media and it's told differently in different venues. For instance, it's often reported as a threat about a graduation in the outlets that want to appear more news-like. John Hagee, a doomsday preacher wrote about Kent in his book: "Can America Survive? 10 Prophetic Signs", we are the terminal generation. And it hits a little different as the kids say. For one thing, it isn't about a graduation ceremony anymore. This time it's about anybody praying in school.

    | text      = It is true that seven of the nine justices are appointed by Republican presidents who were just simply somehow cheated or misled by the by the people they appointed. For example, Ronald Reagan appointed Sandra O'Connor. And he made the mistake and during his campaign of saying he was going to appoint a woman, and then she was the only woman he was shown. And my guess is he said to her, Sandra, of course, you're pro life, aren't you? And she said, Of course, Mr. President, and then she went right ahead, took the appointment and has demonstrated her feminist leanings ever since. And it's too bad how they were misled.
