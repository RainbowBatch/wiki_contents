    | text      = So this has to do with a trio of bombs that were detonated in Dublin on May 17 1974, ultimately killing 26 and injuring hundreds more. This was followed up by another bomb that went off in Monacan. At this point, in 2003, former Irish Supreme Court Judge Henry Barron was preparing to release a report detailing an investigation into British intelligence involvement in the troubles. And one of the things that was a big takeaway was that British intelligence likely colluded with loyalist terrorists in the carrying out of these bombings, oh, everyone is shocked. This is awful. But even the underlying report that Alex is using, as he sort of stopped short of saying that it can be proven. Alex is very uncertain and on careful about detail, right, right. Another detail that Alex is getting wrong is that he's saying that these bombings that British intelligence is suspected of involvement in happened in Northern Ireland. The two cities that they occurred in are both in Ireland. Yeah, this is a pretty critical detail when you consider the dynamics of Alex's ideas about false flags and all of that, but he just gets it wrong. And then it's established and he moves on.

    | text      = Well see, here's the thing. Well, I was poking around and then I found an article on a Christian blog and it started to come into focus. Apparently this story about Kent comes from a book by David Limbaugh titled persecution, how liberals are waging war against Christianity. According to this book, Kent made the proclamation in May 1995. Alex is reporting this as he presents a story because he's probably just seen blogs that are repeating this thing that was published in limbaugh's book which came out In August 2003, so Alex is probably like he thinks that this is the thing that just happened and that's because of lazy right opportunistic reporting that goes on and sensational last right? Right Wing victimization blogs. This claim is reported all over apocalyptic Christian media and it's told differently in different venues. For instance, it's often reported as a threat about a graduation in the outlets that want to appear more news like John Hagee doomsday preacher wrote about Kenton his book, can America survive 10 prophetic signs, we are the terminal generation. And it hits a little different as the kids say, for one thing, it isn't about a graduation ceremony anymore. This time it's about anybody praying in school. Oh my god. And it also seems a bit more severe. Quote, anyone who thinks I'm kidding about this better think again, anyone who violates these orders is going to wish that he or she had died as a child when this court gets through with it.

Okay. in Galveston, Texas, a lawyer representing four students brought a suit against the school system because they had formal prayers read before graduation ceremonies, and before every home football game, and because folks also they routinely would hand out Bibles on school grounds, right. So these four students brought a class action suit against the school district. Yeah, I'm on their team. I can find no concrete evidence that can't ever said anything about people who said Jesus, wishing they hadn't been born. But this case did eventually make it all the way to the Supreme Court in Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe, where the court ruled that these prayers, even if they were written and delivered by students constituted policy of the school and therefore broke the Establishment Clause.

But like, this is exactly what would happen based on the way Alex is primed the audio totally anybody who's supporting Bush is up to something, or they're not ideologically pure enough, whereas Phyllis Schlafly has been a major part of building the extreme right wing, right that Alex and his audience get to enjoy at this point. Now at the same time, she's also savvy enough to understand that like, alright, there is a need for me to work within some structures and pursue these policy goals at the point when there is a possibility of getting the past these pipe dream nonsense things about Ron Paul ever even making it out of the primary, right? It's not gonna fly. And they don't respect that they have no respect for the fact that she's like, gets shit done.
