On this episode, Dan reports back to Jordan about some research he was inspired to do after listening to some of Alex Jones' special reports, filed while he was on the road.  Topics covered include:

*What do statistics really look like for Infowars?
*How many radio stations in Kane, PA is Alex broadcast on?
*Does Alex hate that he is being forced to talk about pee?
*Should Alex give it all up and become a stand up comic?

A couple citations for the research done:
