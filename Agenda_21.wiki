'''Agenda 21''' is a non-binding action plan developed by the [[United Nations]] in 1992, which outlines sustainable development goals for the 21st century<ref>https://extremismterms.adl.org/glossary/agenda-21</ref>. It aims to address global environmental, social, and economic challenges by promoting sustainable practices in areas such as energy, transportation, and agriculture. However, the plan has been intentionally misinterpreted and misrepresented by far-right propagandists like [[Alex Jones]] who claim that it is a nefarious plot to establish a [[one-world government]] and deprive people of their property rights and personal freedoms.

These claims are baseless, as Agenda 21 is a voluntary action plan that encourages cooperation and collaboration among nations to achieve sustainable development goals. The misinterpretation of Agenda 21 has been used as a tool to stoke fears and promote conspiracy theories, particularly in the United States, where some local governments have even passed resolutions opposing the plan based on false information.
