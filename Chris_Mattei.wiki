'''Chris Mattei''' is a lawyer who represented [[Sandy Hook Family Members|several families of the victims of Sandy Hook]] in a [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|defamation case against Alex Jones in Connecticut]].

== Threats against Mattei ==

Jones once tried to place a million dollar bounty on Mattei, and was sanctioned by the court because of it.

Jones was upset that Mattei's firm had found child pornography among the emails Free Speech Systems provided during discovery. There was no evidence that Jones was aware of the material, and it was likely sent to Jones by some sick person trying to get FSS in trouble. It should be clear however, that there is absolutely no evidence that Mattei or anyone related to the sandy hook plaintiffs was involved.
