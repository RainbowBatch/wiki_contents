'''Harrison Smith''' is a D-List on-air personality at [[InfoWars]]. He's even less notable and talented than [[Owen Shroyer]], which is saying something.

Harrison is somewhat notable for being saddled with hosting [[The American Journal]], after [[Alex Jones]] freed up the slot by firing [[David Knight]]. Because both Alex and Owen were in DC for the [[January 6th Insurrection]], it was Harrison who hosted InfoWars on January 6th, leading to some hilariously inept coverage in one of the US's darkest hours.
