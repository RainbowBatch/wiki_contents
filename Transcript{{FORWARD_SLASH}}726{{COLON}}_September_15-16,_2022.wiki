So Ron DeSantis, should be in prison for this stuff that he's pulled, which Alex is fully in favor of, because he has an opposition to immigration DeSantis charter two flights and sent immigrants to Martha's Vineyard specifically, because it's an area that's a symbol of rich liberal elites, you can see how that shorthand is very clear in the way that Alex describes the place. If that all wasn't bad enough, the immigrants were lied to. When they were about where they weren't going. Right. One of them told reporters quote, when we got on the plane, they told us they would give us jobs a place to live everything. Another said quote, I simply feel misled because they told a lie, and it has come to nothing. According to Domingo Garcia, the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the people who are who were being used as political props were even given fake documents that were meant to fool them into thinking that there was a more official backing to the idea that jobs and housing were waiting for them. Interestingly, According to NPR, these flights were paid for by DeSantis but originated in Texas which does seem to imply some level of fucked up coordination between him and Texas Governor Abbott or else I guess maybe is this an urge state kidnapping?

Quote the migrant said a woman they identified as Perla approached them outside the shelter and lured them into boarding the plane saying that they would be flown to Boston where they could get expedited workpapers She provided them with food. The migrant said Perla was trying to recruit more passengers just hours before their flight. In addition to all this horrific bullshit, they didn't inform the folks doing this transportation to these migrants didn't inform officials in Martha's Vineyard of the people's arrival specifically, so they could be caught off guard and chaos would be more likely because that's the goal here. Sure. This is an unacceptable and debased level of political theater where we need to stop as a country and recognize that things have just gotten too far. And the things that we're accepting are really far past what's decent. The fact that the organizers of this stunt which involves fraud, potential human trafficking, and possibly some other crimes have the fact that they haven't been arrested already is a fucking bummer. Yeah, that's insane. The game that's being played here is really simple. Ron DeSantis wanted to send immigrants to liberal areas because he hates immigrants. And he thinks that liberals are all talk when it comes to supporting immigration. Unfortunately, if he were to inform officials in these liberal areas that immigrants were coming, they would be able to prepare and accommodate them, which wouldn't really cause any problems and there isn't propaganda value in that. However, if you don't tell officials, and you defraud the migrants with promises of housing and work, then you create a situation where the officials in the liberal area you're targeting are going to be outraged. They're not, they're gonna be super offended that you would do this to people and likely speak out against you for it, then you ignore their criticism about how what you did was fraud, and possibly human trafficking, and pretend they're just mad at you because you send immigrants to their pressure, their precious liberal enclave, you then sell that message to your audience to reinforce your narrative than in reality, no one wants immigrants around and liberals are just lying about it. Fuck this shit. Fuck these people. And fuck Alex and his inability to even be consistent on the one big thing he's supposed to be caring about so much. The king of human trafficking, corruption sniffing it out, man. He doesn't care about any of his principles.

From their key finding section, quote, The proximal origins of SARS Cove to remain unknown. There are two leading hypotheses that the virus emerged as a zoonotic spillover from wildlife or a farm animal possibly through a wet market in a location that is still undetermined, or that the virus emerged from a research related incident during the field collection of viruses or through a laboratory associated escape. Commissioners held diverse views about the relative probabilities of the two explanations, and both possibilities require further scientific investigation check.

He's reporting and hyping up instances of young people having medical conditions, but never actually does the work to connect them to the vaccine at all. That connection is already made in the minds of his listener. So it's kind of a waste of time to worry about actually demonstrating it. It seems like this never happens or can't happen. But high school athletes can have heart attacks, just do a little digging into the subject. And you can find instances pre COVID really easily. In fact, in 2011, Denver Public Schools began installing portable defibrillator is that schools because, quote, sudden cardiac arrest kills an estimated 300,000 Americans every year, including about 7000 children. Yeah, Alex's exploiting his audiences understandable feeling that young people shouldn't have heart attacks, and then weaponizing that for his anti Vax agenda, it's disgusting. And ultimately, he's using the deaths and medical emergencies of these young people as props for him to use to accumulate power and profit. Sort of like how Ron DeSantis is using,

And it deals with FedEx. And FedEx is seen as an absolutely key indicator. What's happening not just here but in the world economy. Now FedEx is telling the world what I've told you in the last month because I know people in industry, not just conservatives, not just nationalist, I know people in a lot of areas of infrastructure. And basically, the economy is flatlining when this has all been done, but done by design, as usual, here are some of the headlines. Massive FedEx shares plunge, the Dow Jones every other indices way down right now, that x shares plunge by 70% After company says it's going to get worse. We're going into a worldwide recession, FedEx CEO warns, numbers don't pretend very well.

    | text      = So there's some serious concerns with FedEx announcing that they're seeing a decrease in shipping both domestically and internationally. This could be a negative indicator for the economy in the future. But there's also a ton of other variables that play into this. One that's pointed to pretty frequently is that the Asian economy is weakening, and that impact is shown in reduced freight. Another variable is that people are starting to shop in person more now that most people are acting like COVID is over, that has the effect of reducing shipping to previously normal rates, which are lower than they have been over the course of the pandemic. Thirdly, Amazon has made moves into the logistics and transportation, transportation space in the past few years. And that has had the effect of reducing FedEx as overall market share. All that being said FedEx was down about 22%, which definitely isn't a good sign. However, if you look back at their stock price, over time, they're trading at about $161 A share as I was preparing this episode, in March 2020, they were at $106.63 A share before making a huge jump as the pandemic lead to more people ordering things for more delivery, right. And there were people ordering things that may be needed to be delivered immediately, you know, more tight timeframes, which does have an effect as that demand goes down, you still need to offer that delivery in that window that you're offering, right? Which leads to like, instead of a plane being 100%, full, you have to send it with like, half full, or whatever, that has a big impact. Yep, this may be a bad indicator of things to come. But it may not be a cause for an emergency episode and the theatrics that Alex is putting into this. That said, he does this all the time about everything. And it's always the summer of rage coming. And I'm not surprised at all. Yeah. But yeah, you know, there may be economic issues. Like you know, there may be some difficulties, FedEx might be in some trouble. But whatever it is, has nothing to do with is no connection to anything. Alex is saying.

And when she says that, eventually people need to leave. She's talking about how the shelter she works with isn't designed for providing long term help.

Not like the city, she's not speaking for the city, right or for Martha's Vineyard as a whole like it's, he's he's deceiving with the context. Yeah. So the larger context of that clip it Alex isn't playing. It's about how the community has come together to help these migrants.

This is how a distasteful prank show operates not a governor. Beyond that. What he's saying is bullshit. People are upset about migrants and refugees going to different cities. They were super offended by the way DeSantis is doing this as a political stunt using the safety of migrants as a prop. He's endangering you Humans, including children, for his own purposes, largely to increase the chances that he's able to increase his political power in the future. He knows well enough that he can't acknowledge that this is what he's getting pushback for. Because it's a very sensible push back that he can't just write off as triggered virtue signal responses.
