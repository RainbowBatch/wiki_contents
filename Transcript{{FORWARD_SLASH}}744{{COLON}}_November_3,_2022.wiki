I would bet that he did do some drugs during his time living with some San Francisco nudists, but that's a bit of a distance from a hallucinogen cult. Unless you're a member of Alex's audience, then you will actually believe that cities are burning and demons walk the streets of every urban center cackling and threatening any conservative who dares show their face.

It should be pointed out that she wasn't it Okay? Probably not. It should be pointed out that she wasn't a nudist activist in the 70s, which is kind of where your mind goes. It's closer to the 90s and early 2000s. She was a local character and actually has a ton in common with Alex, for instance, she was a huge 911 truther. She even had a public access show call about 911 called uncensored 911, which eventually became a show called my Naked Truth, where she would host a talk show naked. I guess Alex didn't do his show naked. But he got his start in public access. And he was super into 911 conspiracy. So him and Todd would probably have a lot to bond over. You may notice that Alex says that she's in jail for quote pedophile behavior. Yeah, that's typically this would be Alex using suggestive language to implant ideas in his audience's head. Sure. And this case, however, he just doesn't actually know any of the details of the case. But he feels like he heard something that was like, yeah, maybe it's pedophilic. But he wants to keep it vague, just in case right right to change things up. Yeah, he doesn't want to get lawsuit or nothing. Tom is in jail for stalking and harassing a former friend of her sons, who she sent messages expressing her love for and who she made actions towards attempting to kidnap. He was in the ninth grade at the time, and her actions are reprehensible. Wow, there's no indication that de Pape had any involvement with that stuff, though, because he and Tom split in 2015. And she has said that even at that point, he was less a romantic partner, and more of a roommate and someone who took care of the kids who may be his kids as well. It's reported that he's the father of her children, but this whole thing is chaotic. And I have no idea what's what right top married a 20 year old named James Smith in 2013. And de Pape and her last contract contact a little bit after that point. She told the San Francisco Chronicle that she assumed he'd quote completely lost his mind after that point. Tom does make some interesting points in as much as she felt that debate wasn't really a Trump guy or a right winger which might seem true to her on the surface. The nature of this conspiracy world that's so prominent now involves a denial about the actual political underpinning of the conspiracy beliefs that you hold, you may think that you're just opposed to the deep state cabal are something and have no connection at all to the ways that the conspiracy belief is used to invalidate and attack any kind of federal bureaucracy. Let's say, in your mind, you're against demons who drink children's blood, but the real world implications are of your belief serves only explicitly right wing political goals. You might notice that no one arrives at left leaning politics by obsessing about Soros or Klaus Schwab. And there's a reason for that. It's a dynamic that's built in you don't really, you know, you're not supposed to realize how all this conspiracy is geared towards funneling you towards a extreme right wing political set that you don't identify as extreme right.

    | text      = Alex is making shit up by the police report here. But this caller is confused because the media he's consuming is full of shit. Right? It would be confusing to imagine that Paul Pelosi could take the paper in a fight. But that isn't really relevant because they weren't fighting to paper wasn't there to attack or kill Paul, he was perfectly fine waiting around with him until Nancy returned. Paul didn't have to fight off to paper, which is why this situation really isn't that confusing, right? And he just doesn't get that right. Asking for evidence isn't the new conspiracy theory. But it is really fun that Cernovich is still a name that people like Alex say without feeling intense shame. What Cernovich is describing is the same old game that conspiracy theorists have always played. Essentially, it goes like this. There's an event that you desperately don't want people to accept as real because it's super threatening to your political project or propaganda business model. You don't really have any direct means of invalidating the event, and you can't really claim that it didn't happen. So what you do is you make a ridiculous demand and insist that it's suspicious that your demand isn't being met. The public has no right to the surveillance video from the Pelosi household. And the police have already said that the claim that they've refused to turn it over to the authorities is false. But through repetition and an insistence that you would totally believe the story if they just made that video public. You can convince your audience that it's a reasonable demand and that it makes no sense that the Pelosi is wouldn't release the footage one day want to put that out because it would silence the dissenters. It's suspicious that they're not Yep, so the whole thing this is a tried and true game. It gets played pretty much every time with conspiracies to some degree or another and it's a scam. Cernovich and Alex don't actually want any footage to be released, because they know damn well that it wouldn't prove anything that they want proven. All they want is the ability to use the fact that it's not released as some kind of a means to introduce suspicion and doubt in their audience and you can see clearly that it works. And if

I guess you could read this is Alex saying that the media coverage of it has a script where de Pape didn't actually say where's Nancy? Right. And everybody is just saying that so they could connect with January 6, right, except the debate in his interview, so that that's why he was doing there. They asked where Nancy was right.

Also why do the people rigging the election need to use the names of dead people or people who've moved out of state? If this is such an elaborate plot that they're engaged in? Why couldn't they create fake identities can't just make up names? Hey, how could you plus if the whole scheme relies on fraudulent votes and dead people's names? Where are the examples of that happening in 2020? Alex seems to believe it's a rock solid case that that's what they are doing and what they plan to do. So it seems weird that I don't think I've ever heard him cite one example of it happening there is that Did you know that if you cast an absentee ballot, but you die before election day that they will invalidate your ballot that happened to 3469 voters in Michigan alone? I wonder what Alex thinks about that, and I will continue wondering because he's never mentioned it weird. Also PolitiFact reviewed news reports of instances where people cast ballots on behalf of dead people and found that quote, Republicans were more often the perpetrators. And this isn't always a malicious form of fraud either. Sometimes it's one of the cases where someone dies after casting an absentee ballot and the system doesn't catch it. That does happen sometimes. Or in many cases, it could be a relative or a loved one of the deceased person who felt like casting the vote in their name would have been in keeping in line with their wishes share. It's still fraud, but maybe it's not as rooted in evil or malice, as it might, you might assume, initially, whatever the case, the frequency of people voting and dead people's names is so small as to be irrelevant. This argument Alex has is pathetic and meaningless. But that's because he actually doesn't want he doesn't really think that people should vote. Yeah, he doesn't really care. He also knows that if that's his position like that voting is meaningless, and then nothing will ever change through that system. A whole lot of his listeners will take that as a sign that it's time to take up arms, you probably doesn't want to like fully endorsed that publicly, either of those. He wants a tripling of chaos, like the full on unintended consequences version where everyone goes out and kills all the police. Yeah, well, yeah, he doesn't want that.

Because they need to set the propaganda they need to set the stage first, because there are millions of people in this country, not the viewers, but these moron wildcard idiots that believe leads and whatever they say is gospel number one.

This is some childish shit and his analysis of the situation in the relationship Between the World Economic Forum and the government is non existent, there's no analysis. He knows he's supposed to be mad about this stuff. And these people, because that's what the right wing media audience eats up. So he does it. It's performative outrage and there's nothing really behind it. He even trips himself up about the whole idea that we have no democracy at the end there because he knows that he needs to direct this exciting outburst into partisan politics. It's not that there's no democracy in the country, it's that the Democrats and the Republicans that I don't like are puppets of the World Economic Forum. This kind of destroys the whole premise that there's no democracy, because if you were able to get the support, you could unseat those Democrats and bad Republicans, and only elect people who are hostile to Klaus Schwab. It doesn't matter that he's basically contradicted himself in the course of a minute because the actual things he's saying don't really mean anything. It's about eliciting an emotional response and then directing those emotions into negative feelings towards your political enemies. It's something Alex does a bit better and less transparently than Drew, but Drew's young and also has no discernible convictions past getting attention. So it makes sense that Alex would be better at it. Yeah. Also, pull watching is totally fine. There are tons of poll watchers who operate within acceptable guidelines. What's not okay is voter intimidation, which is what drew and Alex are defending. This has become popular in Alex's crew since at least 2015. But wasn't much of an issue before that, because he didn't really have strong convictions about presidential candidates. Ron Paul never made it out of a primary so never really was an issue. In the lead up to the 2016 election, Larry Nichols was on the show, stressing the need for armed groups to be outside every polling place. And he made an effort to organize around this. In 2020. These ideas continued to circulate heavily in right wing media and Roger Stone made some pushes in that the original stop to steal ideas. And there was clearly these were not attempts to defend election integrity. They were thinly disguised motivations to make people scared to vote. This is happening in this cycle because of course it is. In Mesa, Arizona armed individuals with their faces covered we're seeing patrolling, leading to a Trump back group called Clean Elections USA being ordered by the court to stay at least 75 feet from dropboxes and ordered not to follow or speak to voters. This is because they were doing that shit. Voters reported people watching them from hiding in bushes, people watching them with binoculars, and even taking photos of voters license plates. One voter reported to the DOJ, quote, I have never been more intimidated in my life trying to vote. This is the behavior that Alex and drew are running cover for it. This is what they want to see more of. And here's the thing. I totally understand the vigilantes doing this voter intimidation. If they truly believe the bullshit that folks like Alex and drew yell about day after day, why wouldn't they harass people at the polls and ballot boxes, they have to believe that the election is being stolen and to not do something like what they're doing would be to let that happen. These people are wrong and what they're doing is horrible. But it's the natural conclusion of the rhetoric that Alex and Tucker use every day. If you believe the things that these demagogues say, these actions make total sense that this is the problem. Yeah,

And the number one thing that takes down a society, democracy or a constitutional republic, or any functioning, you know, group of people on planet Earth, money is a voting process. Oh, you take that away, that is the voice of the people. And when you begin to sabotage that that is taking away the voice of the people. So these people know that they're far far advanced enough to understand that this is how it works. And foreign countries that are communist that are globalist that are socialist, they know that the only way to truly take away power from the people is to take away their vote, and also take away their voice. That's why censorship and election meddling and fraud and tampering go hand in hand for a totalitarian regime because those two things need to be functioning simultaneously in order to have a healthy society or a healthy group of people here on plant On an Earth, these globalists, these people, they know this because they're all energized by Satan and Lucifer. What I mean by that is Lucifer, Satan has been around longer than us for a very long time I was studied human behavior for 1000s of years has studied how to manipulate the human mind has studied how to manipulate human emotion has studied how to manipulate societies to do his bidding, to get into the palm of his hand and to get human beings possessed to do what he wants.
