'''Daria Karpova''' is an [[InfoWars]] producer. She works mostly closely with [[Alex Jones]].

Daria was produced as a corporate representative for [[Free Speech Systems LLC]] in [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|Heslin v. Jones]].

She was unprepared for this role<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maDRIkdPAko</ref>:

*She brought a bunch of Wikipedia articles to the deposition<ref>[[641: Formulaic Objections Part 4]] at 2:42:28</ref>.
*She claimed to have not reviewed multiple topics the corporate representative was supposed to prepare on.
*She didn't talk to Alex about the sourcing of videos in plaintiffs petition, despite later testifying that Alex was the sole source for most videos.

Daria's inability to answer the plaintiffs question was part of the reason why FSS was sanctioned in Texas for failing to produce a corporate representative. She was not solely responsible though, since both [[Rob Dew]] and [[Brittney Paz]] were also produced as FSS corporate representatives, and both also failed to meet the standards required.

She testified in the Heslin v. Jones trial on July 26th, 2022.
