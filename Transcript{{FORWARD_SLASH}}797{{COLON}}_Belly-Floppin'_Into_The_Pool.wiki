For him, We Are Change. Hey, it's a knockout lineup of idiots. Yeah, simultaneously right now Tim is trying to rebrand for years. He's done Tim cast and Tim cast IRL, which are apparently two different shows had no idea Tim cast iRL is the one where there are guests and they sit in the studio and about 99% of the time. The guests are figures of the extreme right wing, and it features an incoherent panel discussion about right wing culture war obsession, right. All right. Tim cast on the other hand was his show where like Tim would just be by himself and he'd cold read news headlines and then riff about them.

That's ironic because whether those guys were guilty or innocent, there's no denying that a contributing factor to their conviction was the atmosphere of the Satanic Panic and the idea that they'd killed those children in some sort of an unholy ritual. It's ironic that he's a guest on Tim Show, because Tim is part of a larger cultural movement that's trying its best to whip us all into another Satanic Panic. And no clear evidence of that is that he's having Alex Jones on his show for the eighth episode.

So for the last what feels like a year the right wing media has been preoccupied with a tick tock creator named Dylan Mulvaney. Dylan is an actor and one of the reasons that she's come under attack is that she had a project where she made a daily post on like on tick tock that showed her transition. And it sort of was an attempt to demystify that whole thing and she should have a fun journey. Yeah, through that she's accrued millions of followers. I don't use tick tock so without people like Tim and Matt Walsh complaining about her nonstop I would have no idea who Dylan is. Earlier this month, Bud Light paid her for a promotional Instagram video, which made the right wing media lose their minds. They did the whole thing where they made videos boring out there, Bud Lights, Kid Rock tried to shoot cans of Bud Light and disgust and some weird scammy dude came out with a commercial for an anti woke beer. This was all in response to them not liking Bud Light working with a trans person as a spokesperson in a single video. It was clearly way overblown, and once the high of being mad about it wore off. I think folks like Tim, maybe feel a little embarrassed that they were that upset about a corporation making an ad? I would hope so. And that's why it makes sense that he would move the target. Now it's that Dylan is marketing beer to minors. That's the big issue. It's not just that she's trans. It's not bigotry, it's about law and public safety. It is probably true that a fair amount of Dylan's audience maybe under 18. But that doesn't mean that she can't do a single ad for a beer brand. Or if it does, then you know, it'd be really weird that the same criticism wasn't thrown at Justin Timberlake when he made a Bud Light platinum ad or Chris Pratt when he did a Michelob Ultra Super Bowl commercial or Sarah Jessica Parker when she did a Stella Artois commercial in character as Carrie Bradshaw or Brad Pitt when he did that Heineken commercial in 2005, when he was steady in heartthrob territory,

All of these people have audiences that include a significant portion of people who are under the drinking age. And this isn't a problem for Tim nor for Alex because the idea that Dylan is selling beer to kids is not an actual complaint. It's a rationalization. They realize that they just look like idiots getting so upset about a popular trans creator doing a beer ad so they need to justify it in some way. That makes it look less silly than it is now after the fact. And that's that's kind of why I was delighted but to hear Tim trying to do this shit at the beginning of the show. It's pathetic. Really,

He was Hungary's Prime Minister 20 years ago, and that time when Alex claims no one was like him, also last year or Bonn gave a speech where he explicitly opposed race mixing. So if Alex wants to associate with that tells you a whole bunch about where he's coming from. And 20 years ago, Putin was in charge in Russia. So Alec should have been thrilled about that. Except that 20 years ago, Alex knew that Putin blew up those apartment buildings and he thought that Putin was a real bad dude.

But there are complaints that are typically more grounded based of the mark. Like how the requirements that real ID puts into place for issuing an ID. It has an increased burden on asylum seekers and refugees who might not be able to provide all the necessary documents to prove their identity fair under the new system. So there are issues that need to be ironed out with the way that this system is set up. So there are complaints that can be made, but the ones a year from people like Alex are just stupid, right? Right. So Tim is describing a passport. A real ID is not a North American ID it's issued by a US state. His passport allows him to travel internationally, not just to Canada or Mexico. It appears the Tim may have a passport card that he's describing, which is different. It's an alternative to the book version that you can opt for. The passport card itself only allows for land and sea port border crossings with Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and countries in the Caribbean. It's a cheaper alternative for folks who make frequent land and sea border crossings. But this doesn't seem right for Tim since he's talking about air travel. His passport card doesn't apply to international air travel. I don't know what he's talking about. But whatever it is, it's kind of off base. Yeah,

    | text      = getting demonetized on YouTube isn't a social credit score. That's a reflection that your content is not in line with what YouTube advertisers want to attach their ads to. Yeah, that's just the free market and action. Or at least that's how Alex and Tim should see it. YouTube is too big of a company to handle ads being bought individually, according to channels, so they sell advertising time is a big chunk, the advertisers trust that YouTube isn't going to show their ad on a video that's denying the Holocaust, for instance, and thereby taking payments that the company made to YouTube and funneling it to a Holocaust denier in the form of ad revenue. That's not a social credit score, although perhaps it's a consequence. And that's basically what these shitheads mean, when they say social credit score. Yeah, I'm gonna leave China kind of alone, because there's a murky territory with the idea of their social credit system is there is some stuff that is goes on there. The reason I don't want to get too deep into it is because in China, there's a government version, and then their corporate private versions of social credit scores. And they're often just rolled into one which is said to be run by the government they can. People like Alex conflate a ton of this stuff share, the government version is meant to consolidate credit profiles for individuals to make dealing with credit scores and lending more efficient, whereas many of the private versions involve giving people social scores based on choice. Yeah, gotcha. That second version isn't really any different than how like Lyft and Uber have passenger scores. And if you do something really egregious in someone's car, you're probably gonna have your score, go way down and be blacklisted from the app or drivers will just not accept your request. Yeah, your choices give you a score, and they can choose to do business with you or not. Right. So I mean, like, on some level that is already there, in terms of, like companies making it a choice to implement, share, share, share, share, and in the form of that it exists in terms of Uber and Lyft. I mean, maybe there's an abuse here or there of it, but for the most part, it's about protecting the person who's allowing you into their car. Yeah, to be driven around, it's protecting the worker. And I think there's something find about that. Now, the government version there in China also has like, you know, if you owe the government money, or things like that, they can, you know, make it so it's more difficult for you to get a loan and stuff, right until you pay them back their money. And there are instances where people have oppressive fines by the government just on social things that they do, like criticisms of the government. I'm not saying that it's like a purely non socially related thing. In some, some senses, but the way that this is discussed by people like Alex and Tim is just nonsensical, and it goes nowhere. Yeah, that sounds about right. As for Tim's fantasy about coke costing double, if you're a bad boy, that's pretty stupid. It would never work with two individuals paying different amounts for the same thing at the same place. And it's not like you say that it would be like, you couldn't do one version because it's too overt. But this would be subtle, somehow.

So they have an app that encourages healthiness because they know they're going to make a couple extra bucks if they can sucker you in to be unhealthy, right?

However, after Michelle Malkin tweeted out an article about tarios account, Chase bank actually responded and said, quote, Hi, Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account, we do not close counts based on political affiliation. If I had to guess what was going on, this was an account that was a proud boys account, which happened to have tarios name on it, which the bank decided violated their standards.

You're going to be rightly pissed off and say when to figure out how to get these guns away from these roosters. And obviously roosters don't have guns. But what they do is what they do Saturday, the Spurs roosters as they get older, they grow large keratin spikes on their legs that they can stab you with. And so what do people do? They will come incapacitate the rooster and then take pliers and snap the Spurs off their legs, which is very painful and brutal. I won't do it to my roosters.

    | text      = I think that if a teacher is telling a student unprovoked, that they're pansexual, and then telling them that if they tell their parents that tell them that they're wrong, that's inappropriate. I don't think that's going on and the off chance that there is an instance of this kind of behavior, but I think that specific teachers should be asked some serious questions in an individual, disciplinary setting. Yeah, we're all good with that. However, Tim is telling a story of something that someone said happened and probably didn't. Tim and his ilk aren't fighting against teachers declaring their students to be pansexual out of nowhere. But that's a sensible fight to have, which is why Tim wants you to think that that's what he's against. Yeah, in the real world, there are students who feel more safe at school than they do at home. And they might confide in a teacher about something that they're struggling with, possibly around sexuality, or gender based things. It wasn't around sexuality or gender. But I had a teacher in high school that was critically important in terms of being able to tell him things and talk through stuff in a way that I couldn't with other adults. It wasn't weird or manipulative or abusive, it was critical to me navigating those years 100% That is what Tim and Alex are trying to attack. They push sensational stories, most likely not even true ones that are designed to create crony draconian laws about teachers interacting with students, so no one will take the risk of being kids lifeline. They're doing this as an attempt to stigmatize and ultimately eliminate LGBTQ identities from public life. And they're pretending that it's being done in the name of defending the children. It's not, but that's how Tim and Alex need to present it so they can sleep at night and not be seen as the monstrous shitheads that they actually are.

And each one of them, their perception dictates what reality will be. That means an individual has 10% control, oh, my god, reality. And then perhaps you start seeing things like magic. And they all among each other can take things that are magical. But as population expands, more and more people are competing in their observation with what reality is, which basically solidifies it, it can no longer change, because everyone's perspectives are this massive programming, unless you then Florida date everyone's brain and destroy the part of their brain that connects to the metaphysical.

By means of limited wars, organized epidemics of fatal rapid acting diseases and starvation share the post claim that this was written by Klaus Schwab. But of course, it's fake. It's a passage from a 1992 conspiracy theory book titled The conspirators hierarchy, the Committee of 300 by a guy named John Coleman. Coleman claims that this text appeared in HG Wells book the open conspiracy, but that is also a lie. I found one speech that Harare gives gave where he uses the word useless but it's in describing a negative state of affairs that could arise in the future where the rich use things like bioengineering to turn themselves into superhumans, and the rest of us become an economically and militarily useless class. It's not something that he's saying is good, he says, is a danger of the future, right? It's fun that Tim is responding to a fake thing someone didn't say and using that as a rationalization to allow himself to call people he doesn't like useless eaters, though. Solid fucking work.

They let you get so big as a switch or a dial in case something else gets big. They can turn the dial here, here here and triangulate and dial that down later, they'll use those points to dial you back now. So to them, it's all a bunch of levers and switches and controls.

Tim has discussed how his schedule is so busy in the past, and I can guarantee you that do doesn't listen to Alex's actual show ever. He just knows the image of Alex that he's constructed in his head this renegade truth teller who puts on an entertaining act to make the medicine go down. That's fake, as fake as Alex's claims about how he predicted the Ukraine invasion. These people don't live in reality. They live in a world of stories. fictional works seem real to them because they come in the form they understand, which is a narrative. Alex's existence is too hard to understand if you deal with him in reality, but if you just pretend he's a character in a novel, you imagine your living it's so much easier. I gotta say though, I didn't expect much when I tuned into this episode, but the reveal that Tim Poole thinks that he's some kind of a NOAA figure working to save humanity is pretty interesting.

If content from his show was allowed to be introduced, I suspect he would have lost custody of his kids at that point. Yeah. Clips of a show taken from a larger piece are not necessarily deceptively edited. That's just a knee jerk reaction. Alex has to being called out on any of his ridiculous, hateful and stupid things that he says all the time. Or if you play a clip of him saying those things, they'll just say that it's out of context, and you can't possibly know what he meant by the things that he's saying. He does this because he's a con man and a coward who doesn't want to take responsibility for his own past words and actions. As for deep fakes in court, there is no way the courts are saying that they will knowingly admit fake shit as evidence. Tim knows that's fucking stupid. Also, Rittenhouse won that case so whatever deep faking was going on, there clearly wasn't effective. There wasn't a deep fake introduced into evidence and written houses trial.

I would probably be very unhappy that yeah, Tim doesn't care. Nope. You can use the fact checker. Alex has some thoughts about fact checkers.

We're exactly the fact checkers Alex wants and guess what? He's wrong all the time. Yeah, he's wrong. More than Media Matters says he is he's wrong more than people on Twitter claim he's wrong and more than the people suing him say he is he's an angry narcissistic, idiot. Pure and simple. Yeah. Also, NPR isn't state run media. Ilan had to change that label after he got really strong backlash for saying that they were state run.

If you couldn't ask it about Alex or if it would scold you, I asked Is Alex Jones a bad person and it replied, quote, as an AI language model, I cannot make subjective judgments on whether someone is a bad person or not. However, it's worth noting that Alex Jones has been widely criticized for promoting conspiracy theories that have been debunked by mainstream media and scientific experts. Some of his statements and actions have been considered offensive, harmful and dangerous by many people. His behavior has also resulted in legal challenges and social media bans. It's important to form your own opinion based on your research and critical thinking and to consider multiple perspectives before making a judgement. Long answer, but I think Alex should recognize that's fair. Yeah, to be really precise, though, I asked what Alex said his staffer had asked and I'll be damned, but Chad GPT won't write you a commercial with Alex Jones in it tried a number of variables. It said quote, I'm sorry. As an AI language model, I cannot generate a commercial featuring Alex Jones. Given the controversial nature of Alex Jones and his beliefs, it's important to be mindful of the potential impact such a commercial could have on various groups of people. It's also important to consider the ethics and potential consequences of promoting someone who has been widely criticized for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation, shots fired
