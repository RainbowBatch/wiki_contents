But looping back to the live shows. It's just such, I'm still even riding high a little bit on the the enjoyment of it, that people came out to Milwaukee, I wanted to take a little moment to say thank you. I mean, I thanked everybody that we talked to, you know, everybody who we didn't have a chance to talk to you, thank you for coming. And such wonderful little gifts from people, the i I'm reticent to list any because I think I'll forget one or two other we can't even brought such thoughtful, cool things. People were so kind. I'm usually an incredibly socially uncomfortable person. I do not like large groups of people and such. But it was really not that difficult or emotionally challenging to stay in talk to people for quite a while

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:08:13.000
    | text      = He's not. But we won't really experience much of that. Oh, that's today's a little bit on the off the beaten path. All right. So Jordan, it dawned on me that while I was taking time off, there was a major story surrounding Alex and Infowars that we haven't really covered, but it's super relevant to the news. Okay. A lot of the minor figures around Infowars are really boring, and thus we don't really hear much from them. True. Alex, his business model requires him to be in employing mostly a bunch of tumbleweeds, because if he had competent people in house, they'd realize how easy his gig is and then they do it better. And he'd go out of business. He's incentivized to have a crew of serviceable disappointments at all times. One such serviceable disappointment that we've not really covered too much is currently on trial for being part of a seditious conspiracy. I'm referring, of course, to Rambo Joe Biggs. At this point, the Oathkeepers, who were on trial, including Stewart Rhodes have been convicted of seditious conspiracy, and they're very clear evidence of some communication between Rhodes and the head of the proud boys, the group in which Joe Biggs is second in command. As such, I think there's a very high probability that Biggs is going to end up being found guilty. And the fact that woke insurance underwriter norm Pattice as his lawyer doesn't really help Joe's odds one bit does not now, think about that for a second. If this is what ends up happening, there will be one frequent Infowars guest for over a decade and a former Infowars employee who will both be in prison for being party to a seditious conspiracy. That's fucking insane. Yeah. And we don't spend enough time really reflecting on it. So this is just going to be a silent episode, are you and I mean, just sit and think about it

    | text      = again. I mean, this is why though, obviously, because if you stop and really think of about it, it takes you to some dark places, it's places that make you think some dark things are the right thing to do. And instead just don't think about it,

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:10:17.000
    | text      = I genuinely whenever we started, I was like, I can't believe only 20 or 30, or people are listening to this because we will of course be at the center of an insane sequence of events in five years, naturally, that makes the most sense.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:10:31.000
    | text      = So of course, yeah. So what brought this to the front of my mind was that on Friday, March 10, Joe Biggs called into Infowars and was a guest on Harrison Smith's show for an hour. I'm sorry, what? Yep, he's on trial. Right. He was said to be calling in from the quote, DC Gulag prison, where he's being held. And the situation as Infowars describes, it is like this, quote, Biggs has been held in solitary confinement for over two years without ever being convicted of a crime interesting, I failed to understand how he could be living in a horrible gulag and stuck in solitary confinement and also call into Infowars and be on air for a fucking hour. Yeah, seems a little bit incongruent. It seems like Joe is trying to get some juice here for his Gibson TO GO Campaign to pay his legal expenses. So this is in service of that check that shows you fully understand that that is why this has happened. So

    | name      = Jordan

    | timestamp = 00:11:31.000
    | text      = Yeah, I guess we're commissary or something, right? Oh, yeah. So I went and checked out the campaign, and he's trying to raise $250,000. And it's not even a 10% of that. That's good. Fun fact, though. Gavin McInnes is his top donor with $1,732, which is nice. It's cool that the guy who started the gang Biggs was a part of his throwing a couple of bucks at the problem and not being held responsible for his actions

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:11:58.000
    | text      = I'm not certain of it. But I think that Gavin's donation is a reference to US legal code 1732, which has to do with the release of citizens imprisoned by foreign governments. This is cute how they don't think our government is actually our government when it's convenient, but definitely do when they can use it to wield power against the groups that

If after the Tea Party, they were like, Oh, cool. Well, you guys are just in jail now goodbye forever. You know, like that would be a different situation. So that was a seditious conspiracy. The American country is based upon a seditious conspiracy or essentially one. Yeah. And that's the crucial part. And that's unsportsmanlike conduct to to complain about losing.

And when Harrison asks how he's doing his answers, I'm doing pretty good. Am I right? Second, Something doesn't add up about the story he's telling about his pretrial detention. I can't reconcile the idea that he's in this terrible situation. And yet he has access to a phone for at least an hour in his cell and no one stops him from calling into a right wing propaganda show that is actively involved in spreading the conspiracy that fueled Biggs's crime, particularly given that Joe is calling into that show predominantly to promote his gifts and GO Campaign raise money.

I think that Joe Biggs is a giant piece of shit. But that doesn't change that he's a person and you can't hold people in abusive conditions. If we're going to have a state that incarcerates, we have to at least require that we've talked about this a little in the past, but that DC jail does have a troubling history. So it doesn't seem impossible to imagine that the conditions that Joe is in are less than ideal for sure. It would have been nice to see concern about these conditions from Joe or anyone at Infowars before it affected them personally, but I guess we can't ask for a miracle. Also, it's not lost on me how entirely supportive Infowars is of Joe Arpaio who might as well be the patron saint of abusing pretrial defendants in custody. Yeah, I know that hypocrisy means nothing to these people. But I would hope that seeing the person they care about make these kinds of claims about his detention conditions would cause them to reconsider what Joe Arpaio does, but they won't

Whatever complaints Joe has about his conditions in the jail should be taken seriously, not just on his behalf, but on behalf of the people held in that facility who don't have access to a large propaganda outlet to speak on. All that being said, this has nothing to do with the reason he's being held in detention, which is storming the capitol to try and stop the 2020 election from being certified, which he definitely did. Yeah. Now, all that being said Also on Tuesday, a federal judge denied a motion brought by another January 6, defendant Christopher Kragen, who claimed that his rights were violated in that DC jail. That certainly doesn't mean that no one experienced anything inappropriate, but it does take into account that a lot of the general conditions that the January 6 defendants are in and it doesn't seem like a lot of the picture that someone like Joe is painting are accurate. Yeah. And I don't know how much too that is Joe's doing and how much of it is like he's part of an embellishment machine. Yeah. You know, like Infowars.

And she filtered out the ones that were not germane to the case, or ones that couldn't be turned over. She messed up by not actually deleting them. But instead, they were on the sheet in a hidden cell, oh, my God, one of the things in that hidden cell that's been disclosed of them, like one of them, there's a message where an agent was told to destroy, quote, 338 items of evidence, but an Assistant US Attorney has clarified that this is not related to the proud boys case, according to a court filing this related to a nearly 20 year old case.

But this isn't going to stick for REL or the proud boys because it's not protected communication, according to the prosecution. As it turns out the messages that the FBI agents were allegedly discussing were captured through the TruLink system, quote, inmates consent to monitoring of their use of the true links and electronic messages system every time they log into a true Linux terminal at the FTC. In the banner warning inmates are explicitly advised that electronic messages and system activity are subject to monitoring and retention. Inmates are further specifically advised that electronic messages to and from an attorney are monitored and quote will not be treated as privileged communications and that their consent to such monitoring and information retrieval for law enforcement purposes. That's gonna be a tough hurdle for REL and the defense to clear because from where I'm sitting, kind of looks like this dude, just fucked up and now they're desperately trying to get things thrown off course, on a pretend technicality. Yeah, that's not going to work. Also, this happened with Rails communication. So Biggs has literally no standing to claim that his rights were violated.

    | text      = Incidentally, I've been reading a bit of the writings of Ravello P Oliver lately, and I came across an interesting passage. All of her, of course, was one of the 12 founding members of the John Birch Society who would go on to become a really public, anti Semite, and white supremacist, eventually finding himself as the mentor for William Luther Pierce, who would go on to write The Turner Diaries, which is the essential text of the militia groups in the 90s. Upon which must much of the street gang organizations like the proud boys and Oathkeepers are modeled, there's a straight line for him to not complicated. Yeah. In his text, the religion of the West, Oliver says, quote, during the Middle Ages, our ancestors occupied the greater part of Europe and until they discovered the American continent, they lived only in Europe. But despite that geographical unity, they did not generally refer to themselves as the Europeans. For all practical purposes. Furthermore, our ancestors belong to the same division of the white race. They like the true Greeks and true Romans before them were all members of The Great Race that we now call indo European or Aryan, but they had in their language, no words to designate their blood relationship and biological unity. Thus, when they refer to the unity of which they were always conscious as something transcending the constantly shifting territorial and political divisions of Europe, they called themselves Christendom. So to some of the points so far there was this group of pure real white people, but they didn't have a word to describe their racial groups that they use the word Christendom. All of her goes on to quote, Christianity is the religion of the West and for all practical purposes only of the West. It is not as Christians once generally believed a universal religion, for experience has now proved that it cannot successfully be exported to populations that are not indo European. Ah, so you understand that there is a synonymous relationship here, a code Nabi it's pretty critical as an underpinning to understand when dealing with groups, like the proud boys this relationship, the intellectual tradition that they exist within very strongly and clearly believes that the words Western and Christendom are synonymous with Aryan. In essence, the existence of the proud boys is violence in and of itself. When they show up to a protest, they're there as shock troops of that intellectual tradition aimed at intimidating or outright attacking the things that they see as being a threat to Western dominance in heavy quotes. Yeah, so no, I don't buy Harrison's bullshit. And further even leaving that context to the side because you know, I don't think that they sit around thinking about Roe v lO, P, all of her and the, the tradition within that they exist with it.

The only folks he has half a chance with are those who are already in the cult. So why bother evangelize? Yeah, just paint the people that you can't convince his stupid grift from the cult members and move on. Joe lived his own life, so he knows better than anyone else what he did. If you read the indictments that have been released, it could be argued that Joe Biggs is actually the person who incited all the planning that the proud boys did leading up to January 6, that's not good on December 20 22. By too many twos too many twos on December 28 2020. Enrique TARIO set up an elite group called the ministry of self defense, which included Joe Biggs. This was a day after Biggs texted TARIO, complaining that the proud boys quote, recruit losers who want to drink and that they should, quote, get radical and get real men. This conversation occurred shortly after the January 6 rally was announced and the ministry encrypted chat is where a whole lot of shit that Joe's pretending didn't happen went down. In theory, you could say that it looks like Joe's encouragement led to TARIO going down this path. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. In that group chat and others that split off from it that included Biggs, there was plenty of talk of occupying the Capitol on January 6, and talks of how it was going to be much different from their normal operations. When TARIO was arrested on January 4, everyone tried to delete their history in the group and started a new one that didn't include TARIO because everything that they were doing was totally legal, and not at all involved storming the Capitol, and their new group a member said quote, at least they won't get our boots on the ground plans because we're one step ahead of them. I am that's one step ahead of the cops. If you're confused, I am blown away criminals are the people who are generally concerned about where the cops are in terms of steps. In the new group, it was posted, quote, everything is compromised and we can be looking at gang charges stop everything immediately. This comes from the top. I mean, you know, if you weren't planning anything, it seems weird that someone at the top was demanding everyone stop everything immediately. really smells like gang planning stuff.

The arms were waiting in an Oathkeeper safe house just outside DC because they knew that they couldn't open carry on Capitol grounds in this circumstance. The plan was to have someone deliver the arms to the Patriots if ship popped popped off and Trump deputize the militias to be his personal army. Oathkeeper leader Stewart Rhodes who was convicted of seditious conspiracy was the meeting with proud boy leader and Joe Biggs, his best buddy Enrique TARIO, in a parking structure on January 5, which really does imply some sort of working relationship point is the fact that they had the initial shock troops on the ground instigating the conflict and they didn't have gotten so that doesn't mean that there weren't plans in place to arm people later. If Harrison has paid any attention to the cases, he knows this, so he's either not paid attention, or he's lying to carry water for insurrectionist because he supports the idea of their insurrection. Yeah, I suspect it to the latter, given the Glee at reporting how the Patriots had taken over the Capitol on January 6, he had such Glee in his voice so he was exuberant.

I'm not, not everybody guy. No, I know, he didn't try and understand it. You know, call it out where you can and I think the most important thing is just be sure to reinforce your own connection to reality, because that that is a stabilizing force. But for now, I want to leave this to the side and jump into another topic that I think is under discussed, which is Joe Biggs career at Info Wars. Many people who ended up at Info Wars got there by winning a contest or coming in second place in a contest or by coming in third place in a contest or just by entering the contest. It will be easy to assume that this is true of Joe, but that would be incorrect. Joe Biggs came into the Info Wars orbit in 2013. And a pretty fascinating way. On June 18 2013, journalist Michael Hastings died in a car accident that became a bit of a conspiracy theory. Hastings had done some bombshell work in his young career with his Polk award winning Rolling Stone article The Runaway general more or less directly leading to the resignation of General Stanley McChrystal. Beyond that he did a lot of work surrounding the war in Iraq and was very critical of many aspects of US foreign policy. It's hard not to think that he had a really promising career ahead of him and his loss deprive the world of someone who had a lot of talent and potential that he died at 33. It was very, very tragic. So how does this relate to Joe Biggs? It turns out Hastings was embedded in Iraq with some US soldiers a number of years prior back in 2008. And guess who was one of those soldiers? Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs. Apparently the two of them had become friendly and kept in touch a little after Joe had retired from the service. After Hastings death, Joe made it his business to be the face of the Hastings death conspiracy team, framing himself as a close close friend of Hastings. The day after Hastings death, Joe tweeted at a KTLA reporter and from there went on any platform that would have him including Fox News, RT Megan Kelly, and of course Infowars. What makes Joe's story something more than just a tall tale that you would just probably need to ignore is that he was in possession of an email that Hastings sent to him the day before his death. It was an email that he sent to his colleagues, but for some reason Joe Biggs was BCC it on it. And it was the infamous message where he said, quote, I am onto a big story and I need to go off the radar for a bit. Shortly thereafter, he was dead in what appeared to many to be suspicious circumstances. Joe believed that this was all the proof you needed to make a conspiracy. So he took it upon himself to show the reporter at KTLA, this email, who did manage to confirm that the email was real with the help of Hastings coworkers, it was apparently authentic. And weirdly, Joe was copied on it. For reasons that are on I have no idea and I don't think anyone will ever know. But none of these colleagues wanted to talk, which Joe obviously understood to mean that they were scared, but he wasn't. Joe was a big strong man who would go on to lead a street gang and failed to overthrow the country. So he was more than ready to get all of the attention he could out of his alleged good friend's death. On June 26 2013, Joe went on Infowars for the first time and told Alex about the basics of the story. But things wouldn't really kick into high gear until he made his return trip on July 11. This interview is textbook Alex and it's a really fantastic example of how you can see Alex integrating information people give him and turning it into conspiracy fodder in real time. As such, I thought it would be a good use of our time to check in on that interview. Sounds good? July 11 2013. I'm down for it. Do what do you remember about Hastings? Because I'm sure you were aware of that story at the time.

And, of course, that was Michael Restall now a few weeks ago, his car he most of you know, the story blew up while driving down the street and the engine shot down the road, the other direction. And I talked to well known reporter Nomi Prins, who lives nearby, she went looked at the tree wasn't really damaged. And it looked like from the photos that came up to rest against it. Then we learn he was getting death threats, hours before he said, I'm gonna go into hiding off the radar. I've got my biggest story ever. Listen, if I ever come on air and say I'm getting threats, I'm going off the radar. I'm about to break my biggest story ever. And my car blows up. Man, I want an investigation. And I said on air a few weeks ago, I said it's a very low probability that this wasn't some type of car bomb.

    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 01:00:41.000
    | text      = Okay, so there have been multiple investigations done about the crash. And experts have been very clear that there's nothing about the facts of the case that would make you think that there was a bomb in the car. The contents of automobiles are very flammable as it turns out, and you can look at a car going on fire rapidly and think that it looks like an explosive device, but it is almost certainly not. Alex has made up his mind here though, and is establishing set talking points for the story that are not based in reality. Also, the email that Hastings sent did say that he was going off the radar, but he didn't say that he was onto his biggest story ever. He might have said that to other people, though, because there's a little piece that Alex and Joe don't address here but of the story because I think that they probably don't know it. And even if they did, it doesn't fit their narrative so they wouldn't bring it out. Okay. Michael Hastings had a hearing history of bipolar episodes, and his brother has come out and given his story about the lead up to Hastings death. taken along with the other information that's available, his death really doesn't look that suspicious anymore. In an interview with salon his brother said, quote, I rule out foul play entirely. I might have been suspicious if I hadn't been with him the day before he died. He also explained what that means, quote, a few days before he died, Mike called me and I got the impression that he was having a manic episode similar to one he had had 15 years ago, which he had referred to in his writing. At the time, drugs had been involved. And I suspected that might be the case again, I immediately booked a flight to LA for the next day with the thought that maybe I could convince him to come back to Vermont to dry out or less likely get him to go to detox rehab there in LA. When I got to LA and I saw him I immediately realized that he was not going to go willingly. I started to make arrangements with our other brother to fly out and help me possibly force Mike into checking himself into a hospital or detox center. I thought that I at least convinced Mike to just stay in his apartment and chill out for the next few days. But he snuck out on me while I was sleeping. He crashed his car before anyone could do anything to help him. Michael was 14 years sober or so it was believed but his brother had a strong suspicion that he was using again, on top of very likely having a manic episode. In 1999. He had been institutionalized for rehab having abused prescription drugs, including stimulants. His brother told the police that Michael didn't have suicidal tendencies, but that he quote, believed he was invincible, believing he could jump from a balcony and be okay. Prior to the tragic crash. Michael's family was trying to get him help. And it clearly didn't work. Unfortunately, yeah. Based on the behaviors people can have when they're in a manic episode, particularly if they're also using stimulants, they might make grandiose statements that aren't totally connected to reality. If he told someone he was on to the biggest story ever, that could have been his mania talking. And that's probably why his colleagues didn't take that email that he sent them. There's anything too serious. But for Alex and Biggs, they don't have the context. And so they think that everyone just meet must be too scared to talk about. Michael's brother was there and he knew what was going on. Michael's widow came on CNN and said, quote, you know, my gut here was that this is just a really tragic accident. And I'm very unlucky and the world was very unlucky. These were the people who are actually close to Michael and cared about him and we're respecting his memory in the wake of his death. Joe Biggs knew Hastings from his military days and they clearly kept in touch somehow, but he's overplaying that shit in order to cash in on his supposed good friend's death. It's pretty gross stuff. But it shouldn't be surprising. Yeah, Joe Biggs has been a piece of shit the entire time. He has been in the public eye from his introduction to the right wing media to his pizza gate shit to his Jade Helm coverage to his leadership in a gang that tried to overturn an election. So

This is how Alex operates. And it's not as a sincere interviewer. He has a conclusion in mind that he's already decided to push as his narrative. In this case, it's that Michael Hastings was killed by a car bomb as retribution for his reporting or to stop him from reporting on the thing he was working on at the time. Everything that Joe says or any guests says really will be filtered through that narrative, and Alex will be constantly working to try and make whatever is said fit the narrative. Alex hears Joe say nonsense about the body and Alex decides to jump to the conclusion that the body is missing. So now the question is, why is the body missing within the narrative? What's the real isn't someone who would lose the body? It's obviously to cover up for the explosives. That's the story Alex is writing as a way to make every piece of information conform to his narrative. But none of its real. It's all completely imagined in his head.

There was a huge conspiracy blitz around the idea that they hadn't, which was reported by a local news person in San Diego named Kim Dvorak, based on something she heard from a quote, close family friend who I would bet anything is Joby goddamnit. The family wanted cremation after all the autopsy and toxicology results were done, which happened. Everything Joe and Alex are saying is disconnected from reality. It's just a real shame. Yeah, it's, and this is the this is like the point I want to make. Yeah, there's two things that are happening here. One is that Joe is allowing Alex to distort and twist everything he's saying in service of a bizarre and unhinged conspiracy, that he should know better than to do that this is not a sincere actor at work. Right? And then Alex, you can see the way that he's working. You know, you can see the way that he's taking these little pieces, and then recontextualizing them reframe them. Oh, the body is missing. Yeah. In trying to get it into ways that he can work with it. Yeah. You see those two trains running a sort of parallel?
