So what do you does what Dave does, it's completely different from the dial up. See Dave read something to Gareth who reacts to it? No, but he picks a newspaper from, you know, a random place in the past or whatever, and just reads it to you. And the reason that this hit me so hard is because the moment we listened to it, I remembered that when I was growing up in my hometown, there's this historical society that had all these microfiche newspapers. And I fucking read constantly. I loved reading those to the point where one sentence is always stuck out in that sentence like little fragment has always stuck in my head, which is just another hand went missing, like and it's like, I cannot believe I can't believe this

That brings us to the level of it being something that should be on his show, right. And he's being a real shithead. Yeah, this is about 27 year old Terry Horrigan, who suffered from a very rare form of muscular dystrophy. His brother, Richard was the head of a nonprofit called cure rare disease, which had led a push for exploring gene editing therapy possibilities for conditions like the one his brother had. Dairy was going to get a tailor made treatment, and had signed up for it. But he passed. According to stat news, quote, it's unclear when or even if he received the experimental treatment. In reality, this is a rare condition that is pretty commonly fatal. It's been estimated that between the ages of 20 and 2586, out of 1000, patients with this condition would die. And past the age of 40. That number goes up to 336 out of 1000. Every year. Yeah, the median survival age of someone born in the year that Terry was with this condition is 28.1 years, right, which is close to 27, which was the age that he is right. We don't know if he even got the treatment. And even if he did, we have no idea if it was connected to his passing. Even if we do find out that it was connected to the treatment, it wasn't an mRNA treatment, and this has nothing to do with COVID vaccines. Alex is a monster trying to capitalize on this young man's death and exploit him. So he can be used as a prop to push anti Vax bullshit. It's disgraceful. And if I were this guy's brother, I would probably think about suing Yeah,

So you're not going to wind up getting all of the trials and everything you need to develop any therapy within any kind of reasonable length of time through the FDA or all of those possible channels. If you go through all these testings and all that stuff, something along those lines, where it is, hey, we've got this rare disease.

Now it's not about Biden being at and a geriatric patients not about Fetterman manga, mentally destroyed, giant zombie goblin leader. It's none of that. It's all about Trump, the Santas and Trump is the reason Republicans didn't win bigger total distraction from reality and Trump has waded straight into it and is attacking to Sanders. I wish he would just stop.

He doesn't like the idea of Trump and DeSantis fighting because that's a competing narrative from his own. And it's one that he can't really profit from. Alex wants all the right wing audience to be swept up in the stop the steel type stuff where he could do another dumb caravan tour and yell at rallies about how much proof he has of election fraud. That's great for Alex because he can make a lot of money off that he never has to prove a damn thing and he gets to be seen as the crusading hero of the Patriots. Conversely, Trump DeSantis is a dead end. That fight is no good for Alex because neither choice is really that great for his bottom line. And if the audience is forced to pick a side because they're fighting, Alex is expected to have a position. Yep, Alex's already done his whole I give Trump two weeks to come out against the vaccine, or else I'll attack him and Trump didn't give a single shit. Alex has already embarrassed himself with his constant. I swear I'm leaving this time for real stuff that he does. If he does actually decide that he doesn't want to be on Trump's side anymore, who cares? It won't have any impact and the only result will be pissing off the members of his audience that still like Trump, and staying as things are and being on Trump's team again is also embarrassing because Alex made all these ultimatums and Trump didn't care which shows that Alex is a spineless coward. On the flip side, going over to DeSantis has its own problems. Many of the listeners, particularly long term listeners have a little bit of hero fatigue. They were sold a bill of goods about how Trump was going to change everything and he was the God appointed leader they needed to trust no matter what and what did it amount to, basically nothing but chaos and an ego driven asshole picking fights. Having gone through all that it's understandable if many of the listeners aren't super keen to adopt a new God King, once bitten, twice shy and all that you would think there's problems here with this fight. This is not the state of affairs Alex wants to see, in a perfect world, Trump and DeSantis would work together or at very least, they would be like kind of respecting opponents. So Alex wouldn't have to pick aside this early. This is clearly bad for his wallet at this point.

Apparently, even your feelings are just the result of the globalists tricking you into feeling that way. Yeah. Is that That's crazy. Yeah. So I guess the GOP overconfidence was part of why they didn't win the midterms. And that was caused by the globalists in the media who were saying that the GOP was going to win, which caused Republicans to stay home and not vote right. Which is stupid. Yes, I'm not sure that many of the voters Alex is talking about take their voting cues from the mainstream media. But an even bigger problem is that Alex was constantly talking about how the midterm was going to be a red tsunami and a bloodbath if reporting that the GOP was gonna win big is actually a psyop to lower GOP voting than Alex is the guiltiest party of that. Also, Alex has presented literally nothing to support his claims of voter fraud and irregularity. This is just something he can assert with no evidence, and it's accepted as proven by the audience at this point. They've been taught to feel that everything that they don't win has been stolen from them. So no proof is necessary to defend this claim that they feel is deeply true.

They alleged that in a fight during their divorce, Warnock hit his now ex wife with a car. In reality, she had claimed that he had run over her foot, but there's a little bit of trouble with the story. Firstly, Warnock was the one who called the police to his ex wife's home to report that she had accused him of running over her foot. The police came and found that she was quote, reluctant to show her foot to an officer. And the police report said this, quote, I did not see any signs of Miss Louise foot was run over, not able to locate any swelling, redness or bruising or broken bones on the left foot. It's entirely possible that he could have run over her foot and not left any of those signs. It's not likely but it is possible it could happen. It's possible if this This is what Roger has to attack Warnock with compared to the very clear and verifiable dirt that Walker has got going against him. This doesn't feel very compelling.

Anyway, the car and the accident that Roger had in Florida was really weird. One of the T votings. This happened back in 2017. And the circumstances of that one were really bizarre. Oh, my God. They were Roger was apparently in the car and there was supposedly a hit and run accident. The police are called but for some reason, they don't show up until 70 minutes later. And when they get there, Rogers nowhere to be found. He apparently waited 30 minutes then got it. leaving the scene of his alleged assassination attempt. I don't buy the whole like this was a they were trying to take me out based on the circumstances. Yeah. So he was just in another car accident in Memphis or just outside Memphis and this is one I've seen pictures of the car because they posted some pictures and it looks like a bad crash. I don't know if there's any evidence that it was done intentionally but that car was banged up. Whoo. So the crash itself happened in Germantown, Tennessee, and their police department has a Twitter account where they have a habit of giving people updates on things like traffic situations. For instance, on October 21, they tweeted quote, Our officers are working a motor vehicle crash in the area of Poplar Avenue and brachten Avenue. Currently we have traffic shut down consider using an alternate route. Or on September 9, they tweeted quote to car vehicle crash at Poplar in Germantown Road, East travel lanes are blocked, please use an alternate route check on November 10. Right around when Rogers accident would have happened. They tweeted quote officers that are on the scene of a crash where a utility pole was struck and damaged on Wolf River Boulevard near Riverdale. westbound, lanes on Wolf River are being diverted causing delays in the area. There is no other tweets about car accidents or traffic issues since October 24. I don't think this was Roger because they found another written news report about this accident the person driving the car was taken to the hospital. But here's how I ended up wasting so much time. I'm interested to know I saw a picture of the car. Oh no. And it had an upward angle. Oh, and I saw a bridge.

And so I decided to sit out. Yeah, this one. Yeah. I don't know what the circumstances of this teacher are or anything. Yeah. But Alex's line, the School Board reviewed their standards to see if there was anything that they could do in terms of imposing a dress code and found that it could raise human rights concerns and also have implications in terms of labor rights and employment law. Right. But the board didn't make any position or change on this because they can't right now. The superintendent of human resources for the school board, sorry, Taha said, quote, even if we are to consider a workplace rule in that sense, we can't do that. This is because they're currently in the middle of collective bargaining, and the board isn't permitted to make rule changes in the middle of that process. Right? Right. They make a good point, though, that even a good faith rule about dress code or grooming standards could easily end up being applied in discriminatory fashion. But the larger point is that they're in collective bargaining so they can't even consider a rule change. Yeah, oh, it's probably just a headline like the one in the National Post that says quote, school board concludes it can't implement dress code after teacher wears giant fake breasts. And then he write his wrote his own story about it without looking into it any further and realizing that the reason that the headline says that they concluded they can't implement a dress code is because their collective bargaining right but so there is a decent chance that they might not even if they weren't, yeah, no, I

So he has a large stretch of his career writing books with Judy mikovits, the person who is behind pandemic, that ship documentary, quote, unquote, great. And so he has a long career as a big time anti Vaxxer. And in 2017, he ended up being denied entry into Australia because of it. Yeah. Because they he was just going to do a bunch of anti Vax rallies, and they're like, No, yeah, get out of you. At that point, he had branded himself quote, the world's number one anti Vaxxer. So he kind of gets rid of the, the arguments that he was trying to make when he was denied entry into Australia that he was like, just raising concerns and asking questions and stuff. And also, when he was told he couldn't come, he sent a letter to the Australian government that was taunting, Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister share, here's a passage from that love it, quote, if you wish to greet me at the airport, when I land, I would be amenable to such an effort or if you think our meeting should be at the lodge, the primary residence of the Prime Minister, I would accept that as well.
