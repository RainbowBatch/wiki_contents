What today we're going to be talking about what happened over the weekend? Yes. Now I will say that it was one of the most delightful birthday weekends I've had in a long time. We went together to go see the dollop we did. It was fantastic. They were in town and my best friend in the world. Nicky gifts was in town, him and his wife got to spend some time with him. I closed down an arcade bar one night of the weekend. And then Alex Jones did what he did on Saturday. Okay, this is a great birthday gift that he gave me. All right. It's so good.

Now we're going to deal with one of them briefly because it's not really worth going into and it's kind of stupid. The the one we're going to deal with first was about how people are diagnosing Trump with a mental illness. Right. And that's bad. Takes one to know one. Well, the

    | text      = Goldwater. It was Goldwater called the Goldwater rule. Okay. Psychologists and psychiatrists are, well, it's basically something that they've decided to impose on themselves. Because what happened with Goldwater was that a bunch of people, psychiatrist, psychologists were interviewed in a magazine, the ask them to diagnose Barry Goldwater.

    | text      = a bunch of diagnoses. And then he sued them. And he won. Good call. So now psychiatrists, and psychologists aren't supposed to diagnose public figures that they have not actually interacted with, right. However, at this point, there are a number of mental health professionals who are coming out and their argument is that they have a right to warn or an obligation to warn people Interesting. Well, it's the same thing that if you're in therapy, and you say, you're going to kill someone, right, the therapist is obligated to either tell the police or the potential victim, right? They have to do that because otherwise they're being negligent. Right. So these therapists and psychiatrist are arguing that President Trump, I believe, I read that I said,

    | text      = But that's the problem with these like guidelines. I don't know how I feel about it to be perfectly honest, I think that there is a little bit of gray area in terms of diagnosing someone that you haven't had sat down with and, you know, had the right direction with, but at the same time, you can see by behaviors very clearly, you can tell that Trump lies all the fucking time pretty much constantly. So there are those things you can see publicly without actually having a session with somebody. And, you know, like I said, it's great

That is not a good but he also does what you can be you could smell this coming a mile away. He wants to talk about Trump and mental health. He talks about himself a whole lot. Oh, yeah. Makes it about himself. I'm not crazy. So I have two clips that I'm gonna play. The first is classic narcissist. Move. The The first is just fun. Okay. And then the second one is kind of a summation of his point. And we'll just play it out. Here's the first one. Like I said, this one's fun.

And I would be like, I I'd be way more concerned about the content than the actual obscenity. I would rather someone swear and have good intent. Yeah, but that's what rational people believe me, I guess. So anyway, there's an X clip. This is just sort of as an encapsulation, and sort of how he ends the clip, just sort of a thesis statement about the psychology stuff. As I recall, he basically makes the argument that narcissism is bullshit and everybody, but then he displays broadly narcissistic tendencies, excellent as it plays.

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 00:08:59.000
    | text      = But they give us fantasy, they give us entertainment, they give us all this other stuff. So we then roleplay all things that don't exist. So they teach you how to be more mentally ill and it creates more more mental illness that didn't exist before. We're being trained to do this make sense? So they say thinking you're successful thinking you have prowess, thinking you have any confidence is insane. They don't want you to have any confidence. They want to say confident people have a mental illness. But then other people I wouldn't call it narcissism. I'd call it being posers or make believe they love to always dress up. They love to go to award shows. They love to give themselves awards, like they love to believe they're super powerful. They get all delusional and get off on it. Like in Vanity Fair, Prima Donna, they imagine they've got a successful rock band. They want to go to a movie theater and have a party where people come in and take photos of them as they enter like they've got paparazzi. They do they want to go I guess most people that are in media do it because they are make believe want to be stars. And like Edward Bernays said the 20s will emerge. Hollywood and politics and make everybody stars and everybody else that isn't a star and as low level, I'm not involved in media to be a star. I'm involved to change the world for the future of humanity. So I get why the narcissist, psychologists and psychiatrists who want to be the bosses and the superstars who control everyone and save everyone, typecasting themselves as the heroes. Wait, where were they want to type them?

Because this is something he should not be talking about. Absolutely. Not a terrible idea. I was talking to you earlier. And I told you my theory as to why he's decided to bring back up Sandy Hook. Yes. And that is because he's in this custody trial. And there's a lot of people clowning on him on Twitter, saying, Hey, we should follow Alex Jones around after he loses his kids and tell them that they were actors the whole time. Yes. So there's a lot of people making that kind of joke gleeful shot in Freud. And so he now has to be like, fuck, they're hitting the spot. I got to come out and prove that I'm right. Right.

So in this, we're going to play this out. It was an hour long clip that he put out, I have cut out some I've cut a bit, because there's a lot of stuff that's just repetitive shit about how he's not an actor. And he's totally real, just literally verbatim, the same stuff that we've heard in past episodes. And we don't need to go down that road again. Yeah, naturally, there's a lot of other stuff that he just uses vaguely true instances of the media lying to reinforce his arguments. I've cut out a lot of that too. Because like, I don't believe you when you're saying that the media is lying, but I also don't want to defend the media. Yeah, so I have no skin in that game. I don't care

And you got video of the kids going in circles in and out of the building. And they don't call the rescue choppers for two hours. And then they tear the building down and seal it and they get caught using blue screens and a email by Bloomberg comes out in a lawsuit where he's telling his people get ready in the next 24 hours to capitalize on a shooting. Yeah, so Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors. In my view, manufactured I couldn't believe it at first. I knew they had actors there, clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids, and just shows how bold they are. They clearly used actors. I mean, they even ended up using photos of kids killed in mass shootings here. In a fake mass shooting in Turkey. Show Yeah. Or Pakistan. The sky is now the limit. I appreciate your call.

This is a five year old, on average all the time, it wasn't just Jews. In China, it's the same. At 13 years of age, they would normally do a cultural test to see if you're a man and pass you into manhood or womanhood the next year, the next year was like school that was done in a local priests, the shaman, the tribal leaders. To be able to culture at 1213 or 14, you would you would go through testing and through rituals, or have hunting of science of different test by the different elders. To see if you are an adult yet. When you were when they said you were an adult, then you could decide to leave your parents house, leave somewhere else, do something else, go join an uncle and another, you know, tribe, or whatever. Or you can get married, stay in the tribe, whatever you want it or wait. But you had to decide if you're going to be a man or a woman and leave or stay. Now normally, by the time you get about 16, you're always kicked out. Unless you have special needs. Interesting.

And I'm I regret that I was caught up in it, but I I knew even when I was making those arguments, I'm like, I know I'm wrong to feel this way. But I don't exactly know why. Now I can see very clearly it's absolutely. It's insecurity. Yes. It's a feeling of not being valued to the same level that you value what you do, and it's natural, but it is embarrassing to see Out of someone who's a propagandist, who makes millions of dollars a year selling bone juice, right?
