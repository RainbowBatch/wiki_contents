But in the same way that Final Fantasy Tactics is it's one of the best Final Fantasy games interesting. It's really really good. It doesn't have all of the final fantasy stuff that you're used to, you know, there's no turn battles. There's the, the equipment is almost superfluous. All that you're there to do is run around, read or watch a brilliant TV show and then punch stuff.

Kennedy Jr. and that that would make people like Joe Rogan dig deeper into the science and find out not only the shot, shot work, but they knew they didn't work and they created the virus and erases your immune system and it's a plant any population. When I said on air, the globalists are so arrogant that they're going to do this and push it and that will bring them down to happen quicker than I thought though. Number one story in the world. Hundreds of millions of views a day. Idiots run man's life alone that I just checked YouTube, same thing. I'm sure it's everywhere else Facebook got Instagram. Like I know there's hundreds and hundreds of millions and I say hundreds millions Joe Rogan's getting hundreds of millions today, himself. Just regular response videos are getting like 10 million, 5 million, and there's 1000s of people posting him. And there's all these folks going out just the general public, and finding all the clips of Peter Hotez, who helped spearhead these poisoned shots against the American people and who spearheads calling to the arrest of anyone that doesn't take shots. And the arrest of anyone that questions the scientist, and he says questioning is the opposite of science. Debating is the opposite of science. These are quotes. He just went on and said it.

So, he there is a phenomenon of people who have like tick tock channels or YouTube channels where they pretend to be underage folks right and then lured someone and then gotcha report the the basically Chris do to catch them out of the police generally being involved, right, that's usually an important part. I think that you know, not to defend anybody who is cruising for underage people online. Because, you know, I have a whole lot of sympathy for you know, them getting embarrassed. Yeah. But I do think in the same way that like coming to someone's house to ask investigative journalistic questions is best left to people who have accountability and have a certain amount of a job or protocol, things like that bad place. It is better I think generally, I find it very worrying the idea of people who've gotten make cottage industries of themselves hunting down people vigilante ish online. Yeah, I, you know, I think that there's a lot of possibilities for that to go wrong. There's also a lot of possibilities for you to have your evidence and not be accepted and someone not actually get in trouble. Yeah.

In fact, not only the United States, but we're talking about America served as let's say, social anchor. And the middle class I like the poor is very interested in having a strong state, even as a strong state is controlled by the bankers, which it is today.

And you know, just like, Hey, you're the best man. Oh, my God, you are a primary high level source that we haven't really work. Like, a lot of the people that Alex has had on in the like past years, they've been worn out. Yeah, you know, no one cares anymore. Their name is not going to get anyone excited. And so now this is somebody who's like, oh, maybe maybe his authoritative voice can be exciting for a little while. But yeah, it'll be boy diminishing returns way diminishing.

And so he was doing the force that fourth hour and then he started to get really into Hitler and really, really anti semitic, he was really into Hitler very much. So to the point where I think it wouldn't be fair to describe him as a Nazi an actual out note Nazi. Yeah, very much. A lot of his ideas are parallel. Yeah. And so he was too much for Alex too much of a Nazi for Alex. And so he didn't do the fourth hour anymore, and instead was in his compound in Idaho, where he would drunkenly sit around a fire and livestream anti semitic shit to a smallish audience of people who would call him Big Bear.

And then one of the things that I will say not to his credit, not a positive about Owen Benjamin, but something that I find entertaining. Yeah, is that he's a guy who doesn't give a fuck. Like when the Internet is bad that intellectual darkweb decided to disown him. Yeah, he put out a video talking about how much they're a bunch of shitheads. And how like, they all worship Sam Harris and his parents made Golden Girls and he's just living off a silver spoon. This fucking rich asshole. Like, so. Like, he burns people. Yeah, yeah. And after he and Alex had a falling out. He was like, This guy's a fucking alcoholic liar. Yeah, everything because he's just so full of shit. Yeah. And so So now he's back. And I think I could succinctly through what I've just said, Yeah. Sort of support my claim that this is embarrassing for both of you. Yeah. They should not be talking don't do and if they are talking, they should probably be dealing with the fact that they both hate each other.

According to the National Rural Health Association, suicide rates in rural communities increased by 48%, between 2000 to 2018, compared with 34%, in urban areas, there is a lot of depression and mental health issues that get ignored.

The whole the gasoline, because they buy everything else in their life. They put a plastic bag, well, this must be good. You know, it eats fruit about 10 seconds. And the video that the media when interviewed the woman because they saw her license plate that was trying to charge the Tesla. But she said, Well, I just bought the car and I was tired that day. Now I put women now to just mainly these are women doing this. These are real videos. What a lot of men are like this too, but women particularly on average, it's that part of the graph that's really high, do not understand anything operates, but are the most likely to believe in the system because they're disconnected from it. So you have a farmer is the closest to reality because they're having to make it or break it or a rancher or you know, an oilfield worker. women's jobs mainly are now not to her children. And she's working in a corporate lollol. And I'm not singling women out. But how are they going to deal with the collapse of society? Because to me, that's frightening, because it's hard to keep civilization going. And if you even have a birth rate of 10 20%, but needs replacement rate of 2.2 you then collapse will notice replacement rate has collapsed. Oh and but the general public. I mean, I remember my dad's dad, my other grandfather was the basketballs if you know how to do basic stuff, your roof, the house and, you know, fix the stove, but my dad's dad had combines everything. And I remember him like taking Folgers cans and welding them on to fix parts you want to pay for him and like just like a mad demon like doing everything he can just walk out, shoot a squirrel and scan it in two minutes and fry it up for lunch. I mean, you name it a butcher account, like four hours just like a machine. Now think about a guy like that versus people. That's like a god compared to a monkey. I mean, it's not even. I can't imagine how about the brain trust that we've lost?
