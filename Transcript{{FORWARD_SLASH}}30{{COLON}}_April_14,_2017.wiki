    | text      = And here's what that entails. Schools must evaluate children who they suspect to have a disability classify their disability and develop an individualized education program or an IEP, describing the appropriate placement and services that will help the children meet grade level standards. Some IEPs prescribe minimal services or accommodations, such as additional time to complete assignments, while others include more intensive services, such as the support from a one on one aid, IEP is must be reevaluated on an annual basis to determine if the student's needs have evolved and new supports or services are required. This is part of the federal protections for disabled students. Yeah, this is one of the things that you wave away in a voucher program, you shouldn't wave that away. No, because it's very important. It's super important, because the idea of what a disabled student is, is also really vague. It could be someone with a mild behavioral problem, or it could be someone with Down syndrome. It could be someone in a wheelchair, there are all sorts of things that fall under that categorization. Now within the voucher programs, also, because it, you know, it makes it very difficult to deal with these students, because you have to create these IEPs these individual education programs, because the federal law demands that these public schools or I'm sorry, these private schools that you can get vouchers to get into can just deny students because we oh, this would be an undue burden to our school. We can handle this, or whatever. And they can just say, No, we don't, we don't want you. We do we can just reject you as a student, which is really scary. That's a really scary world that we could be entering into. And it's exactly what the person that Trump has made the Secretary of Education wants to do. It is it's his vision of education for the future. So Nigel McGuinness with your thing, there's like, Oh, my God, these people with disabilities are going to be screwed. They kind of are they? Absolutely. It's going to be a very difficult world. This is very concrete. This isn't this isn't some weird fear. This is based on fact is based on a rejection of the federal standards that are made in her confirmation hearing. So you seem to be unaware of these standards. She said that protections for disabled students should be handled on a state by state basis, not recognizing that these are federal mandates.

Like, that's exactly what they're doing. They're saying, oh, Islamic people want to be treated differently based on their cultural ideology and their belief system. And we think that that's evil, and everybody in America should be held to the same standardized American set of values, but at the same time, that American set of values should be separated between the federal government and the state's government. Which means really, what you're saying is that Alabama rights should be different from fucking Islamic right should be different from fucking Illinois right now.

It's not negotiable for them to be like, oh, yeah, let's get the pay gap. Get down. It's difficult for them to be like this has to be our number one issue, it's life and death. And then you have the African American community who were like, cops keep killing and beating the shit out of us when we do nothing. Agreed. And it's difficult to switch focus for them off of that.
