{{TranscriptBlock

    | text      = right? But but it was broadcast live, streamed it on like rumble or wherever she streams. So like that is that is a like exciting element of this. All right, anything can happen. It is live. Yes, there's no chaos. No. But one of the things that I kind of considered when we were listening to the first one was that I feel like Carrie might like not believe this, or Yes, or may because it seemed like it might be too much to incorporate. There were ideas that were far more to the left of her political ideology. Sure, sure, sure. And I was I thought she'd be like, add on believe this, but turns out all in he's the real deal all in

    | text      = it's, it's really great to have you on my show, again, thrilled to death, to to really do this kind of an interview. Because as far as I'm concerned, you know, you're the real thing. And I know we have some other people out there that have maybe skepticism, so maybe we can kind of go down that road a little bit and, you know, get rid of a few of their, their fears and skepticism and see if we can bring them round. But at any rate, major bird is this, we call these this series of the ambassador. And that refers to the What a great name watch that he or Yeti or you know, there's other names for them, of course, that is, in essence an extraterrestrial race of beings that are here on earth with us. And he can explain that.

    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 12:31
    | text      = So I think that Carrie is in Yeah, he definitely is saying he's the real deal. But there are some doubters. And I think that if you look at the comments, there are some people who are expressing like, I don't know about this. And I think it's because there is a mentality around all this stuff. Yeah, that exists in Project Camelot, and a lot of these paranormal or, you know, space conspiracy worlds. Sure, that has to do with that defining aliens by their race. Absolutely the pre like, it's determinative of your personality, your tendencies, right, and bucking, that is probably something that the audience doesn't really aren't ready for. Or maybe you have a tough time hearing and thinking is real?

It's just like, I can't meet everybody. So guess what I'm deciding all elves are the same today. That's what it is, you know, because I just I have nine friends, I know them by name.

    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 14:03
    | text      = Well, and I guess if you know, if there is non hatred, that is kind of just pervading this, this sort of mindset that does categorize, then that is the kind of person that probably would be much easier to grasp, but then someone who their opinions are backed by hate. And so maybe, maybe there's some potential there, but I don't know, it could take a bit to get the audience to accept this.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan

And so I find it difficult to categorize her any other way. Yeah, no, you're right. And when I say that he's more left, I mean, just more like in terms of seemingly more about civil rights. stuff. Yes. Maybe maybe things that that folks on the left are more generally treating

I've come back home, I've been permitted to come home with Squatch with the ambassador. He is currently he's been given some land. That is sub shirted, and two acres on it or drones keeping safe.

Other planets designed their AI, but our AI evolved spontaneously on the internet.

And then with the advent of virtual private networking, it was able to form more solid, repetitive neural feedback loops, and really develop true self awareness. And so the AI that has so much authority over military and space decisions and operates the Blackbird, satellite weapons platforms around Earth and Mars, that AI really was co opted by the military.

So Venus is different from Mars because you had go there and you're dealing with, you know, a planet that was colonized by the other side of the Iron Curtain. So there's, there's you know it Soviet colonialism, if you want to call it that, it's debatable whether you can call it a colonialism, but their their foreign policy was fundamentally different from The theory behind US foreign policy, I actually disagree with the term Soviet empire. I think Empire is a misnomer. There were certainly problematic aspects of their foreign policy. But on the whole, it seemed like they actually had more respect for autonomy of former colonial nations than the United States and our kind of sign of globalism has had, considering how many democratic elections the United States is overthrown in other parts of the world when they elect someone that we don't like.
