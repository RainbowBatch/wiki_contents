After the verdict came out on Thursday, we had the opportunity to sit down and chat with the plaintiff's attorney from the Texas cases. Mark Bankston about the you know the goings on to reflect a little bit on the the case and what were the most likely next steps. And that is a little bonus bonus bonus. That's what it is. It's a bonus little episode for this weekend for you all to enjoy. Sneaky snake and but here's the thing. Do me and Jordan had meant me up, man. I'm pronouncing things weird all over the place. Me and Jordan had meant to recorded an intro the like this what I'm what I'm doing here, but we forgot. Anyway, I just thought it would be weird if the episode started and then just immediately jumped into an interview. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Maybe this is unnecessary. Anyway, before I get too up in my head. I'll just throw it to the interviewer enjoy. And we will be talking to you soon. Well, folks, I figured there's a lot of news. There's a billion stories to cover. Yeah. 965 million to be exact. Yeah, close to a billion stories. Yeah. And whenever we need some legal analysis on cases involving one Alex Emmerich Jones, there's, there's one when we put up the mark Bankston symbol, there's

    | text      = and, I mean, here's the other thing, too, is I had, over the years gotten the chance to reach out and talk to some of the other plaintiffs in the Lafferty case, but this was the first time that I'm like, in a room with them all, and got to meet them. And, you know, it's weird because sometimes people that you don't think about it too much, that in a very technical sense, these cases of ours in Connecticut, in in Texas are in competition in a way like that. That would normally be the case. Right? But that has since almost the outset. Not been how we've treated it. Yeah. And these parents were so gracious to me. And so I mean, they were expressing their admiration and their thanks for what we did. And I don't even represent these folks. Right. But we've kind of stopped looking at it that way. Because, you know, I think we've said it in court many times, me and Chris are as cooperative as to plaintiff's lawyers across the country can ever be. And we have helped each other along this way to make sure that these people are not pulling fast ones in either direction. And so man, when that trial started, yeah, there was no other place in the world. I wanted to be try to help whatever way I could. And it was, it was a great experience to be there. And to be, I don't know, there was something about that particular courtroom and you have that amount of gravity of people in it. Yeah, of all of these plaintiffs. It was, it was quite an experience. But you know, like, like, a lot of people midway through the trial, and I had to leave and come home, because I actually had to come home for a couple days, and then go try another case at Kansas City. Nobody really knew what was gonna happen. Right. Nobody really knew.

    | text      = that was I mean, look, I'll be honest with you, once, once Alex testified, I kind of knew where we were going, just not the degree, right. Like, nobody knows. I've always said this getting nobody knows how to value these cases. Right. And so I was almost concerned after my case, if people were going to look at it and go, All right, well, yeah, but that's just a total fluke, you've got one story of what happened to with neon, Scarlet where Neil gets to fame, and you get one result. That's just a fluke. And what's so rewarding about this next trial? Is it proves that's not a fluke. There's no fluke about it. Yeah. And that you can almost look at that. It's like the Heslin case is sort of the battering ram that breaks into that fortress sets the value sets understands how the case is going to go. And then Chris and his team just took that. And I mean, look, there's there was a lot of things that were going off. Right. To start this prefaces, there were a lot of really good things.

    | text      = yeah. Right. And so I think everybody knew that wasn't going to be what was happening, because I mean, I mean, I think what these cases show, and I knew from when he testified, is a jury Once this information is put in front of them, it is basically indispensable on its merits, they're gonna fucking hate the guy. That's just how it's gonna be. And then then the question is, right, like so look, they have all these things going well, for them, they have the first trial with Jones that we had in Austin clearly broke his brain. Right, he came to that trial with the defense lawyer who was going to put on a fairly standard defense. He went in there and pretended that he had remorse. They tried to play the script of how you would supposedly defend this. And they got they got wrecked. And so it broke Alex's brain. So he shows up to the next trial, and he acts like a goddamn madman. He's up there on the stand said I don't apologize for shit and basically like an old enemy.

You know, I think it's sometimes works in a criminal trial when you have a lawyer who's defending who is deeply and fundamentally unlikable like norm is I mean, it's just a powerfully unlikable human being. But it actually sometimes works in criminal trials. But in the civil end, no, this would didn't fly. So you've got all these advantages go and then you got Jones, you've got the attorney. I mean, it's a mess. But here's the thing that I don't think people are putting enough attention on, is that while Chris petty had himself a really strong case, and really favorable conditions in the courtroom, he faced something that is so insanely difficult, which is when you have when you just have a win, it's just Neelam Scarlets one fan, right, you can get the number up, get it up there to 50 million and you're in your jury understands that. But once you start having 15 plaintiffs, you have to get the numbers up so high that your juries gonna get sticker shock, right. And that's a worry even well below the finger, they got to be able to defeat that, to be able to get a jury on board with the idea of of giving this kind of award is literally the hardest thing a plaintiff's lawyer can ever do.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 11:06
    | text      = I believe it. I think, I think in terms of that, that's, that's an angle and then to with the the number of plaintiffs like as opposed to with your case, with Neil and Scarlett, it's, you know, it's one story. It may be a complicated story to tell, but with so many plaintiffs being able to, you know, respectfully and accurately convey all of their different experiences, right. It's something that I thought was also well handled. Yeah. It seems like a gigantic challenge. Yeah.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mark Bankston
    | timestamp = 11:36
    | text      = I mean, look, you you know, you're going to if you do it, right, like he did you get critical mass up. Yeah, that can happen. But there was a huge danger there of losing the jury and the details of all of these different people, and having them get exhausted through the process and having that be doled in their senses. And you'll notice that as Chris started going through the different plaintiffs, he was able to create new angles and new ways to tell the story. Yes, it wasn't just repetitive.

    | text      = Yeah. The other person I should probably mentioned by name just because I'm such such a big fan of hers is Eleanor Sterling's work, arguing legal propositions in that courtroom was so outstanding. I really have rarely seen a lawyer who was so effective at communicating with the judge than Eleanor is, and there were so many big rulings that she was able to secure during that trial. And she did such an amazing job. They had a really great team. I mean, that's it was both of these parents, both sides have, we're lucky to have really competent representation because they could have gotten stuck with terrible people. You never know. Like, norm.

Their legal team had three very distinctive and different personality presences in the courtroom, right then that some people look at the four of us, for instance, and it's like, yeah, the four bearded weirdos you know, they've they're basically brothers. They're, they're, they're different shades of the same color.

    | text      = That's exactly right. And but there is sort of a solidarity, that goodness that we almost operate as one unit. And it's an interesting way to do it, and truly seem to really like us for it. But then when you add up into that it could adopt this different approach of having Alright, so Chris has is able to bring a level of moral righteousness to the courtroom, that in a less genuine person would be over the top. But Chris is so genuine, that he was able to keep this like very strong sense of moral authority in the courtroom, but that needed to be counterbalanced because that they needed to have an emotional angle to they needed to have a humanistic relating. And Josh Casa pulled that element off of it. He has such an easy, unforced sense of camaraderie with people that he can pull that off. And then you have Eleanor who is basically a strategist at heart like she is a As a battlefield general, and to know how to use the rules to keep her opponent where she wants, and so you have this very analytical approach, and Eleanor and the three of them together, just knocked it out of the park. I just, I'm, I'm actually super excited to work with them again in the future, you know, because they are some, they have been doing some great work outside of this too, you know, because they did Remington and that was a long slog, a very uphill climb. And they did it. And so they're out, you know, celebrating the world right now getting the accolades, and they deserve every bit of it. Because, wow, this is really an amazing result. Yeah,

He has put his company into bankruptcy, or at least freeze dried up systems is in bankruptcy. And there's some sort of chaos going on with that as well, with the lawyers turning on each other a little bit as well. But where do Where do you I mean, obviously, is into almost entirely unpredictable. But where do you get, like, what are we talking about when we talk about appeals? Well, it's one of the options even,

    | text      = there was a there was a clip that came out of me talking in the courthouse right after our verdict came down. And I made some predictions on this subject about picking, dividing up the courts of Infowars. Yeah, follows me like it goes to wherever I go. There was the thought that look, if these verdicts aren't monstrously big like they are right now, that that this would end up with resolution through bankruptcy court, because Jones wants this over, he's not going to chase to the ends of the earth on this kind of stuff. And it wouldn't make sense to like, look, he's going to have four trials to get them all overturned. It's just ridiculous. So and I figured that he would, they would, we wouldn't be looking at that situation. In other words, we would be looking at this Indian in a different way. But now when you've got a billion dollar judgment, you've got the Texas verdict, which I know they think they can appeal. Right? And then they're gonna have two more, Alex's just decided to just screw it. And like he said the other day on the show. Uh, you know, I'm gonna spend a few $100,000 and keep these cases wrapped up for years. Yeah. Care. Like you think I care about that? Like, like, like, Warren, I think you're vastly overestimating how difficult to plaintiff side appeal is like, I've got to write two briefs over the next two years. No big

Let's say that by some heaven forbid chance he is successful on appeal against us, for instance, and Texas Court of Appeals or Texas Supreme Court, reverses and orders a new trial to go forward.

The jury pool is all going to know about this billion dollar verdict. I mean, this thing, not the right, exactly. And so a lot of those people who do know about it are probably going to get kicked off the jury. Right? Yeah. So we're gonna have a jury who's, who's less in touch with what's been going on with Alex Jones. And what I've learned through this process is that is perhaps more advantageous, right? Totally, totally. People who don't know this shit, and they get exposed to it. They lose their fucking minds. Dare you?

And for us, that's about 30 days to file notices of Appeals and the various state courts. And if they want to do that, then they'll get an appeal. Like, for instance, I'll just take my case, though, they'll go up to the Texas Court of Appeals, and then that court will rule on everything that will probably take and nine months, something like that. And then there will be they'll probably appeal after that. They'll do a what they call a petition for review to the Texas Supreme Court. That's not a mandatory appeal. The Texas Supreme Court gets to decide whether they want to hear it or not sure. And in the past, they declined to hear in the earlier appeal, so I don't I don't know. But that would probably if the tech Supreme Court takes it, that's another nine months. And then and then they'll petition to the US Supreme Court that will resolve itself quickly.

Like, I'll make videos, I'll do whatever people like, yeah, like, you're not going to get rid of them that way. Either way you really have to do is to be able to marginalize and neuter his influence on American culture. Right? And that that really is kind of the goal, the whole thing, right? When these families realize that men they start to see that Parkland shooting happened, same stuff was happening, they're like, we can't just let this keep going. The suit itself, you gotta remember a suit gets filed in April. Lafferty suit pulls up a couple months later, Jones basically loses his mind over that period of time starts threatening to kill Robert Moeller starts posting just a bunch of stuff that like is like an attempt to get the tech giants to come after Mr. Most racist transphobic shit, and you know, all sorts of stuff. During that summer, he loses his mind, the combination of those two events, the lawsuit, and all of that caused the tech giants to D platform, which I still think was done in the most ridiculous, arbitrary way that kind of like points to their mistakes all through it, but like it got done. Right. And that was the first big effect of the suit. I really do think that you move past 2019 at 2018. Jones was basically at the height of his powers. And he was effectively defamed by the suit itself, then the deep platforming reduces the core size of his audience. And then now after the defaults, after all of it, after this constant drumbeat of how he's not taking it seriously, and then the verdicts, he has been heavily marginalized as in in a way that like, I'm not even sure that collecting the money makes that much more of a difference to tell you the truth. I mean, I think it will reduce the size of his media operation, but but his ultimate reach, I think, will probably be about the same margins.

But then there's logistical things of like credit impacts of losing a case like these, and that's something that will will be a problem for him and In order to maintain whatever relevance he has, and ability to get audience, he has to have his own site like bamdad video that is intensely expensive for him with bandwidth costs. And the only way to keep getting people to go to the site is to offer a platform for weirdos like David Icke, and some of these other folks like that guy who dresses up like Uncle Sam and yells at people on the street. Like you, he has that stuff. And that's costing him an arm and a leg.

If if a prosecutor had the balls to do it, he could have prosecuted for this. But the thing that we're going to be talking about on the 20th of this month, is that because that conduct was criminal, and all of the allegations were found by default, that's gonna get us around the punitive damage cap. Wow, that's a good little act. There's no punitive damage cap for that. And so here, yeah, it is definitely going to be our argument in court on the 20 if that Jones committed a felony in this act, and that he very well could have been prosecuted.

Even though embarrassed as attorney was really, you know, rewarding in its own way. It makes all these late night shows just dissolve that you get this sort of feeling from it. But you know that it's just you're just opening the door on this whole, the final chapter, right? We said at the end of that Trump is the beginning of the end, right? There's still, like so much to see that didn't happen with a sequel that sets literally a record setting verdict, right, like, and that feels good to know. And to know, he's got two more Sydney. And I think something that some people haven't even really thought about it in this equation is that many Posner and Verity calorosa, their damages, direct damage from this are probably the most outrageous of anybody involved in this. Yeah. And for a long duration that that it really is he's got that last one he's looking at there is really, really threatening. And then look, even even with Marcel's case, which didn't have like the years long effect, is still really repugnant. And he's very possibly facing a big verdict there as well. And so you're gonna have some more of this. But the fact that the fact is, is we filed our suits near each other. In the library, people came a couple of months after mine. And then over the course of these four years, even with the procedural differences in the case, we basically stayed neck and neck. And so to have it come down to even after all the appeals aren't trials are like a month apart, to have this one two punch. It's like the story being told, it's amazing. It couldn't have worked out any better. It really is. And, and that kind of brings you back to another point, I think it's super important that people need to realize and that needs to get said more by people can say the sorts of things of like, oh, Alex Jones could have put on a First Amendment offense, but but he chose not to participate and therefore got defaulted. So he didn't get to do that. And that's actually not sure is that in the beginnings of the case, in both states, he was allowed to bring an anti slap motion that challenges his first amendment rights and all of that stuff. And he actually had all of that heard on the merits. He had appeals up to the Texas Court of Appeals, and up to the Texas Supreme Court, you can go read like one of them, it's really spells it all out really nice as the positive versus Jones opinion from the Texas Court of Appeals. And they go through these issues, all of the First Amendment things that he would want, he had every chance to do that he got a fair shake in court to do that. It wasn't until he came back from that, and still over the years, but just didn't participate, that that's when he ended up getting defaulted on the merits to trial. So he got to try to vindicate his first amendment rights, and it failed it because this, this has nothing to do with the first of them and you know, false facts about identifiable people,

And it was, if our judges had done that early off in 2019, that would have been more effective than an argument for him to make. But but he didn't get to do that. And the fact is, is these First Amendment issues were tested, and I had to brief my ass off on them, and we beat him on. And that's what got us to the place that we are, and not that he was denied any of his fundamental constitutional rights or anything like that. I mean, it's a ridiculous thing for him to say,

And there was nothing that required Chris to say, under his protective order with the court that the documents that he gets that he went to the court and actually asked for a provision in the protective order to allow to him to share those documents with me if he got stuck. He didn't have to do that. There was there was and there would be a lot of people in different cases where they weren't on the same page that wouldn't do that. Right.

I wanted it to be over on the t shirt again. I'm probably not gonna be able to do that. But but it's looking like early next year. I'm hoping for January, February, something like that.
