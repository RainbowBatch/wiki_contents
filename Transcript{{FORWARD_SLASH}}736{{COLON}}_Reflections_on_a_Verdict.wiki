Here's the situation, the other day me and Jordan, after the verdict came out on Thursday, we had the opportunity to sit down and chat with the plaintiff's attorney from the Texas cases, Mark Bankston, about the, you know the goings on, reflect a little bit on the the case and what were the most likely next steps. And that is a little bowonus, bwonus bowonus. That's what it is. It's a bonus little episode for this weekend for you all to enjoy. Sneaky snaking. But here's the thing. Me and Jordan had myint, mint, man. I'm pronouncing things weird all over the place. Me and Jordan had meant to record an intro the like this what I'm what I'm doing here, but we forgot. Anyway, I just thought it would be weird if the episode started and then just immediately jumped into an interview. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Maybe this is unnecessary. Anyway, before I get too up in my head. I'll just throw it to the interview, enjoy, and we will be talking to you soon.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mark Bankston
    | timestamp = 00:04:28.000
    | text      = Yeah, exactly, I mean, here's the other thing, too, is I had, over the years gotten the chance to reach out and talk to some of the other plaintiffs in the Lafferty case, but this was the first time that I'm like, in a room with them all, and got to meet them. And, you know, it's weird because sometimes people that you don't think about it too much, that in a very technical sense, these cases of ours in Connecticut, and in Texas are in competition in a way like that. That would normally be the case. Right? But that has since almost the outset, not been how we've treated it. Yeah. And these parents were so gracious to me. And so I mean, they were expressing their admiration and their thanks for what we did. And I don't even represent these folks. Right? But we've kind of stopped looking at it that way. Because, you know, I think we've said it in court many times, me and Chris are as cooperative as two plaintiff's lawyers across the country could ever be. And we have helped each other along this way to make sure that these people are not pulling fast ones in either direction. And so man, when that trial started, yeah, there was no other place in the world I wanted to be, try to help whatever way I could. And it was, it was a great experience to be there. And to be, I don't know, there was something about that particular courtroom when you have that amount of gravity of people in it. yeah. Of all of these plaintiffs. It was, it was quite an experience. But you know, like, like, a lot of people midway through the trial, and I had to leave and come home, because I actually had to come home for a couple days and then go try another case out in Kansas City. Nobody really knew what was gonna happen. Right? Nobody really knew.

    | timestamp = 00:06:04.000
    | text      = That was I mean, look, I'll be honest with you, once, once Alex testified, I kind of knew where we were going, just not the degree, right. Like, nobody knows. I've always said this getting nobody knows how to value these cases. Right? And so I was almost concerned after my case, if people were going to look at it and go, All right, well, yeah, but that's just a total fluke, you've got one story of what happened to with Neil and Scarlet where Neil gets defamed, and you get one result. That's just a fluke. And what's so rewarding about this next trial? Is it proves that's not a fluke. There's no fluke about it. yeah. And that you can almost look at that. It's like the Heslin case is sort of the battering ram that breaks into that fortress, sets the value sets understands how the case is going to go. And then Chris and his team just took that. And I mean, look, there's there was a lot of things that were going well for them. Right? To start, let's preface this, there were a lot of really good things.

    | text      = There can be a lot of defendants who got defaulted or came in there with just a damage hearing. And it still it doesn't really matter, because it's still if the jury doesn't think what they did was wrong, then they're not going to compensate people for it. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 00:07:21.000
    | text      = And that idea of getting $1. You know, well, like when Trump sued the NFL, and they gave him a fucking dollar, you know, yeah.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mark Bankston
    | timestamp = 00:07:28.000
    | text      = Right? And so I think everybody knew that wasn't going to be what was happening, because I mean, I mean, I think what these cases show, and I knew from when he testified, is a jury, once this information is put in front of them, it is basically indispensable on its merits, they're gonna fucking hate the guy. That's just how it's gonna be. And then then the question is, right, like so look, they have all these things going well for them, they have the first trial with Jones that we had in Austin clearly broke his brain. Right, he came to that trial with a defense lawyer who was going to put on a fairly standard defense. He went in there and pretended that he had remorse. They tried to play the script of how you would supposedly defend this. And they got they got wrecked. And so it broke Alex's brain. So he shows up to the next trial, and he acts like a goddamn madman. He's up there on the stand saying, I don't apologize for shit, and basically like, all of you are my enemy.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Mark Bankston
    | timestamp = 00:10:05.000
    | text      = You know, I think it's sometimes works in a criminal trial when you have a lawyer who's defending, who is deeply and fundamentally unlikable like Norm is, I mean, he's just a powerfully unlikable human being. But it actually sometimes works in criminal trials. But in the civil end, no, this would didn't fly. So you've got all these advantages going in, then you got Jones, you've got the attorney. I mean, it's a mess. But here's the thing that I don't think people are putting enough attention on, is that while Chris Mattei had himself a really strong case, and really favorable conditions in the courtroom, he faced something that is so insanely difficult, which is when you have, when you just have, when  it's just Neil and Scarlet, one family, right, you can get the number up, get it up there to 50 million and your jury understands that. But once you start having 15 plaintiffs, you have to get the numbers up so high that your jury's gonna get sticker shock, right. And that's a worry even well below the figure they got. To be able to defeat that, to be able to get a jury on board with the idea of of giving this kind of award is literally the hardest thing a plaintiff's lawyer can ever do.

    | timestamp = 00:11:08.000
    | text      = I think, I think in terms of that, that's, that's an angle and then too with the the number of plaintiffs like as opposed to with your case, with Neil and Scarlett, it's, you know, it's one story. It may be a complicated story to tell, but with so many plaintiffs being able to, you know, respectfully and accurately convey all of their different experiences. right. It's something that I thought was also well handled. yeah. It seems like a gigantic challenge. yeah.

    | text      = I mean, look, you you know, you're going to, if you do it, right, like he did you get critical mass. Yeah, that can happen. But there was a huge danger there of losing the jury in the details, of all of these different people, and having them get exhausted through the process and having that be dulled in their senses. And you'll notice that as Chris started going through the different plaintiffs, he was able to create new angles and new ways to tell the story. yes. It wasn't just repetitive. yeah. At all.

    | text      = Yeah. The other person I should probably mention by name just because I'm such such a big fan of hers is Alinor Sterling's work, arguing legal propositions in that courtroom was so outstanding. I really have rarely seen a lawyer who was so effective at communicating with the judge than Alinor is, and there were so many big rulings that she was able to secure during that trial. And she did such an amazing job. They had a really great team. I mean, that's it was both of these parents, both sides have, we're lucky to have really competent representation because they could have gotten stuck with terrible people. You never know. like Norm.

    | text      = Exactly, right. And but there is sort of a solidarity, that groupness that we almost operate as one unit. And it's an interesting way to do it, and the jury seemed to really like us for it. But then when you add up into that it could adopt this different approach of having. Alright, so Chris has is able to bring a level of moral righteousness to the courtroom, that in a less genuine person would be over the top. But Chris is so genuine, that he was able to keep this like very strong sense of moral authority in the courtroom, but that needed to be counterbalanced because that they needed to have an emotional angle to they needed to have a humanistic relating. And Josh Koskoff pulled that element off of it. He has such an easy, unforced sense of camaraderie with people that he can pull that off. And then you have Alinor who is basically a strategist at heart like she is a, a battlefield general, and to know how to use the rules to keep her opponent where she wants, and so you have this very analytical approach in Alinor and the three of them together, just knocked it out of the park. I just, I'm, I'm actually super excited to work with them again in the future, you know, because they are some, they have been doing some great work outside of this too, you know, because they did Remington and that was a long slog, a very uphill climb. And they did it. And so they're out, you know, celebrating the world right now getting the accolades, and they deserve every bit of it. Because, wow, this is really an amazing result. Yeah, totally.

There was the thought that look, if these verdicts aren't monstrously big like they are right now, that that this would end up with resolution through bankruptcy court, because Jones wants this over, he's not going to chase to the ends of the earth on this kind of stuff. And it wouldn't make sense to like, look, he's going to have four trials, to get them all overturned? It's just ridiculous. So and I figured that he would, they would, we wouldn't be looking at that situation. In other words, we would be looking at this ending in a different way. But now when you've got a billion dollar judgment, you've got the Texas verdict, which I know they think they can appeal. Right? And then they're gonna have two more, Alex has just decided to just screw it. And like he said the other day on the show. Uh, you know, I'm gonna spend a few $100,000 and keep these cases wrapped up for years. yeah. And I'm like, I don't care. Like you think I care about that? Like, like, like, one, I think you're vastly overestimating how difficult a plaintiff side appeal is like, I've got to write two briefs over the next two years. Oh, big deal.

Infowars has about 30 days to file notices of Appeals in the various state courts. And if they want to do that, then they'll get an appeal. Like, for instance, I'll just take my case, though, they'll go up to the Texas Court of Appeals, and then that court will rule on everything, that will probably take and nine months, something like that. And then there will be they'll probably appeal after that. They'll do a what they call a petition for review to the Texas Supreme Court. That's not a mandatory appeal. The Texas Supreme Court gets to decide whether they want to hear it or not. sure. And in the past, they declined to hear in the earlier appeal, so I don't I don't know. But that would probably if the tech Supreme Court takes it, that's another nine months. And then and then they'll petition to the US Supreme Court that will resolve itself quickly.

There already are immediate effects that I think are, because because here's the thing, even if you could take all of his money, and you could essentially shut down Infowars, that's not going to stop him from being him like, it'll be on the internet. Like, he'll make videos, he'll do whatever people like, yeah, like, you're not going to get rid of them that way. What you really have to do is to be able to marginalize and neuter his influence on American culture. Right? And that that really is kind of the goal, the whole thing, right? When these families realize that man, they start to see that Parkland shooting happened, same stuff was happening, they're like, we can't just let this keep going. The suit itself, you gotta remember a suit gets filed in April. Lafferty suit pulls up a couple months later, Jones basically loses his mind over that period of time, starts threatening to kill Robert Mueller, starts posting just a bunch of stuff that like is like an attempt to get the tech giants to come after him, just the most racist, transphobic shit, and you know, all sorts of stuff. During that summer, he loses his mind, the combination of those two events, the lawsuit, and all of that caused the tech giants to deplatform, which I still think was done in the most ridiculous, arbitrary way that kind of like points to their mistakes all through it, but like it got done. Right. And that was the first big effect of the suit. I really do think that you move past 2019, at 2018 Jones was basically at the height of his powers. And he was effectively defanged by the suit itself, then the deplatforming reduces the core size of his audience. And then now after the defaults, after all of it, after this constant drumbeat of how he's not taking it seriously, and then the verdicts, he has been heavily marginalized as in in a way that like, I'm not even sure that collecting the money makes that much more of a difference to tell you the truth. I mean, I think it will reduce the size of his media operation, but but his ultimate reach, I think, will probably be about the same...margins.

And I think that could be helpful in some ways. yeah. But then there's logistical things of like credit impacts of losing a case like these, and that's something that will will be a problem for him and in order to maintain whatever relevance he has, and ability to get audience, he has to have his own site like Banned dot video that is intensely expensive for him with bandwidth costs. And the only way to keep getting people to go to the site is to offer a platform for weirdos like David Icke, and some of these other folks like that guy who dresses up like Uncle Sam and yells at people on the street. Like you, he has that stuff. And that's costing him an arm and a leg. And eventually, he's not going to be able to afford to run this site, and other people aren't going to pony up the money for that.

And I think it's going to the effect on other people who are, who are edging close to, I might do some things like Alex Jones, this has given them considerable pause.

And these parents at the time that he committed these injuries were suffering from severe emotional disturbance, that makes them disabled under Texas law, these acts were illegal. If if a prosecutor had the balls to do it, he could have prosecuted for this.

And so you're gonna have some more of this. But the fact that the fact is, is we filed our suits near each other. The Lafferty people came a couple of months after mine. And then over the course of these four years, even with the procedural differences in the case, we basically stayed neck and neck. And so to have it come down to even after all the appeals, our trials are like a month apart, to have this one two punch. It's like the story being told, it's amazing. It couldn't have worked out any better. It really is. And, and that kind of brings you back to another point, I think it's super important that people need to realize and that needs to get said more by, people can say the sorts of things of like, oh, Alex Jones could have put on a First Amendment offense, but but he chose not to participate and therefore got defaulted. So haha, he didn't get to do that. And that's actually not true in that in the beginnings of the case, in both states, he was allowed to bring an anti SLAP motion that challenges his First Amendment rights and all of that stuff. And he actually had all of that heard on the merits. He had appeals up to the Texas Court of Appeals, and up to the Texas Supreme Court, you can go read like one of them that really spells it all out really nice as the Pozner versus Jones opinion from the Texas Court of Appeals. And they go through these issues, all of the First Amendment things that he would want, he had every chance to do that he got a fair shake in court to do that. It wasn't until he came back from that, and still over years, but just didn't participate, that that's when he ended up getting defaulted on the merits at trial. So he got to try to vindicate his First Amendment rights, and it failed. Because this, this has nothing to do with the First Amendment, you cannot tell false facts about identifiable people,

And it was, if our judges had done that early off in 2019, that would have been more effective than an argument for him to make. But but he didn't get to do that. And the fact is, is these First Amendment issues were tested, and I had to brief my ass off on them, and we beat him on them. And that's what got us to the place that we are, and not that he was denied any of his fundamental constitutional rights or anything like that. I mean, it's a ridiculous thing for him to say,

And was able to just and so you have these synergies between the case they had, you'll notice that in my case, in mine, we played deposition testimony. And half the depositions that we played were from Lafferty. You know, like it's interesting, Chris Mattei made an appearance in my trial, so did Matt Blumenthal, by questioning these witnesses. yeah.
