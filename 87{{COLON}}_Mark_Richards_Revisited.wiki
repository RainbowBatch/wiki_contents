Today, Dan and Jordan take a break from talking about Alex Jones because there is big news in the world: Project Camelot's Kerry Cassidy took a 7th visit to "interview" Mark Richards (either a Space Command pilot or responsible for a murder, depending on who you ask).

Tune in to catch up on Raptor News, learn about the AI spacecraft known as Minerva, and discover the secrets of the Spider Leadership.
