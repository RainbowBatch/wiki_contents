So I believe he is in Fort Lauderdale or somewhere in Florida. And so Alex was there and then he was spotted in Omaha because his wife's family lives in Omaha. And they from what I understand from like a court thing he was out of town because his father in law was ill, very ill. And so he's been doing like some fish show out of like a, like a downgraded studio sheriff. And it's just it doesn't have a lot of charm to it. It's it was very hard for me to you know, in the state you're in where you know, things are kind of chaotic and a mess in your head. Yeah, sometimes hard to work.

But like, you know, sitting down and watching him like, it is fake studio toes, fake secondary studio, and knowing like, Oh, you're just went down to Florida to, you know, do all this shit. This is pretending this bankruptcy isn't hanging over your head. You know, it's that that is a struggle. Yeah. No, I get it. And so I didn't. I didn't find a whole lot that charmed me in the present day. So this has basically just been a long winded way of saying we're in the past. We are in the past.

Because we say here we have a book or we have a video you can make copies of it too. We're suddenly bad but but but forget that argument. The other argument was You know, you're no leader you need to call for violence will notice the people always doing and I remember, people will tell militia leaders to do that they'd sit there in the shadows and do it. The Militia leaders shoot their mouth off, the Feds would grab them. And then suddenly the person who told him to do it would jump up and be in the article long time and the format said that he recorded the violence statements. It's always the long time and form it. So they know we're winning peaceably. They know we're hurting them and exposing their crimes. So they want to get us to prematurely move with violence.
