[[File:Ted Anderson.jpg|thumb]]
'''Ted Anderson''' is a former gold-salesman from Minnesota who is largely responsible for [[Alex Jones]] having a career.

Having begun his career in gold/precious metals sales around 1980, in 1998 Ted started his own operation called [[Midas Resources]]. He almost immediately started a radio syndication company, [[Genesis Communications Network]] (GCN). The two companies are functionally the same company, or more accurately, GCN is the marketing department of Midas Resources. Ted Anderson once described it this way<ref>https://fair.org/extra/alex-jones-and-the-informational-vacuum/</ref>:

"They actually work hand-in-hand. One fits like a glove. They're partnership-type businesses; Midas Resources needs customers, Genesis Communications Network needs sponsors."

Very early into the life of GCN, Ted Anderson began courting voices he felt could best market his gold and precious metals. He became a sponsor of Alex Jones' show on KJFK, and when Alex got fired from the station, Ted offered him a place on his radio network. Alex was fired from KJFK on Dec. 10, 1999, but clearly Alex was working for Ted before that, as evidenced from the header of Alex's website from Oct. 9, 1999<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19991009085521/http:/infowars.com:80/</ref>.

Over the years, Ted Anderson used Alex Jones' program to transmute an audiences' fear into gold-sales. The two men even had a routine they would pull out in order to maximize sales. Their technique would go like this:

*Alex would have a seemingly unrelated guest on the show, who is always presented as an economic expert. This role would often be filled by [[Bob Chapman]], but when he was not available, sometimes [[Gerald Celente]] or [[Peter Schiff]] have filled in.
*Alex would interview this "guest" about how the economy was ''just about'' to collapse, and that it was only a matter of time before the "[[Globalists]]" decide to destroy the value of the dollar.
*Somewhere along the way, both Alex and the guest would inevitably say that the only safe thing to do is buy gold. They always say that gold's price would be higher, if only the nefarious "Globalists" weren't artificially holding down the prices, something they absolutely can't do for much longer. In fact, they will often even say that the artificial manipulation of gold prices will end as soon as next week, so of course, you need to buy gold now before it's too late.
*Once this card has been played, Alex calls in Ted Anderson to close the deal. He will come on the show, pretending that wasn't the plan all along, and rattle off his specials. Everything is the best deal you'll ever find, everything is always running out.

This game is played out repeatedly, and presumably, Ted made a lot of money off it.

== Appearance on Alex's show on 9/11 ==

On the day of 9/11, Ted made a disgusting and exploitative appearance on Alex's show to sell gold (see [[703: 9/11, Part 1|Episode #703: 9/11, Part 1]]). In it, he played up fears of a financial collapse because some of the victims were involved in the financial system, and even noted that if there was gold stored in the WTC, it would be possible to dig it out of the rubble (unlike paper currency). Selling your product by fear mongering with the rubble of the twin towers on the day they fell is a choice that really tells you everything you need to know about Ted's character.

== Legal Trouble ==

On September 11, 2015, Ted Anderson began a court proceeding that would result in his license to sell gold and precious metals being revoked by the state of Minnesota<ref>https://www.cards.commerce.state.mn.us/CARDS/security/search.do?documentId=%7bCE255B67-A977-49DD-98A1-6652FF270FC0%7d</ref>. He was ordered to pay full restitution to consumers he had defrauded, and he was "prohibited from being an owner, officer, member or shareholder" in any bullion company for two years.

In addition, he was required to pay $310,000 of the restitution immediately, and approximately $60,000 a month to the people he'd ripped off, until he'd made full restitution. If he failed to make a payment, he would incur an additional $100,000 fine. Put simply, Ted was in a bad way in late 2015, finding himself in the hole approximately $1 million, and having the state order him to cease and desist from doing the thing he did to make money. Undoubtedly, the timing of Alex Jones' 2015 [[Money Bomb]] being held on September 16 (where they ended up raising almost exactly what Ted needed to pay off his victims) was completely unrelated<ref>https://www.infowars.com/infowars-money-bomb-2015-lets-take-back-our-republic/</ref>.

The loss of his license was the culmination of the Minnesota Commerce Actions and Regulatory Department receiving numerous complaints about Midas Resources. Upon review, it was determined that:

"MRI [Midas Resources Inc.], Anderson and Huebner engaged in acts and practices that demonstrate they are incompetent, financially irresponsible, and otherwise unqualified to act under the authority of the Commissioner.""MRI [Midas Resources Inc.], Anderson and Huebner engaged in acts and practices that demonstrate they are incompetent, financially irresponsible, and otherwise unqualified to act under the authority of the Commissioner."

They found further:

"MRI regularly misappropriated money received in the course of buying, selling, soliciting, or marketing bullion coins or investments in bullion coins to consumers in violation of Minnesota statutes.

MRI routinely failed without prior agreement to deliver bullion coins to its customers within 30 days of payment and otherwise misrepresented to consumers the terms of sale and delivery date of bullion coins.

Anderson and Huebner misappropriated a customer's money and otherwise misrepresented terms of sale and delivery dates."

This is not the first time Ted Anderson was in trouble with the law over the dealings of Midas Resources. In 2006, he was sued by a man named Stephen Papol, who alleged that he entered into a scheme with Midas Resources, who then proceeded to defraud him<ref>https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mnd-0_05-cv-00599/pdf/USCOURTS-mnd-0_05-cv-00599-0.pdf</ref>. Papol told a detective that this is how he got involved with Midas:

"Back when I was going through a divorce, okay, I sold my house, okay, and I got referred to these people to buy the coins from them. They had told me that they were going to be able to lose this money, and you know, buy this private gold, and it was untraceable, so whatever, um, money I had to hide or anything, they can do it, because there's no documentation of this private gold...

Even if they wanted to come look for the money, they would never, if, you know, if the courts would come look for the money they would never find the money. Still kind of skeptical about the whole thing and â€˜cause I really, you know, I'm in New York and they're all the way in Minnesota."

Papol very clearly describes a plan that was hatched with a representative from Midas Resources in order to hide money from his wife while he was going through a divorce. Clearly, the person who referred Papol to Midas knew that Midas was the kind of company that was okay with committing this kind of fraud.

Initially, Papol purchased $455,700 in gold coins, and after Midas representatives told him his investment was gaining value, he bumped the total of his purchase up to $986,701 worth of coins. These transactions were made around December 2003. In January 2004, after Papol resolved his divorce settlement, he was told by Midas representatives that if he were to sell off his coins, he would lose over $400,000 in value, claiming "normal dealer mark-ups and market fluctuations."

This doesn't make a lot of sense, since gold was valued (prices per oz.) at $406.95 in December 2003, and it was worth $413.79 in January 2004<ref>https://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=gold&months=180</ref>. It seems pretty clear that Midas was just skimming.

Papol's lawsuit ultimately was flawed, largely because he was arguing that he was trying to commit a crime, and in the process of it, Midas committed a crime against him, which is a complicated place for the law. Regardless, the story that Papol tells and the allegations that he makes against Midas Resources sound exactly like tons of stories other customers have told of their interactions with Midas<ref>https://www.bbb.org/minnesota/business-reviews/precious-metal-dealers/midas-resources-inc-in-burnsville-mn-17005594/reviews-and-complaints</ref>.

"I found that Midas overcharged me with premium of over $4.20 per ounce which amounted to about $1000.00.<ref>https://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/midas-resources/eagan-minnesota-55121/midas-resources-infowars-midas-resources-owned-by-ted-anderson-and-alex-jones-steal-money-832360</ref>"

"He [a Midas salesman] ended up charging me 40% over spot for each gold coin.<ref>https://midas.pissedconsumer.com/midas-resources-scams-new-gold-silver-coin-investors-20110611242689.html</ref>"

Even people on the [[Ron Paul]] Forums are not thrilled with what Midas Resources is up to<ref>http://www.ronpaulforums.com/showthread.php?162055-Buying-metals-from-Midas-Resources</ref>.

== Political Activities ==

Ted Anderson has been a longtime supporter of Ron Paul, and even served as a Minnesota delegate for Paul in past elections.

His bio touts that he, through Midas Resources, has "been a Torch Bearer Supporter of the Campaign For Liberty (C4L) since it's inception." Campaign For Liberty is basically just a non-profit that sprung out of the ashes of Ron Paul's failed 2008 run for president. In April 2018, they held a rally where they gave away an AR-15 to fight back against the "nanny-statists who want to ban it."<ref>https://ktrh.iheart.com/content/2018-04-30-campaign-for-liberty-ar-15-giveaway/</ref>

Ted Anderson and Midas Resources created something called the Ron Paul Air Corps, a campaign of aerial advertisements for Paul during the 2008 election<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20080228185111/http:/www.ronpaulaircorps.com/</ref>.

For some reason, Ted Anderson was who RT (Russia Today) decided to interview about Ron Paul's 2012 campaign<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUMQbDBqB5M</ref>.
