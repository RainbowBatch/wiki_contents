Today, Dan and Jordan check in on Alex Jones' present day show to see how he's responding to troubling storm clouds gathering around his Hero President Trump. It turns out he's descended into into a fantasy world where "Patriots" are talking over the world and the "Globalists" are fighting back with polio. Also, Alex has one of the most severe meltdowns in recent memory because Gavin McInness won't play ball with his attempt to give him a pep talk.
