And the level of responsibility he's had over the years at Infowars. Exact editor at large title and like he writes the bulk of the material. Yeah. Like, yeah, he would have every negotiating chip available to him. 100% To be an employee should he want to be Yeah, so yeah, maybe maybe there is like a mutually advantageous reason for that?

And and that goes both directions. Like Paula can say something so fucking crazy that Alex would be able to distance himself. Hey, you've never actually worked here, man. I was just, which is stupid. But yeah,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 10:27
    | text      = so as we know, from listening back to the episodes of Infowars, from that stretch of time after the shooting at Sandy Hook, we know that Paul Joseph Watson did interview Professor James Tracy was a proponent of the crisis actors theory and did push back right, a little Yeah, it was it was muddy, it was a little bit mixed. In my opinion, there was a little bit too much leniency given to him. But at the same time, Paul did say I don't agree with these ideas, right. So to again, like I said, the thinnest of praise possible, right? does have that to be like I did say, I don't believe this, right. So they play a little clip of that. And this is really important, because what this does, in terms of the questioning, is to explicitly lay out that as early as like February 2013, people at Infowars, were aware that the parents and the family members were being harassed. Yes.

    | text      = in the clip that is played of Paul interviewing Tracy, even back then there's audio of Paul bringing up to James Tracy. Yeah, that people are being harassed to there's a large awareness of this. Oh, yeah. So also, uh, back in the early days, Leonard Posner's sent an email to Info Wars telling them, Hey, these people are harassing us. And they need to be reeled in. I used to be a fan of your show. But I think now I realized that a lot of these behaviors are being encouraged. Now, the response to that email from Infowars, was apparently written by Paul Joseph Watson. Later in Alex's deposition, there'll be some maybe insinuations that Alex wrote it with him chair, but it's unclear there. But in this deposition, it's clear that Paul wrote it himself.

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 13:18
    | text      = So now this is interesting here for one reason, and that is that this would give Alex a little bit of plausible deniability share, because the interview with James Tracy was done by Paul, maybe Alex, I'd say he never heard it. He didn't know about the talk about the harassing of the parents. Sure. Sure. Sure. And this. Paul was just like, I was the one who got that email. I wrote back to the guy, maybe Alex can pretend he never saw that. Yeah. And see if Alex screws that up later, naturally. So one of the things that the lawyers seem to want to press on is like, Guys, do you really think that what you did was okay. Do you think that would Infowars engaged in was all right?

{{TranscriptBlock

And House DJ right and Alex's cousin. Right. So Paul has received an email from Quantcast, the website ranking group, and this email was to inform him that Infowars had seen a large surge in traffic recently. And as a matter of policy that meant Quantcast was going to put a temporary hold on ranking Infowars in their charts. They build.

See, what this email tends to demonstrate is that people behind the scenes at Infowars had an awareness that the things that they were saying publicly about Sandy Hook were not true. This email joke, it offers a glimpse into the way that the tragedy was being discussed internally by people like Buckley, who is someone who, like I said, is in a managerial role and is related directly to Alex Yeah, he's obviously joking about this thing with Quantcast being conspiracy against them. And the use of crisis actors at Sandy Hook as the outrageous example in the joke that tends to imply that he considers it an instance of something that is markable. Yeah. One of the reasons that this is such an excellent line of approach is because the lawyers are able to combine private information they founded discovery with public statements.

Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah. Because what they've just laid out is that on the same day, a manager at Infowars, who's related to Alex was privately mocking Sandy Hook conspiracies, while simultaneously, Alex was promoting them on his show. This goes a really long way towards building the case that these people knew that what they were saying wasn't true. Earlier in the deposition, it was established that at least Paul was completely aware as early as the beginning of 2013, that the families of the victims are being harassed by people who believe these theories, which implies that the argument that they didn't know the consequences of their coverage, probably not true. And here you have a little glimpse of the behind the scenes vibe that really seems to suggest that the people at Infowars were aware that the information they were airing was worth mocking, which is to say not true. The pieces that come together out of this look really, really bad. Considering that this is not even close to all the information the plaintiffs are working with. It really seems like Alex is probably in some serious trouble. And this is all said and done. Oh, yeah. And Paul, I honestly think is probably play the playing this almost exactly like he should.

A company cannot not recall something, it can either know something or it cannot. So in his capacity as a corporate representative Rob do has a responsibility to prepare and know what free speech systems knows. When he's asked what the source for video number one is. He can't not recall, he has to either provide the source or say the company doesn't know what the source was. When he's asked if a particular employee worked on Sandy Hook material. He can't say I don't recall. And he has to say that they did. They didn't or that free speech systems doesn't know if they did.

And you can see the same car paths behind both of them. And Alex is saying that this is meant to be faking the news. And it's meant to, you know, it's supposed to be like, Oh, they're pretending they're in different places. But you can tell they're in the same place because the media is all lies. Sure. That and that had nothing to do with Sandy Hook. No, but it had to do with media lying. Yeah, it was actually people waiting for the I believe it was the jury verdict in the Jodi Arias murder trial.
