'''Lionel''' (real name Michael William Lebron<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_(radio_personality)</ref>) is the subject of several episodes, including [[247: Lionel|Episode #247]], a classic entry in the Wacky Wednesday category.

Lionel is a [[QAnon]] enthusiast and general curmudgeon, who regularly brings his own brand of classic "social commentary" to Alex's 4th hour. Segments typically begin with his bumper music, a very Latin-inspired dance beat with his name as the only lyric<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0-2Mh6fjX0&ab_channel=TheLionelShow</ref>.   This theme is in fact and excerpt from a completely unrelated song, "Nina Morena" by Gipsy Kings<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTQI3hvjLOE</ref>.

"Lionel, Lionel, Lionel, Lionel" will then launch into a "hot take" that ranges from G.W. Bush to handbags on the subway.  He's 50% Dennis Miller, 40% Andy Rooney, and 10% [[Nick Fuentes]].   The segment will then end with his tagline: "Comment as you see fit".   It's the Infowars version of "What Grinds My Gears".
