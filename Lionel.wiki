Lionel is the subject of Episode #247, a classic entry in the Wacky Wednesday category. 

Lionel is a QAnon enthusiast and general curmudgeon, who regularly brings his own brand of classic "social commentary" to Alex's 4th hour. Segments typically begin with his bumper music, a very Latin-inspired dance beat with his name as the only lyric.   "Lionel, Lionel, Lionel, Lionel" will then launch into a "hot take" that ranges from G.W. Bush to handbags on the subway.  He's 50% Dennis Miller, 40% Andy Rooney, and 10% Nick Fuentes.   The segment will then end with his tagline: "Comment as you see fit".   It's the Infowars version of "What Grinds My Gears".
