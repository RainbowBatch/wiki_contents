==Detailed Show Notes==

Dan and Jordan discuss the beginning of the week on Alex Jones' show, which is pretty all over the place.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/research/2020/5/12/episode-432-may-10-11-2020 Episode 432: May 10-11, 2020]</ref>

Topics covered include:

*Alex discusses a Swedish company that allows people who already have implanted microchips to [https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/sj-rail-train-tickets-hand-implant-microchip-biometric-sweden-a7793641.html use them to store train tickets]. He views this as the same thing as [https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/benjamin-netanyahu-suggests-to-microchip-kids-slammed-by-experts-627381 Netanyahu saying that Israel should put geo-locating chips into all school-children] as a part of reopening from Covid-19. They are not anywhere near similar.
*Alex has some erroneous ideas about [https://www.history.com/news/how-did-the-vikings-honor-their-dead Viking funerals], which [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VikingFuneral actually come from movies]. He also has some inaccurate beliefs about [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/women_01.shtml women in Viking communities].
*Alex tries to push warmed over Seth Rich conspiracies and pretends that they are new information, as opposed to long debunked garbage.
*Alex freaks out about [https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6666/text?r=2&s=1 House Resolution 6666], mostly because of the bill number. It doesn't appear that he's actually read it though.
*Alex erroneously claims that Tanzanian president John Magufuli is a "top biologist," and discusses his unproven claim to have tested a goat and a papaya for Covid-19. There's no evidence that he did this. Also, if Alex actually cares about press freedom, [https://mg.co.za/article/2018-07-02-tanzanias-illiberal-tilt/ he should be super against Magufuli].
*Alex discusses the [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/video-appears-show-georgia-man-shot-while-jogging-lawyers-call-n1201301 killing of Ahmad Arbury], poorly.
*Alex fell for [https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-guinea-vaccine/false-claim-video-shows-aftermath-of-fatal-covid-19-vaccination-in-guinea-idUSKBN22D67U a hoax video that was going around], purporting to show the aftermath of a Covid-19 vaccine trial in New Guinea. He never looked into the video, and reported a completely false story about it to his audience.
*Alex doesn't understand the [https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160501-how-its-possible-for-an-ordinary-person-to-lift-a-car phenomenon of hysterical strength]
*Alex, though he is a noted military historian, is unaware that some Army uniforms used to be called "[https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/11/23/just-greens-heres-why-army-changed-name-new-wwii-style-uniform.html Pink and Greens]."
*Alex lies about a city council resolution in San Antonio, pretending that they were going to arrest people who said "Chinese virus." [https://www.ktsa.com/san-antonio-city-council-to-vote-on-resolution-combating-hate-speech/ This is not true].
*Alex [https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/publicerat-material/publikationsarkiv/i/influenza-in-sweden/?pub=63511 completely exaggerates statistics] about [https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?artikel=5436335&programid=2054 Swedish flu death numbers].
*Alex lies that the CDC is no longer recording flu cases or flu deaths. This is not true, [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2019-2020/data/whoAllregt_cl18.html flu counts] and [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S2 flu death counts] are easy to find if you want to look, which Alex strangely hasn't done apparently.
*Alex's "8 Pack Power Stack" is [https://www.infowarsstore.com/8-pack-power-stack the most confusing product he sells]
