So if anybody would like to join in and throw some support to the Transgender Law Center that we have been raising funds for with the buttons. I realized I haven't mentioned that in quite a while. Yeah. So quite a while maybe forgotten and maybe donations have completely dried up or what have you. But if people would like to chip in for that, that would be that would be wonderful. Yeah. That's a great idea. And also, yes, we had a second person who got a Wonka button. Oh, we got a second Walker button. So this is Kristin. Out there. Got the got the second bright spot. All right.

Now we come to the episode where we discuss the march up to the live shows. So I realized that I had made a number of jokes that weren't jokes about how one of our live shows I want to be about the Howard Dean scream, it was very much not a joke. Yes. And that seemed very doable. Because we had a bit of time before the live show. And it was like, hey, that happened in January, that was in the early times of the primary running up on it. What I didn't realize was from the point we were at, to when that happens was 20 something days in 2003 time, okay, which is a lot to get through in terms of our pace, and I was like, that's gonna be fucking impossible.

But even so even even if like listening to all of it, and going through it was a ton. Presenting it on the show. We didn't have enough episodes to get through right. By the time we have the live shows. So that was a challenge, right? And I realized maybe the dream was dead. It wasn't Oh, I was gonna say did the episode end the dream was just asleep, and they had to wake up the dream. The dream got woke and went broke. Oh boy. I don't know And how many more how many more arrives? Do we? So here's the here's the situation. I started going through the 2003. Of course, I'm going through it. And we got a little bit lucky. Because part of the time between where we were in December, and where the scream happens a January Christmas break, and New Year's and New Year's break. There were a number of episodes that Alex just wasn't there, donate them some rewriting them off, and what have you. Right.

And I don't think that his calls are good in 2003. But I do think that there's something in how they change the presentation of the show. Like it breaks up his clear non coverage of story. Yeah, his rants are monotonous and boring. So the calls kind of give a sidetrack from that. And a lot of the guests that he has back in 2003 are very interesting, either, right. And so having a balance of, you know, guest who may be is aligned with white supremacists, right, don't talk about it, calls, many rants and then just rattling off headlines, right kind of works.

And he says we need federal control and federal funding to help you rancher. And I'm not saying I like Bush. My point is, he's guys are all globalist trash folks. He's another Yale boy.

It should mitad Crawford Ranch is a set complete with old tractors, hay bales. Everything is a set. And a couple of times a year Bush goes out with a chainsaw. A giant chainsaw will cut one inch trees, and it's just mindless. I'm just sick of it. Oh, he's such a good country boy. He's like John Wayne. I can't handle any more of it, folks.

No one was allowed to eat it. The the fable of Jessica Lynch that being a fabrication, Bush and the Made in USA boxes behind him last year. Up in St. Louis, Made in USA. It was really made in China. My point is, it's an illusion. It was an illusion with Bill Clinton. It's an illusion with George Bush and so many people. I mean, they think wow, he's out hunting for quail. He must be pro Second Amendment. That's what there's a neocon was saying this weekend. Then I flipped channels here. Another one praising him. Oh, he's so wonderful. You know how hard it is to shoot quail. He so manly. Shoot and quails about the easiest thing there is on the face of the planet. You find quail, and you got a shotgun.

We did too. Well, the images below grabbed from CNN is covering show us how that feat was pulled off with some skillful platform, like the panels for larger images, and they've got a clip to provide and to see what's afoot. They got a video clip. In the first frame Bradley is speaking and you'll notice that he's standing on a platform. While Dean watches far in the background. When Bradley introduces Dean, they switch places Dean steps up and Bradley steps down. The series of images show from behind how their position switch puts them at a relatively equal height. Having dupe they are willing accomplices in the media, what they think all of us, you idiots in America, they turn for the money shot and suddenly are vertically challenged Democrat front runner is as tall as the imposing looking as the former NBA superstar endorsing him.

Yeah. Beyond that he was a member of the Southern student Organizing Committee, which would later be folded into the Students for a Democratic Society. And I think you can guess what Alex's forefathers in the John Birch Society had to say about that. Oh, no, they

There's some fudging of details here in order to sell the story, but at the same time, it is almost certainly nonsense that he was arrested. There are a couple of misrepresentations in the clip that we just heard from Alex. The first is that Alex said that the Secret Service set up a free speech zone half a mile from where Bush was going to speak, and that's not strictly accurate. They set up a restricted area that was 100 yards in each side of this hangar, and then half a mile in the area between the hangar and the highway. Sure, however, it is worth noting that an official from the airport told The New York Times that they set up a free speech zone half a mile from the hangar so that could be where that information came from. Yeah, the hangar is where the rally was taking place, not where Bush was landing, just to be clear, he still had to get there to the hangar. The restricted area was not fully restricted the whole time. This is the piece that Alex isn't clarifying when he says the bursary was standing among hundreds of people. He definitely was at one point because the restricted area was free for pedestrians to mail about until pretty shortly before Bush arrived. The people who were attending the rally needed to wait in line to get in people who were waiting in line for tickets were there and there were people with signs within the restricted area until it was shut down. Once the restricted areas became restricted. The ticketed rally attendees went into the hangar and everyone else was asked to exit the area, which according to court documents was what happened except with BERSIH. Right. Bersih has said that the officer said the content of his sign was the problem. But outside of the statement, I can't find corroboration of that. It's entirely possible that it was said or it's possible that the content of his sign definitively indicated that he was not a ticketed rally goer. So that meant that the protocol would be you have to move. You know, like Yeah,

And it's hard to imagine them being predicted by someone who wasn't a gold salesman pretending to be a forecaster. Yeah, this is what I don't know how you could look at this and pick this as a responsible.

So when we've heard Bob in 2008 2009, it's very regularly, he sets it up, and then they knock it down sales page for Midas resources, or he's like you can get my newsletter, my forecast or newsletter and called Midas resources, they'll give you a free piece of silver along with your first issue. Right? Right. That isn't the case in 2003. I don't know if he is intimately related with MIDAS resources and TED ANDERSON at this point, but he is not throwing it to a Midas plug, or linking his newsletter with Midas. Okay. So there is still like very aligned interests of Alex being syndicated by a gold salesman, and Bob making comical predictions about gold. They're still that, but it's not as overt. It's not. Maybe this is still in the like, period where they're feeling it out. The partnership. Yeah,

So now we can see how he grows as a figure getting to the point where he's a weekly guest, right? See where that happens along the line. There's still other figures who are like major characters who like where are they like Steve magenic hasn't shown up. I want to find out where he shows up at this period.
