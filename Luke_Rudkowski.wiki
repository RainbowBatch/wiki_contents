'''Luke Rudkowski''' is a libertarian political activist, self-professed "journalist", and media personality, known for his work as the founder of the independent media organization WeAreChange.

Rudkowski has promoted misinformation and conspiracy theories during his numerous appearances on InfoWars. This includes 9/11 denialism and climate change denialism. Nowadays, it seems like he hangs out with [[Tim Pool]] a lot.

Rudkowski hovers around the fringes of Knowledge Fight coverage, appearing as a supporting character in wildly different eras and contexts, but so far failing to be notable enough to get a dedicated episode.
