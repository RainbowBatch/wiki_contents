'''John F. Kennedy Jr.''', son of American President [[John F. Kennedy]], was a lawyer and journalist who died in a 1999 plane crash.

For reasons beyond the scope of this page, various adherents of [[QAnon]] ludicrously believe that JFK Jr. is still alive and secretly waiting to ascend to the presidency or some other position of importance. See [[Juan O Savin]] for more details.
