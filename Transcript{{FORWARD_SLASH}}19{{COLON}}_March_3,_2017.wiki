So a lot of the stuff we're gonna end up hearing is from the second our first hour super boring, but let's start with he's got a warm up Yeah, speaking of warming up, let's warm ourselves up with a little out of context drop X, Alex,

Right now, guys. infowars.com posted to our site tweeted out right now. Obama, DOJ funded billions to liberal activist groups. We're gonna play this clip in a moment. Billions of dollars that is so illegal to have the Justice Department give money to groups secretly period political groups, to have the government funding its own party, the party in power funding its own party, and then to give it to activist groups that are running around saying kill cops and overthrow government. This is the government forming sedition against local and state governments to cause a civil war.

And what's the other one? Citibank? Yes, they had to pay out money. Yeah, he even references those. And those are the situation in the article from Breitbart. But so what he's talking about, and I actually do think it's a little bit weird, but it's definitely not illegal. One of the things is when the government sues an organization for malfeasance, right or some sort of shady business practices, right, when they get payouts, it doesn't go to the government, usually the payouts are or fines that are enforced end up having to be donated to charitable causes or things like that. Now Oh, I did not know that it's not universal across the board. It's not how all of the the payout goes when you lose against the government. Right? But in instances it's not that this money is going to radical liberal activist groups.

It's horrifying, but and it's very, very racist in this article what I've been able to dig up essentially the types of groups that are getting money are like the HUD housing Council. Yeah, which should get money, especially when housing is part of the issue that these banks are fucking with. It's a huge part of it. People foreclosing on their homes and shit

They are the ones who are suing these organizations. Yeah, I don't like that. I don't either. And that's why I said it's a little bit murky, right? There should be accurate, like these people should have victim status and have standing in court, for sure. But they don't in this case. And so the money ends up going to groups like the Housing Council, or the other one was the Legal Services Corporation, which helps provide legal services to underprivileged people,

A cure for wellness was directed by Gore Verbinski and stars Dane Dehaan and Jason Isaacs, who in the past have both made jokes online about the phenomenon of fake news. The film opens on Friday and has received mostly negative reviews. One critic Joe and then I'm not gonna be able to say his last name of the Daily News described its plot as quote preposterous Gothic nonsense.

Let's say you're now having body augmentation or changes that's going past people getting all these face surgeries and things look like the cat lady. It's now saying, Oh, I'm an alien. I'm not even human. I'm, I'm, I'm a celebrity. It's turning yourself into a carnival, show Barker, a carnival show, freak show. Show that that's how you quote make a living is not being part of the human system. So humans look at you and think there's something wrong with you. And what the system is doing is taking mental illness in many cases, and also making it fashionable and cool. This is another psychic psychological virus, they admit that they've injected into society to confuse everyone, then they have the corporate media hold it up, as if it's something beautiful and powerful to further accelerate the downfall of civilization. But humans can organize together recognize the disease in the filth, the poison grapes, the poison berries, and teach others not to eat of them and go away from the poisoned fruit. We're right back in the Garden of Eden. We have the knowledge of good we weren't dumb. It's the knowledge of evil is the virus of mental illness.

So we talked about an hour and a half and he couldn't convince me and then he did want to talk to you more. I was arrogant at the end but that's the whole way of these guys. And I had to get a guy in the suit was perfectly still Chris got his black trench coat look totally perfect. I don't know how he did it. You know, it's how these guys do this stuff. You know, just he had it all down arrogance by that but You know what, he's get his ass kicked now. But some of this army guy, and he wasn't arrogant about it. He said, You know, our military loves the fight, and loves to kill. But he said, they don't do that, because they're bad. They didn't do that, because they started out that way. They have to, you have to adapt to it and get to where you like it, or it destroys you. And the men that weren't destroyed were the ones that got to where they liked it. And the ones that are destroyed are the ones that never adapted to it. And he said, and that's what they do with the public, is they basically do bad things to us, and then get us to adapt and accept it. So it's like with really smart people, that's the highest knowledge. Is it those of us that see all this stuff we are not submitting? We're trying to adapt to actually overcome it for people and build a better system. But a lot of people think they're cool, they just roll over or go along, like, I don't care.
