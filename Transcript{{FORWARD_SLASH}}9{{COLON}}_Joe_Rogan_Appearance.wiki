But notice the stock market went up $1,200,000,000,000, just the last month or so, because a lot of institutional investors and others understand with Trump trying to create real prosperity, not a bunch of social engineering, and I'm not here to pitch Trump to people. The issue is, is that there were major intelligence agencies and patriots in the government, who were sick of what was happening, and were sick of Hillary and Obama backing jihadist groups and other things. And so they're rolling those groups up right now. They really are standing up against them. And this is a historic moment. And so there's been a counter coup through the electoral process in our country.

And I was bringing in like 2030 grand a month, which was just a huge amount for me building whole operation out of that at home. And they come to the sales guys, and they go look for a year you've not been behind y2k. And you're not letting us have all these big sponsors. And you're gonna basically be fired.

I kind of let them convince me but I think back to the point in the conference room, I just kind of went okay, okay, okay, sure. I get it and then I went, and then once I decided it was true, I really pushed it. So it's almost like I lied to myself because I'm being honest about this process so so this is what happened. for like a year and a half. I'm saying it's BS it's a government hoax because they're like the Navy says the chips are all bad for cities will completely fall and it's all the death I said, they just want to upgrade with all this new spy hubs, they want to do global standardization for the US is the Telecommunications Act of 96. They want to force all the new chips because I had NSA sources then that I was heading on okay. And I didn't realize how special was that I had the sources they're telling me it's all BS. People like don't argue with the Navy and don't and Fox News and ads to get your food was just everywhere. So I went okay, hell, okay, stuffs gonna be real. So it was like a Black Friday for the Black Friday deal. So the last few months. And the moral was ended up firing me anyways, they did, but the moral was I kind of convinced myself it was real. So by the end of it, of course, they edit like, you know, 12 hours beyond that day, and like five minutes, I'm totally insane, right, but it's like nuclear reactor having a problem here. And it really was happening. And like, you know, oh, and there was a missile firing from Russia, which like, was an ICBM, and they got like, shut down. That was ABC News. So I'm like, alright, this isn't really happening. Okay. We got prepared. It's always good to prepare, but oh no reactor is having a problem. Okay, some stuff. So there was some outages of some problems, but government and MSM had hyped it. Then they use it to demonize alternative media even then, when it wasn't catastrophic. So my gut told me it was BS. It was BS. And so thank God, I missed the whole 2012 thing. But still, they said Alex Jones says the world's ending the bureau 2012 where he restaurants when I say it's all a load of crap, but I didn't criticize you when I saw you doing it. I said I

He said, In 1967, we certified at the Stanford Research Institute that he was able to control hurricanes, create hurricanes, and steer hurricanes, all that got black budgeted shut down. And then they got into these arrays where they could use antennas. And out of that, and Westinghouse came came the the whole heart program.

The elite are all about transcendence and living forever, and the secrets of the universe. And they want to know all this. Some are good, some are bad. Some are a mix. But the good ones don't ever want to organize the bad ones and want to organize because they lust for power. Powerful, consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people, they want to empower them. So they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game, then they come together evils always defeated, because good is so much stronger. And we're on this planet. And Einstein's physics show that Max Planck says shut it off. There's at least 12 dimensions. And now that's all the top scientists and billionaires are coming up saying it's a false hologram it is artificial, the computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected. And gravity's bleeding in to this universe. That's what they call dark matter. We're like a thought or a dream. That's a wisp in some computer program, some Gods mind, whatever, they're proving it all, it's all coming out. Now there's like this sub transmission zone below the third dimension, that's just turned over the most horrible things is what it resonates to. And it's trying to get up into the third dimension. That's just a basic level consciousness to launch into the next levels. And our species is already way up in the fifth sixth dimension consciously our best people, but there's this big war trying to like basically destroy humanity, because humanity has freewill. And there's a decision to which level we want to go to, we have free will. So evils allowed to come and contend and not just good.

Now Descartes, on the other hand, Descartes was a mathematician, not a logician. Well, a philosopher. Yeah, well, yeah. But even then, it was because of his affinity to math. All of all of his, all of his syllogisms were purely if A then B kind of situations. Sure, it was all opponents. Exactly. Now, Isaac Newton, on the other hand, was a pure Alpha Alchemist.
