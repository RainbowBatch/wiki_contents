'''Donn de Grand Pré''' is one of Alex's old guests with a really fun name. He's from the pre 2009 era. He wrote a couple books. If you want context, you can listen to [[166: February 2-3, 2009|166]].

He's perhaps most notable in Knowledge Fight lore because of a running joke from [[231: March 24, 2009|231]] @ 00:41:14, where a caller asks about him:<blockquote>Caller: Anyway, another thing, what's the latest on Colonel Donn de Grand Pré? Have we found out how he's doing?

Alex: Yes -- he's -- he died.

Caller: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. <long pause> Welp, anyway, thanks Alex. You're doing a great job.

Alex: Thank you sir, I appreciate your call.</blockquote>The delivery is completely deadpan, and the end result is hilarious.
