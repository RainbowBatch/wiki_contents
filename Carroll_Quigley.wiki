'''Carroll Quigley''' was a prominent American historian, and author of books like ''[[Tragedy and Hope]]'', who died in 1977. There's a lot of interesting stuff to be discussed about Quigley's actual work and ideas, but all of that has next to no influence on the crazy stuff that [[Alex Jones]] says about his writings.

Alex misrepresents Quigley's work to bolster the false idea that nefarious "[[globalists]]" are manipulating and controlling various aspects of finances and society. Basically, Alex is misquoting passages from ''Tragedy and Hope'' to launder ideas from the [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|PEZ]].
