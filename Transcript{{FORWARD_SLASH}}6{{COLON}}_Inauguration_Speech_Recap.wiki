Yeah, it's bizarrely it's just like I told you, so that was most of what it was. And he you do have to give him credit. He did. Like in the in the y2k episode, he, the blind squirrel and the crazy occasional night. He totally nailed it. Well, but to be fair, it's called out Osama bin Laden, too, but it's very easy to predict that 911 would happen and bin Laden would take responsibility, given that he'd already attacked the World Trade Center.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 09:04
    | text      = So here's my here's my thesis that may be developed over the course of this episode. Okay. It's a three prong thesis. All right. The first is that Alex was wasted through most of the weekend and that's why they kept him off air and had David Knight hosting most of their coverage for the 14 hours. All right,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 09:21
    | text      = we got that one. That's pretty well established. David
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 09:23
    | text      = Knight back in studio Leann McAdoo, also in studio Paul Joseph Watson lives in London. So he wasn't he just Skypes in and stuff like that. All right, Alex and Owen Shroyer and Rob do. We're on the ground? Rob do of course is the cameraman who sometimes gets on camera and yeah, is not great yet. Oh, also, they had shots because there's like cameras on top of cameras. It's a Communist Chinese restaurant. Yeah. And you could smell they
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 09:53
    | text      = have cameras that are videotaping people videotaping people. Yes. To prove that there is yeah
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 09:59
    | text      = Rob. Do his elaborate camera setup. He has one of those things, the stabilizers Yeah. But what's attached to it is two iPhones. They don't even have cameras, they have iPhones that they're using with a boom mic.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 10:13
    | text      = You know, the the cameras on the iPhones aren't that bad? No, I agree. I mean, there there's there's some good stuff. I'm not advertising for iPhones.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 10:21
    | text      = No, but you'd think a professional operation would have cameras as opposed to what I have. Well,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 10:26
    | text      = we've already established their money stream is very
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 10:29
    | text      = suspect. tenuous. Yeah. So my first thesis is that that Alex was drunk and they kept him off air for a large portion of it, which kind of makes it boring. Because we want Alex we don't want
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 10:39
    | text      = these other word drunk on broadcasts the whole time or 10 hours. That would be the best thing I've ever seen. I wouldn't have turned it off. No, that would be the most compelling situation to watch. So my specially because you know, he would fall in and out of sleep at least once or twice. Oh, yeah. He's pissing on a tree.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 10:55
    | text      = And he's drunk before the ball. Imagine after amazing. Actually, I think I have a clip from after. Okay. But the second prong of my thesis, do you have the speech? Which speech
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 11:11
    | text      = at the at the deplorable? No, that was oh, God, that was that must have been
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 11:15
    | text      = incredible. I think that's behind closed doors. Shit, like Hillary at Goldman Sachs. Yeah. But the second prong of my thesis is that he wasn't really welcomed there at the inauguration. Oh, that Trump didn't even really invite him. He went to this deplorable, which was a secondary thing. It's like, if you go to like, Wrestlemania, there's wrestle con, then yeah, you go to like, some big event. There's a secondary event. Yeah, he was invited to deplorable. But there's a video and it's not really good for audio. So I didn't put it on in our collection. There's a video of him getting thrown out of the inauguration. No, there's a video of cops taking him out of a big crowd past a barrier.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 11:55
    | text      = That is and he's going to spin it as far as on safety. Of course.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 11:58
    | text      = Oh, sure. Too many, too many people were coming at me the globalists. Yep. So
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 12:03
    | text      = there's a were afraid of me, you know, telling the truth. All of the clips
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 12:06
    | text      = that he posted, all the interviews are him just somewhere on the street, surrounded by like 10 or 20 people. Okay, so all of the clips are places that you don't need access to get to. I have no evidence that he's actually anywhere important. That is amazing. So my secondary thesis merged with my first one is that this is all sort of an elaborate charade about his access that he has. Yeah. And he knows it. And he's cracking under the pressure.
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Jordan
    | timestamp = 12:33
    | text      = And he's not in the actual inauguration. really fucks him up, because he feels like he is taking credit for his carry in the water. Exactly. Yeah. And then all of a sudden to be betrayed like that, which we all saw coming. Every single and he wants to

    | text      = Well, and this is the first time he's ever been stepped on on the way to the top because he's never had well, he's no one's ever allowed him. Exactly. Yeah. Nobody's he's never had anybody to step on him because nobody likes him or wants him anywhere. No. And then all of a sudden, he he did some he did some groundwork and it's like, now I gotta kick you to the curb. Yeah, I that must be a horrifying now. I kind of feel bad for him. I don't. Okay, good point,
}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 13:28
    | text      = I hope just on the last episode, he's very evil. Yeah, it's not so good. Fuck him. So I think that what's happening is that Trump has led him along in a big way. Yeah. And now it's gotten to a point where it's like, look, I'm actually president now. Yeah, I can't have you at the gala are going to cause a scene like

There's one clip that I think is sort of coherent enough of it, and it's after the inauguration speech, and sort of a breakdown. It's sort of a, like a, let's, that's, let's fuckin take this apart piece by piece. Okay, the inauguration speech, and I don't think he does a really great job of it. But here is the beginning of the clip where he introduces his thesis, okay, about what Trump's inauguration speech was all about. Oh, boy.

And America began to come back from the dead in the last few months, and now has come back to life. The Phoenix is coming up right now. And how powerful that Phoenix is how incredible that destiny is. He's up to us. We are what breathes life into the spirit into us. And the enemy knows everything's energy. You see, forget all the religious books and all the preachers are there to control the paradigm. They that the enemy wants to destroy our spirit make us feel weak, so we don't take our birthright and destiny. We're taking the destiny in our hands. We're breathing life into it. And those devil worshippers up there the enemy devil worshiper, Obama devil worshippers. Well, now these are devil worshippers, well, not a worshiper, they want people they want to be number one, they don't like see you they see the white paper. Okay, what somebody that wants prosperity and Renaissance, they want wealth, a cornucopia. They're not jealous of somebody who's got a big house or good looking wife, or vice versa, as long as you. For me, I think your success is great. These people are devil worshipers. And what happened today was the the chief executive invited God back in and said the doors open. And instead of the people, the doors open now to you. If you want this birthright, if you want goodness, we've all got to be good. We've got to come together. And we've got to whether you're black, hire white people, if you're white, or blue, whatever the only issues that we stand for and what we believe in and transcend all the control.
