Or Alex and Owen Troyer going to a Bayto rally like and getting acting like assholes. Yeah, all those things are really is Alex hijacking people's social media presence by going into the spaces that they're in and forcing them to make videos of him? That is free promotion?

I have never before seeing that happen, right. And we'll discuss that as we go along. But before we get to that, before we get to that, it would be great.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:08:03.000
    | text      = here's the interesting thing. Before we get going, there's an important point I need to make about what we're going to listen to and the fact that Alex is sworn in. This is a deposition that Alex is being made to sit and answer questions about regarding his civil suit which accuses him of defaming the families of Sandy Hook victims. The fact that this is a civil case is very important, although we just heard him be sworn in here at the beginning of the episode and he is under oath. Perjury is a very different thing in civil cases than it is in criminal cases. In civil cases, there's no formal penalty for lying in a deposition, which Alex absolutely does multiple times in this three hour session that he sets for punishing them for perjury in a civil case would require winning the case. And then after the fact having your lawyer file new criminal charges for the perjury charge, the best the prosecution could really hope for within this case, is to demonstrate that Alex is being evasive or outright deceitful, and then show evidence to illustrate that during the actual trial and cross examination, even then, the only consequence would be the court viewing Alex as an unreliable witness, which would be the result of him just answering any question with or without the proof of civil perjury being in play. Alex knows this. His lawyers know this. So they really know that there's no real stakes here. The only benefit of something like this comes from the public seeing it, which is why I'm very glad that this deposition got posted online by the law firm. There's a great deal of value for our purposes in seeing Alex stammer and try to pretend he knows anything about what he's talking about. But ultimately, there's very little legal value in this. I suspect. Again, I'm not a lawyer, but from everything I've been able to tell the civil consequences for perjury are not the very real

And one of the things that kept coming up was the idea of like, where to hide your guns? No. Lawyers don't have any ideas about that. The idea that this is like a huge blind spot of the legal system, yeah. Especially the civil legal system. And so Alex kind of knows that he doesn't have to give a fuck he can sort of sleepwalk through this. Yeah.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:10:53.000
    | text      = wag. Yep. In the wake of this deposition being posted, I saw a large number of headlines that were being circulated that had to do with Alex saying that he had a psychosis that made him believe that things were conspiracies. And it's my duty to say that this is intentionally Miss reporting the story. Alex does use the word psychosis in the conversation about his journey as a conspiracy theorist. But if you listen to the context, it's very clear that he's speaking metaphorically and loosely about his mind state, visa vie his distrust of media sources, the entire quote, unquote, psychosis narrative boils down to this clip that we're about to hear, which is a little over like a minute long. And it comes from literally the last few minutes of the three hour deposition. So here is what everybody is making headlines out of. And I would argue that that is a great disservice, first of all, to the other stuff that's in this, and the fact that they're kind of playing fast and loose, and it just helps him.

So I think as a pundit and someone giving an opinion, that, you know, my opinions have been wrong, but they were never wrong consciously to hurt people. And so I think it's part of that process of me growing up in Rockwall, Texas, watching the police kill drugs and then conduct anti drug programs at school. I think that shook my opinion, the police in general, and I was very anti law enforcement till I grew up and learn more things. Now. I'm pretty much pro police. So it's, it's been a process

Yeah, he's describing a learned pattern of behavior that he got into where I distrust the media, they're saying X, I think x must be fake. And as I got older, and I started to learn more, I realized that default position is not a good way to operate. Now he is lying, no absolute about how he operates. Of course, that perception is not like that. It's not descriptive of like a mental psychosis or anything like that. It's it's

So I don't balk at this whole thing for that reason I just have seen out to operate for so long and know that reporting that snippet of his conversation as quote Alex says he has a psychosis is literally playing into Alex's hands and serves to validate his narratives about media persecution against him. All this is to say that I'm pretty disappointed with that coverage, especially considering there's a whole lot of stuff in here that would have made great headlines.

I assume you saw some of those. Yes. How long is this? Are we talking? Are we talking days, weeks? Months?

On the 14th of December he was he was out there on his show. Like, oh, this stinks. Yep, that sort of thing. So that is the idea that he's trying to say like, well, all of these, all these YouTube videos started coming up. And then a month later, I started being like, well, maybe something's up.

So I believe that there's a base of accuracy in what he's about to say about what he did after Sandy Hook. He's just forgotten the other stuff. Gotcha, which is what this lawsuit is about. Right? Right. It might be strategic forgetting. But here's what he has to say.

It was like almost seven years ago. But we've gone back and looked at some of it trying to find like, least three weeks, four weeks or so. And then it was such a firestorm internet's like, No, this isn't Prozac. This isn't video games. Like I was saying I thought like other spirits, shootings that happened. This was some type of staged event or multiple shooters or people in the woods and things like that. There was a whole range of theories.

And he did skip away a little bit from like the aggressive poking at Sandy Hook so I could see how he could look back comment period of his life and be like, I was mostly just talking about gun shit. Right? It's it's interesting. Like, it's an interesting line because I can't I can't dispute that. But it's ludicrous to say like, I didn't also do the other stuff.

Mr. Barnes of Enoch. No, no, no, they're two different firms. But bars been named Barnes is the one who's supposed to be defending Alex in the deposition. Yes. So he's the one who can make sort of objection. Yeah. And he does a lot, of course. But Mr. Enoch is there and he's not supposed to talk, because it's not a to lawyer deposition.

And there's a fundamental problem with the narrative that Alex is pushing. And it's spelled out in this clip, and we'll discuss it on the other end.

That's not what they're suggesting at all. And they were very clear about that. And so for Enoch to come in and be like, hey, it's manipulative that you're, you know, you're you're playing from different episodes when you said they were are the same Yeah, is just a desperation tactic to try and give Alex some sort of cover to make similar arguments as the deposition goes on. Yeah, because his only defense is that these clips are edited, because otherwise he has to take ownership for the things that he was saying. Because these aren't things that he's saying is like someone else says that this is the case. And we're reporting on it. He is reporting it. Yep. And so that's a problem. So now to the firehouse issue. The reason in that last clip is a problem that Alex is saying that this is the school that he's representing to his audience that it's the school is that in this next clip, the prosecution brings up prior evidence indicates that at the point that Alex told his audience that it was the school yeah, he had to have known it wasn't Oh, no.

And so now there's another narrative that they bring up. And that is the idea that Alex was trying to pitch the story that the school was closed. And so the idea that this shouldn't happen, it couldn't possibly happen. The school had been closed for a long time. Before that. It was it was a dilapidated school, there was mold everywhere.

And it's one thing to do it with these narratives that he can just say, like, hey, Wolfgang Halbig told me this, and that's why I reported it. It's much more robust when you bring in a piece of information that he should know about, and he doesn't. And in this first clip, the prosecutor talks about first responders to the school. And Alex is put on his heels a little bit.

There was a bathroom in the corner, there was a massive pileup of bodies in this room. At this time, I did not know it was a bathroom and I wondered how the suspect had the time to kill that many people and stack them in the corner of the room. Sergeant carrio stated he was an EMT, or maybe a paramedic. And then you had to check to see if anyone in the pile might have survived may have survived. I agreed as the bodies were stacked two and three high and that some of the children at the bottom who were able to cram at first may have escaped holes. He began to check for life signs, wounds and attempt to find a pulse. The victims on the top of the pile redacted and many of the bodies had injuries that were obvious and fatal. It appeared as though as if the teachers in the room immediately upon hearing gunshots began to pack children into the bathroom. The children that were sitting on the floor of the bathroom are packed in like sardines. One little girl was sitting perhaps in between the toilet seat in the back corner of the room. I thought she may have had the best chance for survival. As Sergeant carrio entered a surge of cardio got to the last bodies. It was clear that no one had survived. You've never heard of certain cardio heavy I haven't and you didn't know what he did in the building week you didn't know what he didn't

Yeah, he's like he's falling back on the only defense he has, right, that clip of me was to write, when in reality that that approach is really good. Because what it does is it demonstrates a piece of information that was available as of some time in 2013. When Alex should have had access to that information, if he cared, either you don't know or you're lying? No, it introduces the the two possibilities that encompass all possible realities for us. And that is he either knew about this stuff, or he didn't, if he did know about it, that he intentionally lied about it. If he didn't know about it, then it's clear that he didn't look into anything. Exactly. So that sort of thing is putting him in his position where he has to make that sort of choice about how he wants to represent what he does. And he can't make that choice.

And then, in this next clip, he discusses Alex's reporting about the idea that the birth certificates and death certificates of all these kids were put under strict wraps.

And there are pictures of them at other mass tragedies. And he's talking specifically about a picture of one of the kids. That was a part of a mural that was made in Pakistan after a bombing.

He goes over Lenny goes over some of that stuff in the This American Life episode. Yeah. If you want more context for that from his own perspective, but Alex did, apparently out Lenny as the person running it up till that point before that. He was running this organization anonymously, really. So Alex himself is the one who fucked that, apparently. So Holy shit.

And it's just the school system and government trying to cover its rear end from from from from liability. And so there definitely has been a very, there's been a cover up of the events.

And also, I don't believe that anything that he's done, visa vie Sandy Hook. I don't think that it's appropriate for the idea of a school trying to cover liability, like that conspiracy is very small. Like in terms of scope. Yeah, I don't think it merits this kind of attention doesn't merit. Any of the things that Alex did.

This is all that answer is is like an indication of like, I still didn't do anything wrong, right? And unwillingness to engage with the complaints that many many people are making about it. So So now we jump into more narratives. It's really interesting the way the structure of this went because there were like, there were some narratives upfront, and then they deteriorate into like, some more general conversation. And then we get some more narratives here at this point, and then it sort of it has waves to it a little bit. And I think part of that is because Alex is someone who you just he's slippery. You can't nail him down. Yeah, like if you went into this deposition expecting like you were going to ask leading questions that were going to be exactly the responses you wanted. You're a fool. Oh, yeah. So I think having a little bit of flexibility is really, to this guy's advantage. Because you can go hit this point, move around a little bit, respond to something he says, elicit the I didn't wrong people, I still think something's up with. You could get those things out of him that you never really would have expected you would get out of him. And so maybe there's a wind somewhere there. But we get back to narratives now. And Alex has made the claim multiple times that there was a standout of Lee stand down, both at Sandy Hook and Parkland all of the shooters. Yeah, no matter what he just says. There's just there's a standout. It means nothing. And He's pressed on it. And he can't defend his assertion at all.

So at this point, they asked about Alex's content, conjecture about Anderson Cooper's nose disappearing, and it being a green screen, when reality experts have gone on record and discussed how it's a compression problem with the video files that are uploaded. And so Alex gets into like this long thing about how he's an expert on green screens. And he knows all about him. Alex says he's an expert and knows all about him. Oh, boy, it's not worth listening to. It's an interesting conversation that the two of them are having were the prosecutors like, so you know, you know about how to align green screens, you know about that. And that was like, wow, you know, you got to, there's a wheel and you put it to the right color. Who cares? It's, it's neither here nor there. But it brings us to probably my favorite thing that this prosecutor does on this episode. And that is he sets Alex up to fall into a fucking huge trap. That is has nothing to do really with Sandy Hook. But it delights me. So this first clip, the trap is set. And it only is involved at all because it has to do with how Alex doesn't know anything about green screens. Okay, so it kind of proves that he has no business saying that Anderson Cooper's nose disappeared because of a green screen. So it's still kind of related. But it's so tertiary that I love it.

So when you say something like some people have said that they've been hurt, but haven't, you can't take that outside of the context of why you're in this deposition, that is very heavily implying that some of these people who are the victims and the family members of victims of this horrible tragedy are lying about the pain that they're in. Yeah, that's unspeakably fucked up. I think, on some level that indicates a brain state and in a position that is worse than him calling these people actors. Yeah.

This is the headline, not his psychosis bullshit, right. The idea that he's implying that some people are, are like, in some way, pretending they're hurt when they're not only to attack him.

Which is why if that was all this was, I would say that this is a failure of a deposition, or something like that. But I think because of the approaches that we're made in terms of taking the angle of like, you, you the work you do at Infowars is fundamentally flawed, you never check anything, and making him sort of talk about that. Yeah, that's a fantastic approach. Similarly, pointing out things that He clearly doesn't know about, but should and introduce the question of, if you knew about this, that's a problem. If you don't know about this, that's a problem, right? Those sorts of things are really salient good ways to approach Alex. So even though we come to the end, and it's this, like, you got the receipts, you got the evidence. He doesn't give a shit. I'm not going to admit I did anything wrong. I don't care. I didn't cause them any pain, or whatever. Like, just because that is a fizzle. It doesn't mean that there's not some pieces that are valuable within resto? Well, the

So when I saw that he had to sit for this. I was like, oh, oh, my God, you know, that was the first thought I had. And then the second thought I had was like, this is probably going to be a dud, the approach is going to be a disaster, it's gonna be useless. And to, you know, to actually go through it and see like, it's kind of a mix. And I think it is pretty valuable. It's, it's heartening in some ways, but at the same time, seeing the way that so many people are covering it with the lead of it being the psychosis kind of thing is disheartening. Yeah, that's right. And so I live in the exact same space I lived in for the last two years, which is like, other signs of things. All right. And then things are like plot. I think that I feel rusty about the show. I think we got through it pretty good. But I think that, you know, we'll get our sea legs back as we as we go along. But this has been fun.
