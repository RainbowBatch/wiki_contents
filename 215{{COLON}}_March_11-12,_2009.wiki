Today, Dan and Jordan discuss the March 11th and 12th, 2009 episodes of The Alex Jones Show. These are an epic couple days in Occupied Texas, as Alex finally gets around to releasing The Obama Deception (or does he?). As if that wasn't enough, he spends a lot of time explaining how he owns "his women," then receives a mysterious classified document that will become a huge part of his mythology moving forward.
