'''Rob Dew''' is a long-time InfoWars employee, who is currently the "News Director" of the operation. His reports and presentation are generally very boring, but not "[[David Knight]] level boring."

== '''Rob Dew The Journalist''' ==

Since at least 2009, Rob Dew has been involved with InfoWars Nightly News as an anchor and News Director. A large portion of his work there involved covering the same intellectually dishonest news stories that Alex had earlier in the day, but with a slight veneer of professionalism added.

Interestingly, at earlier points in his career, there are some indications that Rob Dew thought he was performing the role of a journalist, as opposed to being a propagandist. For instance, there are multiple examples of him trying to stick to journalistic standards while Alex Jones insists he manufacture a reality that fits their pre-existing worldview.

It's also possible he understands that completely, and it would be naive to think that he doesn't know what he's doing. Either way, no matter if you look at Rob Dew generously or cynically, he's been working as an underling for Alex to create manipulative lies about the world for over a decade.

== '''Rob Dew Is An Asshole''' ==

In 2018, former InfoWars employee Ashley Beckford filed an EEOC complaint against Alex and his company, Free Speech Systems, Inc. In the document, Rob Dew is not painted in a very good light.

He apparently is a bad boss, demanding his subordinates work unpaid overtime, saying they'd "better be dead" if they miss work. She claims that at a certain point in her employment, she was becoming upset with the clearly racist undertones of so much of InfoWars content, and she brought this up to Rob Dew, her direct supervisor, and he did nothing to address her concerns. This should come as no surprise, because she also alleged that Rob would later call her "a coon," which even if he meant raccoon (as he claimed in his defense), he should know better than to use that term.

Former InfoWars Video Editor [[Rob Jacobson]] also filed an EEOC complaint around the same time, and his also paints Rob Dew as a bit of a dick, saying that Dew would refer to him as "the Resident Jew."

== '''Rob Dew's Work At InfoWars''' ==

In all the research that went into compiling the information on this site, no evidence was uncovered that Rob Dew has been responsible for contributing to anything relevant from a news prospective.

== Rob Dew is a (Terrible) Corporate Representative ==

On November 26, 2019, Rob Dew sat as the corporate representative for InfoWars ([[Free Speech Systems LLC]]) in [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|the Texas Sandy Hook Case]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TinJ7OyPRUI</ref>. He generally had no idea what he was doing and made a mockery of the process. Subsequent corporate representatives ([[Daria Karpova]] and [[Brittney Paz]]) were not much better, resulting in sanctions.
