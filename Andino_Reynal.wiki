'''Federico Andino Reynal''' is a former federal prosecutor and Texas attorney who has represented [[Alex Jones]] in a number of [[Notable Legal Proceedings|civil legal trials]]<ref>https://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Find_A_Lawyer&template=/Customsource/MemberDirectory/MemberDirectoryDetail.cfm&ContactID=298079</ref><ref>https://frlaw.us/attorney-profile/f-andino-reynal-esq/</ref>.

Knowledge Fight fans often call him "Fed" both as a reference to his first name (although he goes by Andino) and his former profession.

Federico was brought onto Alex's legal team not long before trials in Texas were originally scheduled to start. While he did not represent Alex during his [[InfoW et. al. Bankruptcy Case|ill-fated bankruptcy disruption]], he has represented Alex before [[Judge Maya Gamble]] in the [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|Heslin]], [[Pozner Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Pozner v. Jones)|Posner]], and [[Texas Parkland Shooting Lawsuit (Fontaine v. Jones)|Fontaine]] matters in Texas. He was also recently admitted Pro Hac Vice to Connecticut to represent Alex in the [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|Lafferty case]], although by [[Judge Barbara Bellis]]' ruling, he will not have a speaking role at that trial.
