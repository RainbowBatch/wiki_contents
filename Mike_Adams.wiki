'''Mike Adams''' is "The Health Ranger" and proprietor of Natural News, one of the world's most popular "health conspiracy" websites.

Natural News is a one-stop shop for all things that fall into the heading of "medical bullshit." While the site is supposedly a place where you can get the information you need to try to argue with people about how bad vaccines are, it also seems to weirdly slip into political territory all the time, like [https://web.archive.org/web/20110430220951/http://www.naturalnews.com/032217_Obama_birth_certificate.html discussing how Obama's birth certificate is fake]. Mike has taken down all his articles about how most national tragedies are false flags, and now redirects them to a page that explains not that he was wrong and embarrassed about it, but that "his mission changed," and it's all medicine now.

Of course, that didn't stop Mike from creating a website entirely dedicated to harassing [[David Hogg]], one of the survivors of the [[Parkland shooting]], almost immediately after the shooting. It's called HoggWatch, and it's full of bullshit, with headlines like "Dear David Hogg, you're a lying, opportunistic, insufferable little toe rag."

Mike is a real top-tier asshole.
