So we recorded the the formulaic objections episode but Alex's deposition on Saturday, a day earlier than usual. Right? We usually record on Sunday. And honestly, it was sort of my intention to do that on Mondays show, and then the rest of the deposition stuff on on Friday, which would be this episode, but things didn't. We'll get to that. And, of course, but the reason we recorded a day early was because I was very kindly invited to give a lecture at the University of Kansas and Lawrence, by Professor Colin. And, boy, what a weird turn of events. I didn't want to talk about it on the show itself. She made a post about it in the Facebook group chat, but he didn't want to mention it on the show itself just for the sake of like respecting the purity of kind of the academic setting. The possibility of a bunch of people to show up and like treat it like a live show.

In reality, Pelosi was the victim of a home invasion and the person was holding him hostage with a hammer. But he was that guy who came in David de Pape was really more interested in his wife, Mr. Pelosi was able to convince the guy to let him use the bathroom where his phone was charging and he made a call to police being careful to speak in language that wouldn't set off alarms for the guy with a hammer. Yeah, Pelosi did convey to 911 that the guy's name was David specifically that the guy had said that his name was David. He also was clear that he didn't know who he was and that he planned to wait there for his wife to arrive. Just after police arrived David hit Pelosi with a hammer and was arrested. In the ambulance Pelosi told officer Ariane Starks that he quote had never seen to pay before. The glass was not broken outward, a witness who was working security at the neighboring address, nearby house saw quote, an individual and all black carrying a large black bag on his back walking near the Pelosi residence. He quote, then heard what sounded like banging on either a door or car. Also in a post arrest interview, de Pape admitted that he quote broke into the house through a glass door, which was a difficult task that required the use of a hammer to Papes interview is consistent with Pelosi version of events in that they didn't know each other. And that debate had arrived broken in and demanded to know where Nancy was to pay. It made it clear to police that he wanted to hold her hostage, and that if she lied to him, he would break her kneecaps, so she would have to be, quote, wheeled into Congress, which will show other members of Congress, there were consequences to actions. It's clear from his admissions to police from his actions and from his writing prior to the attack that David de Pape is a far right extremist who was at best attempting to hold the Speaker of the House hostage and to name her. Yeah, it's very obvious why people across the right wing media ecosystem from Alex to Matt Walsh to Glenn Greenwald, have tried to run interference on this story and craft a different narrative out of it. And that's because it's a direct result of their ideology and rhetoric. They know that and they welcome it. But in order to keep the business running, it's key to disown your children once they take action. That's all that's going on right here. Right? Very, very repetitive. We've seen this a million times. Yeah.

So he made a really big deal out of how the CDC was going to stop monitoring flu deaths. He settled on that as a fake explanation for the things back then and he hasn't thought about it since. And he just has an updated talking points. Yeah, even so in the 2021 flu season, it was estimated that the flu resulted in between eight and 13 million cases in between 5014 1000 deaths. It was relatively mild as was the 2020 season most likely because of the broad adoption of COVID mitigation strike. She's like social distancing. And wearing masks, people have seemed to decide that she is all done with. So whatever benefit that was bringing about is gone. One variable that's likely unrelated to human behavior patterns is that the flu is coming early this year. And it looks like this year, the h3 and to strain that spreading is fairly severe. That's unlucky, partially because about 26 million less people have gotten the flu vaccine than did in 2020, which conceivably could be, at least in part attributed to the meteoric rise of anti Vax rhetoric and belief in the intervening years, pushed by folks like Alex. Yeah, much of the influence that Alex and his ilk have put into the world have contributed to the pretty bleak situation we see in front of us in terms of flu. But naturally, when things get bad, it'll just be reported to the audience as evidence that he was right all along, because he just gets to claim that flu deaths are secretly COVID vaccine deaths without proving it in any way.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:31:45.000
    | text      = So as usual, Alex has completely misunderstood the Bible verse. He claims that he bases a lot of his thinking around yeah, there are two verses that he's referencing here with the fruit and the trees. One of them is Luke 643 through 45, which says quote, for a good tree does not bear bad fruit nor does a bad tree bear good fruit, for every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush, a good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. A similar passage is found in Matthew 715 through 20. Quote, beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree bears good fruit but bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their fruits, you will know them. This appears in both Luke and Matthew because both of those gospels are largely believed to have been derived from a common source. That's a really complicated matter. So to stick to the simple stuff. Alex has no idea what these verses mean. Apparently, even in this long meandering plum and Apple story that he's telling, Alex offers two different interpretations of how you can tell a tree by its fruit, and they're both wrong in terms of what the Bible says. The first he presents is that you can tell how good a tree is not by how big it is, but by the amount of fruit it produces. This is a fun way to think about plants, but it's not related to that scripture at all. The second version Alex comes up with is that you weigh the good fruit against the bad fruit in order to determine if a tree is good or bad makes perfect sense also, not what the Bible is saying. Yeah, the real problem with this Bible verse is that it espouses an absolute that humans can't really live up to good trees produce good fruit and bad trees produce bad fruit No good tree produces bad fruit, no bad tree produces good fruit. Therefore, if you produce bad fruit, you're a bad tree. And if you produce good fruit, you're a good tree. Yeah, there's a reason that people like to think of it in a different way. Because the other way of thinking about it, do you mean the more accurate way of thinking about it? It's hard is possible predestination. In this actual context, the verses really unhelpful to Alex because it would require him to put definite labels on people which are rigid and cannot be changed. Alex can't work in that environment because he needs to be able to shift the allegiances of his imaginary allies and enemies depending on what headlines he needs to respond to. And if they're determined to be unwaveringly good or bad, it hurts his ability to make shit up as he goes along. This is all very stupid, and it illustrates how Alex's understanding of His holy text is really just surface level and mostly based on catchphrases. He doesn't really grasp. And naturally this is all really just a ramp up for Alex to explain that he'll determine whether or not Elon Musk is a good tree based on whether or not he lets Alex back on Twitter. Yeah, it's really what Jesus was talking about. Hey, go yeah, we'll see. We'll see what fruits it is.

And every broadcaster special This was particularly just talking about why there's a war on children and why the real currency of the satanic global elite in their minions is hurting and killing children. And then this afternoon, when I was going through clips and doing research here, about three hours ago, at the office, I saw a clip of Laura Logan, the famous investigative journalist, who they're really demonizing and attacking now for coming out against the boys and shots, and the globalist that she was talking about why they target children as an affront to God, and that's really what it's all about. And then they're given basically evil rewards by the god of this world. For what they do,

    | text      = I'm not sure if the problem people had with Laura Logan was that she said that there's a war on children and it's done as an affront to God. That kind of commentary probably would preclude her from being on a network that's trying to do serious work, but she was on Newsmax that's not a big deal there. Her comments were so inappropriate that Newsmax had to put out a statement saying they wouldn't interview her again. She was a guest on Eric Bolling show and she said quote, they may think that they're going to become gods. That's what they tell us. You know, the ones who want us eating insects, cockroaches, and that well they die and that well they dine on the blood of our children. Those are the the people right, they're not going to win. So Logan's blood libel laden. Q anon rant was just another step on her path to full on public conspiracy lunatic and a lot of people have this notion that she's fallen so far. She was formerly the chief foreign affairs correspondent at CBS News, which is a lofty position compared to someone no longer welcome on Newsmax, but the reality is she already fallen from grace. She was put on leave of absence by CBS in 2013, after an internal investigation found that her reporting on Benghazi was fraudulent and that quote, key elements of the story were untrue. Her reporting relied heavily on a story told by a contractor named Dylan Davies, who was lying to her. Davies spawn a story about how he'd gotten into combat during the attack, and he'd seen Ambassador Stevens body but unfortunately, he already told the FBI that he never left the villa that evening, and that he hadn't been on the scene at all. Ouch. Logan did not follow up on details of day the story that would have indicated credibility problems. She also failed to disclose that he had a book deal selling his fraudulent story about what he did during the attack out Chanda, these weren't the only problems. It was shitty work. And it's not the kind of mistake you would think it would be made by someone who is otherwise good at their job. The first time mistake, it's very sloppy.

The comments that were made is that there's a 25 day supply of diesel fuel in the country, which was to say that if all production were to stop immediately, it would run out in 25 days. The thing is that production didn't stop and it isn't stopping. So there's no date where the fuel is just going to be magically gone. an economics professor explained to CBS News that we generally have a supply that would last about 35 to 40 days out, but there's a tightening of supply and an increase of demand that slightly lowering that window, but it'll adjust back eventually. The point is that diesel isn't running out. This is just a dumb lie Alex is using to scare his listeners. Also, let's be clear, if we had an impending day that was less than a month out where we'd be entirely out of diesel fuel, and we had no plan in place to adapt to that that would be a catastrophe. Most of our trucking delivery folks rely on it to bring food around the country among countless other goods that need to be transported.

    | text      = So there's no evidence that Pelosi and debate were in their underwear when the police arrived. Pelosi was asleep when debate broke into the house, so he wasn't a pajama shirt and boxer shorts. So you could say that his underwear? Initial reporting from KTVU, Fox Two had incorrectly said that the paper was in his underwear. But this was a misunderstanding of him being in his shorts, right. Paul Pelosi answered the door but the phrasing of the initial police report a didn't specify who had answered the door leading right wing media figures to just assume that it must have meant that there was a third person that of course, there was not and now it's just reporting that based on nothing, maybe you saw a meme? Who knows? Yeah, the websites and writings that were found created by de Pape were not fake. He did have a bit of a hippie phase back in like 2013, but had since descend a deeply into extreme right wing bullshit, much of which matches up pretty well with the stuff Alex yells about every day. Yeah, he had a blog where he explained that he was radicalized by GamerGate. As is the case for so many ding dongs and after that point, he went off the conspiracy deep end. He has posts including climate change denial transphobia nonsense about the great reset Second Amendment fears 2020 election conspiracies, and of course Holocaust denial. It's fair enough to say that he had a phase where he was into a presumably left wing hippie nudist lifestyle, but that ended a long time ago. I'm not sure if anyone really wants to call this the new January 6. It's an act. It's on a completely different scale from a mob invading the Capitol. But it would also be dishonest to not recognize some important similarities. Both events involve someone targeting Nancy Pelosi, at least somewhat in some capacity, they were motivated by conspiracy bullshit about the election being stolen. Both events involve people bringing zip ties, which gives some indication of an intent to take hostages. Honestly, the people who are responding to this in the same way they did to January 6 Are folks like Alex, the same knee jerk denial is being employed because this attack threatens him in a way. That's the same as January 6 did. It can't be allowed to be seen as the natural conclusion to his ideology and rhetoric because then as a society, we might wake the fuck up and start taking this stuff seriously. The extreme right wing community learned their lesson from how huge a setback the Oklahoma City bombing was to the ability for militia groups and extremist cells to organize. And they don't want to have to do that work again of renormalizing themselves, right? So they don't want something to be very well understood to be like, oh, yeah, this is this is kind of what you're gonna end up this is the end result of Yeah,

    | text      = This is how Alex gets away with the fact that his primary sources don't say what he claims they do. You can't read a document and just think it means what it says no, no, no. Before you read it, you need to run that document through the globalist filter. A Homeland Security paper might suggest extending refugee status to a larger number of people and you could accept that means that the author is suggesting that the US should extend refugee status to a larger number of people. But if you're able to think like a globalist then you can clearly see that what they're really suggesting is that hundreds of millions of unvetted immigrants should be ushered into the country. So they can be footsoldiers of the Democratic Party, right? Think like a globalist? Yeah, the game is really transparent, but honestly, I haven't heard Alex express it quite like this very often. You can't just read things, you have to read them using code. And for an added bonus, Alex is just made up these globalists and imagined what their plans are. So guess who gets to be the sole arbiter of how the code is translated? It's really nice. It's really convenient. Once an audience accepts this kind of bullshit, they're essentially allowing one demagogue to be their sole contact point with reality. Alex has appointed himself as the person who will have what amounts to the final say on whether something is real or not, in essence, demanding that the audience subordinate their own senses to him, right? It's really pretty abusive, but on another hand, it's just dumb. Context is important. And understanding the jargon that's used in various fields is critical to understanding how to read documents, but pretending that they're written in some kind of a sneaky code that only Alex's dumb ideology can unlock. That's a kid's game, he might as well tell the audience that he has a signed confession from Klaus Schwab, but it's written in invisible ink. Another critical issue is that Alex is basically the worst person you can trust about whether or not something is real. He has been completely wrong about pretty much every world event I can think of any lacks basic reading comprehension skills. He lies about his own past actions and beliefs constantly. And he's been tricked by fake documents multiple times, including the Soros Antifa contracts that one of his employees found on 4chan that he has to this day never issued a correction for Yeah, thinking like a globalist just means accepting Alex's version of reality, despite what your eyes tell you.

He's constructing an alternative reality based on nothing for his audience to live in. So they don't have to realize how much they have in common with the guy who tried to kidnap the Speaker of the House.
