    | text      = No, I I've, I've gotten a number of issues of the American opinion and what have you, John Birch Society, that collection is coming together indeed. And what have you and I started to think about, like, I want to, I want to start with a little bit of specialization. Because, you know, otherwise, we're just going to be randomly trying to find things and share how it makes the hunt a little bit more, more challenging, right, you don't have a real target. And so I decided that we're gonna begin by trying to compile as much as I can have revealed, oh, P all of her works. And I found some very terrible things. So surprising. He's written some real terrible, very, very anti semitic stuff. And the reason I chose to go in this direction, is partially because I believe that a lot of his ideas about the West, and the western man in Christendom and those sorts of things are very relevant to the right wing, as it exists now. And I think a lot of people don't have that thread to pull and maybe exploring that a little bit could be helpful. But then the other thing was that when you think about the John Birch Society, which is a cornerstone of the materials that are that are going to be in this thing and putting together the first meeting that they had the founding members that were there. A lot of these people were business, folks, they were industrialists, they were members of the National Association of Manufacturers, you know, the most fascists are sure. You had the Candyman sure out. Yeah,

And he's an ideas guy. He was, you know, he's a professor Sure. He's, you know, academic, he's somebody who has a lot of theory about stuff. And when, you know, you look at that constellation of people. That's the person that I find most interesting. That's the person who's gonna have more writings that have like, implications for maybe the way that the organization ended up growing. Well, yeah,

But he's very clearly trying to imply to the audience that they should think that the capture of Saddam was fake. All the external context that he adds to the coverage serves only to justify coming to the conclusion that it was fake. Alex points out that other captures have been faked before, which is supposed to make the listener feel like deciding Saddam's CAPTCHA was faked is a more rational act. Normally, you may notice that Alex is not doing this kind of insinuation in the other direction, providing defenses for the listener who may be inclined to think that the CAPTCHA was legit. That's because there is a conclusion Alex is driving it, even if he's trying to hide behind pretending that He's clueless and I don't know what to think.

So the second goal of this kind of thing, this kind of argumentation is to make an argument without having to own the fact that you made that argument. Alex is arguing that Saddam's CAPTCHA was faked, but he has every ability to pretend that he's not. If you were to say that he's making that argument, he'd be able to weasel his way out of that, by that it's pointed out, I didn't say that. Meanwhile, Alex has been saying that Saddam fled to Bella roofs with his kids and a bunch of gold ever since he was ousted from power. So if you're a person familiar with the content and narratives that are active on Infowars, at this point, you would know that what Alex is saying is not I don't know, he's saying like basically that he wants to call it fake, but he doesn't have the right talking point to anchor that claim yet. So he's gonna play dumb. He'll take a bunch of calls. And hopefully one of them will make a point that he can use to strengthen his conspiracy. But make no mistake, Alex isn't looking for information that will help him arrive at the conclusion that the capture was real. If that was the case, then it would call into question so many of his other narratives about the Iraq War, and the pieces would start to fall. It still needs to be fake in order for all these other things to be maintained. Yeah,
