Among the founding fathers, '''Thomas Jefferson''' is uniquely relevant to the podcast because Alex and his [[anti-communist]] friends are constantly repeating fake Thomas Jefferson quotes. This is such a pervasive problem that if you hear [[Alex Jones|Alex]] quoting Jefferson, there's better than even odds that it's not, in fact, something Jefferson said.

Other similar figures frequently misquoted by Alex include [[George Washington]] and to a lesser extent [[Winston Churchill]].
