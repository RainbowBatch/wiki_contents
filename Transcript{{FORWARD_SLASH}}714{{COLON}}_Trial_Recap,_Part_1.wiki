In the witness chair, there's water and glasses, you have pretty good volume, I don't think you'll need to lean into the microphones, I see that you have a document with you. I don't know if you were here when I explained to a prior witness who brought documents with them that you can't look at any document for any reason while you're testifying, and so on unless one of the lawyers or myself instructs you to do so.

Oh, my God, there were some things that were just kind of like, what do we do? And we have some things to talk about. Let's not get bogged down. Yeah, we're gonna be here a while. So ran all comes in with his first question. And one of the things that I think becomes abundantly clear really fast is that Alex does not appreciate the notion of not just being able to ramble, right? Yes, he was not a fan. It's one of the things that he has, it's the most sacred to him. And he does not respond well to being told you have to answer questions.

He's trying to monologue and control the entirety of the conversation because he goes, why wouldn't he think you should be able to? I find it hard to imagine the Renault has had any success ever trying to keep Alex on point. Like off the stand? Yeah. So why should this be any different right? At the end, Alex says that it's not fair that he doesn't get to talk but she got to monologue. This is in reference to Scarlett Lewis's testimony from just prior to him taking the stand. And there's a reason why she got to monologue as Alex, but it's because rain all knew damn well that he wasn't going to object an interrupter for as much of a shithead as he seems to be, I don't think right now is so detached from his humanity as to deprive Miss Lewis of her chance to speak her piece to Alex after all this time and him dodging the moment of having to look her in the face and hear her words. Yeah. Truth be told, Louis probably was a bit off subject at a few points in her testimony. And if rain all it objected, there's a really good chance that the judge would have no choice but to refocus the question asked, but he didn't do that. And that's what Alex is mad about. Yeah, not mad that she got a monologue and you don't that your lawyer didn't stop it.

And over that six, seven year period before I got sued, or six year period, it's clear, you can see the whole progression of us the few times we covered it, try to actually find out what happened. And that's really been my big frustration is that people have said that I personally tried to hurt them or coming after him when I questioned every big event. And a lot of times, it turns out that we've not been told the truth. And a perfect example, is today, where they play a 32nd or one minute clip. And I had just done that this morning. And I knew that I said, I believe that scarlet Lewis is real, and she's a really nice person. And she's really a sweet person. And then I went through and talked about her ex husband too.

He wants the jury to think that though he's a big, famous boy, now, back then he was really just a mom and pop talk show. Unfortunately, he's lying. He didn't just have a webcam on a desk. At that point, he had two studios, each with multiple camera angles available at any point, he also had more than just his show being broadcast daily since the Infowars. Nightly News was in existence at that point, the nightly news started in 2011. And it contained a bunch of content that's relevant to this very lawsuit like instances of Rob do covering Sandy Hook. Alex knows all this, but the goal is to create the perception that he really wasn't that big back then. So it couldn't have been him that was so influential in getting the Sandy Hook conspiracies rolling and causing the harm that was done to Neil and Scarlet. It's a fraud. And one of the telltale signs is him pretending a show he produced all the way to 2017 doesn't exist. It's nonsense. Never heard of it before. What's this?

What do you think's going to happen next? Are they're really WMDs in Iraq? Are they lying about it? And then the talk show hosts make their predictions about what they think. And then the talk radio listeners, basically keep note and see who's the most accurate, and it becomes a big game to see who has made the best predictions and things like that.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 01:13:55.000
    | text      = So this is disturbing because there does seem to be a pattern of Alex discussing his drinking as it relates to his actions involving Sandy Hook. We've seen it in an interview and now under oath and honestly, it's indicative of a very serious substance abuse problem. drunk or sober. Alex is an asshole and deserves the consequences of his actions. But I want to draw sharp focus to the difference in how Alex talks about the issue depending on his surroundings. Here in court, Alex is discussing his realization that Sandy Hook actually happened about some time in 2015. There's absolutely no prompt for him to bring up that he had stopped drinking for a while as an explanation for his supposed period of clarity. But he does, which leads me to believe that it means something to him. I don't think that it's true, but I do believe that he probably was going through a lot and stopped drinking for a while around the end of 2015. This is all being said in service of humanizing Alex and minimizing the things that he did. He was going through a lot and was drinking a ton but once he got sober he realized that he was wrong and changed his behaviors, except in reality he didn't. He was still doing his show wasted years. was past this point and he didn't change his behavior in any meaningful way. He still just ran with bullshit stories from bullshit sources and defame people regularly. But he wants the perception to be that this was just a bad pocket in his life when all these negative influences led him to drink and his judgment was weakened. He doesn't want the jury to know that he got right back to the heavy drinking and bullshitting with Steve Botanik basically the next week, because that kind of cheapens whatever fake display of penitence he's trying to put on here. But the other time Alex discussed his drinking in relation to Sandy Hook was a lot different. In the Glenn Greenwald q&a. Alex was joking about how he defamed grieving parents and caused immeasurable pain in their lives by saying that he didn't know what he was doing and drank a bottle of vodka that day. It wasn't a person expressing this as a negative thing. It was Alex trying to appear cool because he wanted to impress the cool kids like Greenwald, who can give them access to a new audience. I find this dynamic, deeply upsetting. And the only conclusion I can come to is that Alex was drinking on air a lot during this stretch, and that he probably as a way bigger problem than even I think, and I have been chastised for begging people in his life to get him help a bunch in the past. It's true. Anyway, a lot of this falls on deaf ears to me in a courtroom setting. Like I would take him more seriously if he took the tone that he did in the q&a while on the stand. But that's not gonna happen. Because there's no cool kids to impress them. Yeah. But if he was on the stand, he's like, Oh, I drank a bottle of vodka. You know, like, I would be like, All right. I'm just as interesting as being an asshole. How do you consistent?

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 01:29:51.000
    | text      = So Alex definitely wasn't the first to report on WMDs in Iraq and the question but all intelligence surrounding the story, even though he was correct to be skeptic We'll have that story. His skepticism was childish, and it was just a knee jerk response. It wasn't based on anything other than his own whim. So I guess he can brag that he got that one right. But he can't really take any credit for doing any work on the subject or even covering it competently. As we've seen his Iraq War coverage in 2003 is embarrassing stuff from the insistence that the bath party were being reinstalled to rule the country, while do bath of occasion was taking place up to his unsupported weekslong assertion that Saddam's kids weren't killed, and were in Belarus with their father, they still are to his really shitty coverage of David Kelly suicide, the larger picture that you get from that time as a person who's not really worth accepting as a source, it's not worth it. Now, he wasn't the only person saying that WMD intelligence was sketchy, and the other people who were expressing that opinion didn't overwhelm that accurate opinion, with an avalanche of embarrassing bullshit. As for Epstein, I really want to challenge this because I don't believe this at all. I've listened to Alex from a lot of periods of his career, and I've never heard him bring up Epstein except after larger media covered the story. I don't believe at all that Alex was covering Epstein, let alone covering him by name 10 years before the mainstream. I believe that Alex has convinced himself of his own bullshit, like we talked about earlier. From as far back as I can find Alex basically believes the Satanic Panic type stuff was real. Things like the McMartin school case, were actually real. And he based a lot of that off that and same shit that Ted Gunderson apparently had told him. I do except that Alex has talked about his fantasies of satanic groups kidnapping and abusing children for a long time. And I think what he's done is retroactively connect Epstein to that coverage. So he can claim us on the story all along, like how his first documentary was about the great reset. Right, right. I'm open to anyone providing me with evidence that Alex was talking about Epstein by name about his island and the sex crimes 10 years before everyone else. And if they do, I will reevaluate my position. But I've looked and I can find no evidence that this claim that Alex is making is true at all. I've even looked through the Alex Jones prediction section on his website, where he posts all the videos of him ostensibly being right about all these things way back in the past. I can't find any video of him being way ahead of the curve on Epstein. And thus this answer Alex's giving feels accurate. He's asked to say what he's most proud of in his career and what he comes up with his one story that half the country got right and the other is something that is almost certainly not true. There is nothing in his career to be proud of. He spouted meaningless bullshit for two decades. And I'll definitely applaud him for dragging it out that long, but beyond that, his career has meant nothing but other people's pain and in profiting from it.

Yeah, we did have that conversation and through the case and understanding a little bit more about what was going on, and, and all that, like my perspective has changed, in terms of like, oh, yeah, you said it was a false flag, like immediately. Yeah, basically, yeah. And had different incarnations of what his theories were and stuff. But I when I was approaching it with like, the most generous possible approach and rereading of things, I might have heard him say something like, why didn't the paramedics arrive or whatever? And not be like, Okay, this is him denying. And I think that probably when looking at the clip, there was like, he didn't say actors any Right, right. And I think that that that might be just part of how they are oblivious of what is being said to them.

I think a lot of people are talking about him saying this didn't happen. Right? What it is, is a na amorphous blob, all of what he has to say is denying that Sandy Hook didn't happen in a sense, like, okay, so he's saying I 100% believe it's real. But I questioned the official narrative, that is just part of the a amorphous blob of denying Sandy Hook. So when he says that what he's really doing is signaling that he's still denying Sandy Hook on whatever level he can cling to. So there will not be an A resolution where he says it's 100. It's 100%. Real, if he also says, but I don't question the error, but I questioned the official story, right?

    | timestamp = 02:16:48.000
    | text      = So this just isn't true. Retinol gave a defense in the punitive phase of the trial just as WestEd. For the plaintiffs, the DIA defense wasn't able to call any witnesses because the purpose of that phase of the trial was to determine net worth of both Alex and free speech systems. And after repeatedly failing to provide order documents and repeatedly sending in incompetent corporate representatives, the judge sanctioned Alex's defense by disallowing him from being able to participate in the net worth discussion at this point. Essentially, this is not a silencing or an instance of Alex being jammed up. It's just another case of him not doing the bare minimum he was required to do in the discovery phase of the case. And now it's too late for him to pretend he wants to be involved. Plus, Alex violated the rules on multiple occasions the prior day, including lying to the jury by saying he was bankrupt. So on that count alone, he should not be able to be a witness in this part of the case, he lied. Under oath, nothing that he said can really be accepted as credible. So his evidentiary value is zero unless he were to have produced the documents backing up what he says. Which brings us to the next problem. One of the primary things that was brought up as it relates to his text being disclosed was the messages from Tim fu J, which discuss detailed breakdowns of sales numbers. These numbers did not match the revenue numbers that Alex has claimed. And even more importantly, the existence of these texts, which are not turned over and discovery reveal an attempt to hide information relevant to the determination of net worth and the company's value. There are three major reasons that Alex is not being allowed to be a part of this phase of the trial, and it has nothing to do with the Democratic Party or conspiracy against him. It's the simple consequences of his stupid actions, you can probably get the basic tone of this announcement already. It's Alex taking this $4 million dollar judgment quite in stride because it's much lower than he was probably fearing. His tone is essentially no different than when he's gotten other bad news in the past, where he's using it as an opportunity to fundraise off of it, more or less trying to get the audience to flip the bill for him. So he can remain insulated from the consequences of his actions. It's pathetic, but it's what you'd expect, because he's always been able to do this before, whether it's his dad paying for the medical bills that Katie almost killed, or his dad buying advertising on his show. So a radio station would air him early on over the audience donating to his suspiciously timed money bombs, or this suspiciously timed $8 million Bitcoin donation. Alex has always had people to bail him out of the trouble of his stupid actions. And he probably thinks based on this $4 million figure, there's just gonna be another in that series. Yeah. And there's very little reason for him not to think that right?

And more importantly, Alex knows fully well that he's just lying to his audience. So they keep giving him money. And then also like the Scarlet has a great organization. His corporate representative Daria, under oath testified that she suspects that it's a front. Yep. Also, this is Alex's attempt to portray himself as the good guy, which is all based in bullshit. Further, he's putting Neil and Scarlet into a trap, where he's casting them as characters in his personal image rehabilitation. As far as the audience is concerned, they either get to play along and act how Alex is setting them up to which they aren't going to do or they'll be seen suspiciously by the audience all over again. Why aren't they speaking out in support of Alex after they realized that they were being used by the lawyers to attack the First Amendment? Maybe the evil lawyers won't let them? Or maybe they just said that to Alex to pacify him during the trial, and they actually are in league with the deep state Democrat lawyers after all, come to think of it, that would mean that they would have to put on a pretty good performance to trick Alex of all people. What if these people are actors after all, maybe that's not the direction it would necessarily go but Alex is forcing Neil and Scarlett to exist in terms of his bullshit show into the future because creating these fictitious pictures of them is helpful in terms of making Alex feel better about himself. What he really should be doing is leaving them the fuck alone which they've wanted all along. But Alex is kind of like a child who's broken something and then is trying to clean it up but he doesn't know how to clean so in the process, he ends up breaking more stuff. You just want them to stop trying to help because they're not helping him they're just making things worse, but they're a dumb kid and they don't get that he's kind of like that kid except he broke that original thing on purpose he claims that he didn't and then he's breaking other stuff to distract from the messy initially made it's like a sociopathic version of that kid who broke something Yeah, he's a fucking asshole.

And I'm sorry, it was a 10 minute rant. They cut it down to a minute with me saying it didn't happen. That's why the video was so blurry. You couldn't understand it was all blurry it was you couldn't even see me really it was just audio. Oh my god. And I almost and I said, Scarlett, go to the fourth segment, go to 40 go to 33. After my show today on stand. I said watch it. I said your reel. I said your son's reel. Whoever gave that to us a liar. She got up and left came back an hour later crying and was like who? Is she gonna be here? Right? I know. So so we broke through that they're being handled and manipulated. This was at the lawyer's then giving them edited video where she said on stand, I was given it by my supporters. So the point is they gave her a minute edited video. Imagine the sickos I'm on everything. I believe your reel. I believe your son died. I'm so sorry. I want to work with you. And I believe that your ex husband, son died and he's a great guy. I think they manipulated him. I think he's kind of simple, not dumb, smart, but very trusting. He's like a, I know he's a rodeo guy. He's a he's a cowboy, which are not dumb. They're just really trusting nice people. I have family like that.

We're going to Connecticut, we're meeting with them. We're supporting what they did. We're not going to be kept away from these families.

I think that saying we won't be kept from these families. is something that is so wrong. There Is that obviously the way he's trying to portray it is like me and the families are on the same side. And these evil lawyers are trying to keep us apart because of the power that we could have together in this unity and love and all this, which is nonsense. But the the real world, the place where the real world intersects with this bullshit is exactly the same kind of harassing behaviors, encouraging those from the audience. Because, you know, let's say that Scarlett or Neil or some of these other families don't behave in the way that you would expect based on Alex's rhetoric. Well, you should go talk to him. Why aren't they? If they're not allowed to? Well, these lawyers are keeping them from you. You got to know it, it lends itself towards encouraging harassment. And I, you know, beyond anything that, you know, we talked about in terms of the lawsuit. This response is, I mean, I agree with you as someone who has no legal background at all, I think this should be a cause for another action. Yeah, honest.
