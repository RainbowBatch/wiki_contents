Today, Dan and Jordan go on a time-traveling adventure as directed by Policy Wonk Jessie, who wanted to know what [[Alex Jones]] was up to on their birthday. As luck would have it, that date coincided with the day that [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] came to America and spoke to Congress. This sends Alex into a tailspin of uncomfortable Israel-related weirdness.
