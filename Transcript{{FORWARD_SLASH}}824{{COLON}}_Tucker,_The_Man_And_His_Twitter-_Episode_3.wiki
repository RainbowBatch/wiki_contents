That's the moment that Kennedy published a magazine article suggesting there might be a link between the rise in diagnosed autism cases and the ever expanding schedule of mandatory childhood vaccines. The day that story was published, Kennedy's reporting was considered so solid that two out sorry one simultaneous reporting stone and salon.com Unfortunately, neither one of them understood what they were up against. The pharma lobby rolled out the most ferocious public relations campaign in memory. And both publications swiftly caved both pulled the story and then disavowed in groveling as they did. No one in the national media bothered to explain why autism diagnoses had skyrocketed. If it wasn't the vaccines and maybe it wasn't then what was it? To this day, there has not been a convincing explanation. Instead of reporters just attack Bobby Kennedy.

    | text      = Tucker sure is having a lot of fun with details. Yeah, I was gonna say the piece that Kennedy wrote in 2005, was titled deadly immunity and he was making the argument that Thimerosal in vaccines were responsible for the rise in cases of autism salon didn't cave to Big Pharma pressure, they were bombarded with corrections and had to add five different major corrections to the story in the immediate days after publishing that an editor said quote went far in undermining Kennedy's expose a, the media didn't hate Kennedy for this article. If he's even hated at all, it's because of all the shit he's he says that's long debunked, and he just continues spreading the same bullshit, pretending that no one has provided any reason that he's wrong, right. And when that doesn't work, he just moves goalposts. If he'd published that article, then seen the corrections and said, Oops, my bad, then no one would be mad at him. It might lead to a reconsidering of his credibility and his ability to investigate things, but he would show a measure of goodwill, and people will be like, Man, whatever it happens. Instead, he's just doubled down and led tons of people down a really dangerous road. And guess what ding dong people not having an easy answer for the question of autism diagnoses doesn't mean that Kennedy just might be right. Because that's the game that Tucker's trying to play, insinuating that because no one's fully solved this issue that leaves some room that Kennedy could be right, he has given an explanation. Sure. And guess what else ding dong, there are a number of very well understood reasons why autism diagnoses have gone up. One is greater awareness in the wider population of the autism spectrum with a greater likelihood the parents, you know, will seek out appropriate care. And that'll likely come with a diagnosis. There's also, you know, some screening that people do in well child visits. Now, that wasn't routine before, but it's become more now. Yeah, there's also a number of other ideas like genetic predispositions, but the vaccine link has been investigated and found to be bullshit. And yet Kennedy pushes the same shit that he pushed years ago. And that's why people hate him and Tucker fucking understands this. It's nonsense. He's playing a weird game where maybe he's right. Yeah,

Tucker is acting like this guy is just out here noticing things and playing the role of an observational comic pointing out things that seem weird. Kennedy is not doing that. He's using his children's allergies to push his anti Vax worldview. There are a lot of theories about the rising number of people with allergies, but there isn't a full consensus on the matter. One of the most popular theories has to do with children being exposed to less micro organisms early in life than they were in the past. But there's another co founding factor that's difficult to deal with. And that is it way more people think they're allergic to things than actually are allergic. According to a paper published in 2018, in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, quote, currently, the majority of available data is based on self reporting, which generally overestimates food allergy prevalence by a factor of three to four. People aren't reliable reporters of whether or not they're allergic to something or really just don't like it, or maybe they got sick from it once and decided it was an allergy. I've been guilty of that. Even myself. Sure. I thought I was allergic to avocados. I think it was just because I got sick, eating some bad guacamole when I was younger, and I, you know, made a bad dataset. Based on everything else I know about Robert Kennedy, Jr. I am going to have some healthy skepticism about whether or not five of his children actually do have allergies. Yeah, maybe they do. Maybe they don't. But you the thing to note about this that is really important about the way Tucker is playing this game is he's acting like he's just asking questions, when in fact, Robert Kennedy is making very emphatic statements.

He's an outdoorsman of Falconer and a fly fisherman. He's interested in how nature works. He's curious. Not so long ago, these qualities were considered essential to the practice of science. All scientific discovery comes from observation and Pearson, patient watching. Without the willingness to put aside your pre assumptions and assess with honesty, the things you see and touch and smell the changes taking place right in front of your face. You can't do science. You can't create art, either or journalism or theology. You have to be willing to notice the obvious and they tell you you're not allowed to notice the obvious, okay, and you should be concerned. Imagine you're on a commercial airline flight. The plane is just leveled out at 37,000 feet, you're closing your eyes for a nap, and suddenly you smell smoke, and it's not your imagination. You can see it it's starting to fill the happen all around you. People are hacking and choking. The guy in the next seat has a napkin pressed against his mouth. And he's mumbling what sounds like Psalm 23 tell you the shadow of clearly the airplane is on fire. Okay, but almost unbelievably, no one has said a word about it not there's a ban on the flames acknowledging this. Everyone is silent. So in panic, you yell for the flight attendant. There's smoke in the cap, and you say as if she hasn't noticed. But she stares at you with heart eyes, shut up racist. She replies, that's a dangerous Russian conspiracy.

I want to talk about Tucker's metaphor, because I think there's something slightly off about Oh, yeah. In the context of talking about Robert Kennedy, the points of comparison are pretty obvious. The people coughing and the smoke in the cabin are things like more people having allergies, or there are more autism diagnoses than there used to be. Kennedy is seeing those things and pointing them out. And people are yelling him down as a racist or a Russian conspiracy theorist, when in actuality, he's just being observant and pointing out the things that he's seeing, and no one else wants to accept. But here's the problem with the metaphor. Kennedy isn't observing things and pointing them out, he's also ascribing a reason for the things happening, and he's wrong. He says that vaccine vaccines are doing all the things like causing allergies and autism. So in the plane metaphor, what he'd actually be doing is yelling at the flight attendant about what he's decided is causing the smoke in the cabin. But he'd also be wrong. Maybe Kennedy will be telling the flight attendant that the way landing gear installed, create fires, but in reality, it was just someone vaping in the bathroom, then Kennedy would start a lifelong, highly funded campaign to get rid of landing gear on planes, and then you'd marry Cheryl Hines. My point is that this metaphor is dumb. Tucker is trying to play fast and loose about what Kennedy does. He doesn't observe the world and ask questions. He has a dogmatic answer to those questions already in place. And whatever observations he does have are merely meant to prop up the already determined conclusion that he's based his life on Yeah, so fuck off.

Just to start in November 2022, Yale School of Public Health released a study that looked at excess death numbers across partisan lines. The authors found that the excess death rate was 1.6% for Democrats and 10.4. For Republicans looking specifically after the vaccine was released. They said quote, the gap in excess death rates between Republicans and Democrats is concentrated in counties with low vaccination rates and only materializes after vaccines became widely available. Other research has done that started to disambiguate these variables and look at vaccine refusal and health health outcomes. And it doesn't look great for people who are telling people not to get vaccinated and all likelihood 200,000 is a pretty fair estimate of the deaths caused by anti Vax profiteering during the pandemic and Tucker is most likely just really upset about that because those people's blood is on his hands too and Nino's it Yeah. But also like, he can always hide behind the impossibility of drawing straight lines between like, Why exactly did someone not get vaccinated you know, like, right did was it because of my telling them not to get vaccinated you can't prove that right is true. That is fair. That's probably why people shouldn't be charged for like manslaughter for disseminating misinformation. Sure,

He destroys DeSantis said that. Yeah, I think it was like 51% for him wanting something that sounds right. Yeah. That poll didn't have voting metrics for hypothetical Democratic primary. But the most recent poll that's available as Biden at 64% Kennedy at 17. And that was a Fox News poll. He so not not Biden favorable territory. Right, right. But But clowned?

He wants to hear positions on vaccines, psychiatric drugs, puberty blockers, reassignment surgeries, a long list of other politically fashionable priorities have no connection whatsoever to legitimate science. It's all effectively witchcraft. At the annual meeting of the American Medical Association Chicago last week, for example, delegates issued a statement attacking the body mass index as a tool of quote racist exclusion, which has caused historical harm. Next year, they will denounce thermometers and stethoscopes, they're insane haha.

    | text      = So the importance or significance of BMI or body mass index has always been kind of shaky. The idea of putting one number on body mass is a bit simplistic and the medical community is known about that for a long time. It's a foundation for a measurement that could be important, but it needs a lot of work to account for various things like fat distribution, age and ethnicity. The reason that it was called a tool of racist exclusion is explained this way in an article from The Washington Post from over two years ago. Quote, BMI was invented about 200 years ago in an era that saw the creation of pseudo scientific theories such as social Darwinism that was used to justify nationalism, racism and eugenics. The index index was established by Belgian mathematician Lambert a dove Juc quillette quillette, who sought to measure the height and weight of the average man based on a sample of white European men, right, he saw this average as quote, ideal, right, right, right. It's not a universally applicable number. But most experts recognize the BMI idea as a jumping off point for a measurement that could be more meaningful, but it just hasn't been developed. Yet. Whatever that more meaningful metric is. This isn't an instance of the medical community being insane unless you're a white identity zealot like Tucker, who thinks that everything about the world should use white people as the default and the ideal, then the idea of reconsidering that legacy might seem insane, like it does to Tucker. Yeah.
