Today, Dan tells Jordan about the 13th (13th?) installment in his investigation into what happened to get [[Alex Jones]] to team up with Team Trump back in 2015. In this leg of the hunt, nothing really changes about Alex's feelings about Trump, but he does seem to throw a considerable amount of his weight behind another nationalist strongman, namely Putin. This leads Dan into a sea of rampant speculation.
