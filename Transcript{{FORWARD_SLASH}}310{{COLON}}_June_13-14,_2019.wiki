So today, Jordan, we are stuck in the present. I know the world would not allow us to, to go back to our fun. Fun relatively, of talking about Alex in 2013. As is our tradition on Mondays, because as I predicted on our Friday episode, like we're recording this on Thursday, but I bet by the time this episode is out some really fucked up will have happened. There it is, I say soothe. And so today we're gonna be going over June 13, and 14th, which is Thursday and Friday of last week. There is a lot of messed up stuff that happens on these episodes. Some of it politically messed up some of it emotionally. So consider this a fair warning that some of this will not be pleasant to listen to. You have been warned. Okay, you personally and listeners abstractly Wonderful. So before we get to today's episode, and what it will entail, I must take a moment to say thank you to some people who have signed up and are supporting the show. We appreciate it.

I think there's a lot of war hawks, who have been looking for an excuse to attack Iran, they sure seem to have and I don't think that that means that they set this up or anything like that, either. No, I don't know what happened. I just think that calmer heads should prevail. So what as we talk about ALEKS covering this, that I am not coming from a place of saying it was Iran or it wasn't I don't know. Yes. The facts will bear out as they bear out.

And that it was Iran that he needs to figure out a way to be like, I know I say everything is a fucking false flag. But this one's gotta be real because Trump really wants it to be real. Yeah.

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 11:11
    | text      = That's like a semi semi wagon the single week, bi weekly, other way around. So the idea of a false flag is that a ship would attack another ship, and they will be flying a different flag than the country or group they represent. Instead, there'll be flying the flag of the group that they want it to be blamed for the attack. In the case of the sinking of the Lusitania, a German U boat did that. And they admitted they did it and Germany argued that the Lusitania constituted a military boat. So I'm not even sure where a quasi false flag comes in here. I guess maybe Alex could be referring to the Lusitania itself, changing its flag from a British flag to yet a US flag. In an attempt to Pier up, you're neutral, but that action is really irrelevant in terms of what happened. That boat was getting sunk no matter what flag it had on it unless it was a German flag. Yeah, so more importantly, Alex is misrepresenting history. pretty egregious ly here. First of all, the sinking of the Lusitania didn't start World War One. World War One started in July 1914, and the Lusitania sunk in May 9 1815. What Alex means is that the Lusitania sinking brought the United States into World War One, and there's another person that matters, but the way he seems to phrase it seems like he doesn't even recognize that people have been fighting and dying for a year in Europe before the ship sank. But even that thinking is flawed. The US didn't enter World War One until April 6 1917. So it makes little sense for the powers that be to false flag attack this boat than wait two years to follow through with the plan that that false flag allowed them to put in place. That's nonsense. After the Lusitania was sunk, Woodrow Wilson demanded to stop the sinking of merchant boats by the German U boats, and Germany agreed to cut it out. Then on January 31 1917, Germany announced they were resuming quote unrestricted submarine warfare. Wilson responded on February 3, that the United States would do nothing unless Germany committed overt acts against the United States. In the following two months, Germany sank nine American ships, none of whose name's Alex Jones even knows. Most historians agree that the sinking of the Lusitania was not the reason the US got involved in the war, but that it's remembered as the cost is belly. And the reason for that is probably classism. The passengers of the nine merchant ships sunk in the weeks before the US declared war were quote, low status, underpaid merchant mariners, whereas the Lusitania was a passenger focused ocean liner, which carried people have an elevated social standing. Here are the nine ships that were sunk by Germany that actually caused Woodrow Wilson to turn 180 degrees on his campaign slogan, which was he kept us out of war. So, it was the Housatonic, which was sunk on February 3 1917. Great name the Lyman M law, which was sunk on February 12. Great name the Algonquin sunk on March 12. That's actually a great name. Yeah, the vigilancia which was sunk on March 16. And that one actually had 15 crew members who were killed, six of whom were Americans, the city of Memphis, which was sunk on March 17, the Illinois sunk on March 17. Again, the Harold Tim sunk on May 21, killing 21 Seven of whom were Americans. That one is actually a 10th entry on this list. And because it was actually sunk by a mine and it probably or may not have been Germany, who was at fault, but it's still part of the reason why we enter Yeah, it got sunk. Everybody moved am seven Americans died, right. So it was in this time period, so it was definitely part of the consideration. Yeah, the Aztec just sunk on April 1, killing 2811 of whom were Americans, the Margarite, sunk on April 4, and the Missourian sunk on April 4 as well. Each of these boats as they were sunk. debate raged about whether or not they constituted overt acts of war by Germany. The first three involved no casualties, and in the case of the use of tonic it appeared that Lieutenant Hans rose captain of the Do 53 that sunk it. They had given the crew warning and then told them and lifeboats to a place where they could easily be rescued by a British ship. If Germany had continued to sink us boats in that fashion, there probably would not have been any legal justification for Woodrow Wilson to enter the war. The use of tonic was carrying foodstuffs meant for the Germans enemies, and under international law, they had every right to consider that contraband. The same sort of thing could be said for the lineman and law sinking. The crew that ship was warned in advance the ship was sunk, and the passengers were put in lifeboats and towed to land. It was a very courteous sinking, if there is such a thing. That's nice. But here's the thing. Those sinkings had happened pretty soon after Germany announced its intention to resume full scale submarine warfare. And in their announcement, they made clear that some of their ships had already launched before the announcement was made. And you might expect more lenient treatment from them than from U boats you might encounter in the future. Germany knew that this was one area where they had a real leg up on all other belligerent parties. But an essential problem was if they exerted their full force in the sea, the United States would end up getting involved in the war, they needed to be able to act with impunity in the ocean and not worry about us. So the best way to achieve that was to stir up some other shit that we would have to deal with. On February 24 1917, Woodrow Wilson received the Zimmerman note, a telegram that was intercepted by British intelligence from German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmerman to German ambassador in the United States, Johann von burst off. In the note Zimmerman requests that Bernstorff reach out to the German Minister of Mexico City to offer an alliance with them on the condition that they attacked the United States from the south. The offer was to involve a promise to give Mexico back land that was lost in the Mexican American War if they've gone along with this plan. After Wilson received that message, and the u-boat attacks continued and intensified, he was in no position to argue with the more hawkish side that had been arguing that past acts constituted overt acts of war. The next attack of the Algonquin on March 12 did not involve such courteous Germans, as we had seen with Hans rose. They didn't give a warning and they didn't help the stranded crew find rescue. But there was still a problem for the war hawks. In this case, the ship had recently transferred from British to American ownership right before the sinking. So it had gone from a belligerent flag to a neutral one since the war had started, which meant that it's sinking didn't qualify as a justification for war. Because there's every reason that Germany could have not known it was now an American ship or, you know, yeah, I get you when a German U boat straight up torpedoed the village vigilancia four days later and ended up killing American civilians in the process that qualified under international law as an overt act that merited declaring war. The subsequent attacks that reinforced they only reinforced that Germany was trying to antagonize the United States, it was not going to stop. And with the Zimmerman note, it was clear that they were also trying to promote attacks against us from our neighbors, which ended up justifying a declaration of war. The public arguments about the justification for declaring this war very rarely mentioned the actual ships that were sunk and change Wilson and his cabinets minds. Instead, they often revolved around the much sexier story of the British cruise ship that was sunk two years prior the Lusitania. That ship was never the reason the United States got involved in the war. But because blowhards didn't really care about the loss of working class lives, they use the Lusitania as a proxy to talk about the other ships. And thus that misunderstanding is carried down through history to people who don't look too much into stuff. People like Alex Jones,

It definitely does seem like the British government in particular, was eager to cover up something about that boat and it's sinking. But to claim that, you know, what that thing is reflects a little bit of hubris and a lot of assumption. One of the things that they might have wanted to cover up is that the British knew that the U 20. was nearby, and they didn't warn the Lusitania. This is a hugely consequential decision since they put civilians at risk. But it happened because the British had cracked German naval codes through their top secret intelligence operation room of 40. But they couldn't give the commercial ships specific warnings without risking tipping off the Germans that their code had been broken. Right. There are some strong indications that in the aftermath of the sinking, Winston Churchill may have been less than forthcoming about what happened at sea in an effort to protect room 40 from being exposed. There are plenty of lingering questions about whether or not there were munitions being transported on this boat full of civilians. And I'll be the first to admit that it doesn't look that great. If you look at all the details. The idea of potentially making your boat full of non combatants at Target is pretty unacceptable, but from everything I can tell this was not why the U 20. fired on the Lusitania at all. And if anything, it was only used as a after the fact justification for it. They did the sunset ship because it was their express purpose to be out Let's see, sinking boats like it right, I'm open to the idea that possible negligence led to the sinking of the Lusitania. But from all the information I have available, I don't see sufficient evidence to claim any kind of conspiracy existed to have the boat sunk in order to get the United States into World War One. That wasn't the result that came from the sinking. And the second is absolutely completely in line with what the German U boat campaign was doing at that time. They were at war with Britain and viewed Britain as an island nation that could be best defeated by aggressively isolating them by sea. Churchill had expressed a desire to increase neutral shipping traffic to Britain, in hopes of causing a flare up between the United States and Germany. You know, like, they'll attack these

So whatever goal he hoped to achieve from a US merchant ship being attacked by Germany wouldn't have been achieved by that boat being attacked. So in the end, this one's not good. Yeah, this one doesn't work. Alex believes that the Lusitania synth gig led to the start of World War One.

It sort of sort of done it set some of the conditions in place and was a spark, certainly, but he's expressly wrong about everyone being off the ship. The USS Maine had a crew of 355 men and when it blew up, 253 of them were killed, with eight more dying later from their injuries. There were 16 additional men injured leaving a total of 78 out of the 355 not injured or killed. And the survivors didn't survive because they were off the boat and they staged it. They avoided death because the explosion happened at the front of the boat and their quarters happened to be at the back section. Yeah, it was complete luck. On February 1 1898, the USS Maine blew up well docked at Havana Harbor. Immediately, debates flared up about what had caused the explosion, with many viewing it as the result of an accident where on the ship coal had combusted and lit munitions.

Others, notably Teddy Roosevelt, who was also pushing for war after the Lusitania sank, because that dude just loves wars, argued that it was probably a mind that blew up the USS Maine and we should attack Spain. In the immediate aftermath, neither side was really arguing from a place based on evidence, they were just using the event to push toward the result, they want it. Calmer heads didn't want things to Spain to escalate. And then people like Roosevelt were eager to start a war left to their own devices, these sides probably would have just argued between each other until a formal investigation had been done. And ultimately, the war may never have actually even happened. I base that assumption on the fact that President McKinley was not interested in declaring war. And the fact that the investigations that have happened since have generally confirmed the it was an accident. Yeah. In the 1890s, though, there was a bit of a media feud going on in the New York newspaper market between Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World and William Randolph Hearst of the New York Journal,

I mean, even if you're in favor of the cause behind their actions, you can still see the, you know, promotion of span Cuban independence in their papers, the way they did it as bad means towards a good end. Yeah, they'd been playing that game for a while and making a lot of money off it by the time the name sunk, so they were in an ideal position to capitalize off it. With no more information than the doves in the government or the hawkish Teddy Roosevelt. Both Hearst and Pulitzer set out to rally the public against Spain, explicitly arguing that Spain had sunk the main their public, their papers, pushed the slogan remember the main and did everything they could to advocate for war with Spain. They did this partially because they were biased in favor of Cuban independence, but more importantly, because it raised their profit margins. Now, it'd be stupid for me to sit here and argue that Hearst and Pulitzer were responsible for the outbreak of the Spanish American War. That would be fucking simplistic and delightedly irresponsible but it would be equally stupid to not recognize the part they played in it. Yeah, there was a piece of the puzzle that like they were massive propaganda Oregon's making up stories and sensationalized and kernels of real stories, intent on bending public opinion towards war.

So subsequent investigations, most notably one done by Admiral Hyman G Rickover. In 1974, we reached the conclusion that the explosion of the main was the result of unforeseen volatilities in the mains use of a new type of coal. The ship had previously used anthracite coal, but it just switched to bituminous coal, largely because that type of coal would be able to make ships move faster and sail faster. Unfortunately, it was also way more caustic and prone to spontaneous combustion. And this type of coal being present as well as the significant significant amounts of pyrite that were found leads to a strong indication that the ship suffered an accidental coal fire, the absence of any external evidence of like penetration from the ship from outside as well as the other signs you would expect to find. If it was hit by a projectile or a mine. It all really just strengthens that conclusion. Yeah, the sinking of the Maine was not a false flag. It was a horrible accident that was used opportunistically by propagandists looking to turn a profit off delivering stilted news in an emotionally compelling and dishonest way. I'm not saying that Alex is doing the same thing here and is basically the yellow journalism of the modern era. But I am saying there's probably a reason you'd rather call that a false flag than examine the actual forces that were at play during the time for sure. So do you think he's got another boat?

{{TranscriptBlock

    | timestamp = 29:51
    | text      = So the USS Liberty in case anyone is unfamiliar with that on June 8 1967, the Israeli Air Force as well as their Navy fired on an American ship, the USS Liberty as it sat in the Mediterranean Sea. It was in the middle of the Six Day War, during which the US was a neutral party, and the ship was in international waters. So there was really no justification for their acts. Israel said that they mistook the ship for an Egyptian warship. But a whole lot of folks don't trust that explanation. Their arguments largely hinge on complicated conspiracy theories that I'll get into later in this episode. For now, what I want to stress is that there's no possible reality where in Israel would have done what they did in order to try and trick the United States into war with Egypt, it would be a bad idea on their part. Well, one reason I can say that pretty confidently is that Israel almost immediately took responsibility for the attack and apologized for it. If there's any uncertainty about the why of the event, why it happened. There's no uncertainty about the who, and there wasn't any real cover up or attempts to make it look like the Jets were Egyptian crafts or anything. There's no way that the US would have had that attack happened. And Israel comes over and is like, hey, sorry about that. We messed up. And then they decide, alright, let's attack Egypt. Yeah, Alex believes that Israel's objective was to kill everyone on the Liberty. So there's no survivors. And they could just say that Egypt did it. This doesn't make any sense, since the airships were marked as Israeli. So if anyone on board the ship survived, or if any of them were able to radio, anyone, or if there's any ship nearby that saw what happened, the whole plan would be busted. Yeah, if they really were trying to set up Egypt, they could have easily mark their helicopters with Egyptian markers or just not had Israeli ones on them. One of the survivors testified that he could see the chips were Israeli from 2000 yards away, which would give them ample time to radio that Israel was attacking them. Given the technology that existed at the time, and each party possessed, it would have been impossible for the signal to be jammed coming out of the boat, and the Liberty was able to send out a distress call. So they would have been able to blow this false flag up. Even if every single person on that boat ended up being killed. Yeah. I'm not going to pretend that the Israeli military hasn't definitely used false flags before like in the case of the 1954 Lavon Affair. But looking at this case, it doesn't look like Alex's argument makes much sense. If only I knew where he was getting this information from?

Alex Jones fights against his programming. So the Gulf of Tonkin, he might have one there. What happened with the Gulf of Tonkin incident was that on August 2 1964, the USS Maddox engaged with three Vietnamese torpedo boats. Then the US lied about a second confrontation happening on August 4, which was just totally made up. Also, we lied about not having fired first in the August 2 incident. And it was all definitely part of trying to get more directly involved in Vietnam. So Alex is close enough for jazz on this one. Yeah. Honestly, though, him being right about this kind of makes things worse. Here's what I mean. You would sound crazy and paranoid, if you just insisted that everything was fake, because you had one example from 55 years ago, Alex needs to create the appearance of a pattern in order to justify thinking that everything could be a false flag. And that leads him to believe completely untrue. Things like the Lusitania sinking caused us to get into World War One, or that all the men were off the main when it was false flags sunk, he has to think that those things are false, too, because the reality of the Gulf of Tonkin incident isn't enough for him to justify his stupid way of thinking. Yeah. And, you know, no one disputes that the Gulf of Tonkin incident wasn't the case of wanting to get into war. But that's unsatisfying to Alex, because everyone already agrees with him. You're not blowing minds talking about the Gulf books, tons of books are written about it. The you know, fucking McNamara has gone on record and had been interviewed about it.

I looked all through Infowars. The closest I can find is, I mean, these are a little close. Maybe there's an article on Press TV from February 13 2019, where around vowed revenge against terrorist groups who attacked their guard troops and killed 27 of their soldiers. Right. That's, I mean, that's violent revenge. Yeah, I'll give them that. It's from close to the time period Alex is talking about uh huh. How the closest other thing I could find to that quote is Alec struggle that he's struggling to remember is an article in the Christian Science Monitor that seems pretty in favor of regime change. The title, the headline is, quote, why Europe is again, a battlefield for a Ron's internal wars. It's not that close, though, to what Alex is talking about, and definitely not what he's describing. I'm kind of at a loss as to what he's talking about. And even searching for those terms. Like I said, on Infowars itself doesn't pull up an article. I know

If you search for these words that Alex is expressing the closest thing I could find is a May 16 2019 article in Market Watch, which I do know Alex has cited a bunch of times in the past, so it makes sense that he would have read it. The headline is, quote, Iran's foreign minister responds to unacceptable sanctions by the United States. At no point in that article is the foreign minister Mohammad Zarif threatened retaliation, nor does he discuss soft targets. Those words only exist coming out of the mouth of Anwar Gargash, who's the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, saying that if civilian targets were hit, their Saudi led coalition would, quote, retaliate hard against Iran. Or there's a Reuters article from May 26 2016. That's reporting on something from Press TV. The headline is, quote, Iran Khamenei calls for vigilance against West soft war. That article doesn't say a single word about Hezbollah or unleashing terrorists or any of the stuff Alex is talking about. However, there is an article from May 19 in Reuters, where Ayatollah Khomeini says, quote, there won't be any war, the Iranian nation has chosen the path of resistance. We don't seek a war and they don't either. They know it's not in their interests. But that doesn't seem to be in line with Alex's reporting and I still do not know what he's talking about.

And he's leaving out a really important part of the statement that Iran put out. They said specifically that they would close the Strait of Hormuz if they were prevented from using it. It's a conditional statement. An absurdly high amount of the world's oil traffic runs through Hormuz, and Iran does control a large portion of that water area. Oman controls a fair amount of it on the other side of the strait. But if Iran, Iran were to be prevented from using their own waterway, it does make some sense that they would shut down they're part of it. The threat being presented as it's coming out of nowhere does seem extreme, but when taken as a conditional statement about their own waterway, it doesn't really seem all that out there. Right. Alex is later going to say that this threat they made to close the Strait of Hormuz was like they're gonna They threatened to blow up boats in order to fit what's going on in the present.

That's an article from the independent about an article and press TV, Alex would know this, if he paid any attention. If Alex was actually reading Press TV, then he would have read a different headline, quote, IRC G warns reciprocal action against US forces if labeled terrorist, also the articles from April 7, not April 9. So I mean, that's a little petty, but he's getting everything wrong here. This is an independent article. I read, I read the real stuff that you read. All you did. Is Google an article in The Independent you say it's from prestige. Are you translating it? No. I mean, it's an English Press TV isn't English, is it? Yeah. Or at least the the blogs, like blogs were like the website? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I read a bunch of stuff on it. Okay. So the article doesn't, it does include some vague insinuations that there would be trouble if Trump makes a decision to label the IRS eg a terrorist organization. But you really have to look at it in the big picture. The IRC G is a branch of Iran's armed forces, so labeling them as a recognized terrorist group is really close to declaring war on them. It would be like if France decided to declare the US Navy an enemy of their country. It's an incredibly hostile act from a geopolitical standpoint, for a country to respond by saying, if you do that you're crossing the line. And we just won't accept that. That's a normal response for a country to have. Yeah, it's not unfair to look at what the Trump administration did is kind of baiting. And also, that article doesn't say that they're going to sink boats or activate sleeper cells. If Trump labeled them a terrorist organization. It's specifically about putting an urgent motion through the government to label the US military personnel as blacklisted terrorist. Like the headline says, reciprocal actions. Yeah. This first article that Alex is bringing up doesn't nothing to prove his points. It's all just misrepresented. And you know how sloppy he is by him saying it's a Press TV article instead of an independent. So you know, he's dumb, and but he thinks he's cracked a code. You think he thinks he's got this?

So the state senator from Arkansas, Linda Collins was found dead in her home on June 4, police put a gag order on details in the case, other than to say it was a murder, which isn't all that suspicious considering she's a former state senator. she'd lost the 2018 primary. So at that point in her death, she was just a private citizen. But extending that courtesy to her is something that I think is appropriate for a police department to do and I don't think there's anything weird about that at all. Last week, 48 year old Rebecca Lynn O'Donnell was arrested for Collins murder. She was an active volunteer for Collins's campaign and the two appear to have had a friendly relationship. I'll wait until more information comes out on this to make a full decision. But it appears that this might be a state senate Celina type situation.

And somehow part of his argument that Iran did this attack last Thursday, is is completely dishonest, manipulative, and the only reason someone would act that way is if you're trying to saber rattle. There is no other reason to bring this into a modern conversation about what is happening unless you are trying to sway people into supporting war on Iran started a war in 2016. Those US troops that Iran detained they weren't in international waters. They had fucked up their navigation and entered Iranian territory, so they were detained. And guess what John Kerry called up his Iranian counterpart talked it out with a little bit of diplomacy, and the sailors were released 15 hours later, unharmed. This was a situation where our troops made a little mistake, and it was a faux pas that could have easily spiraled into something ugly, but because calmer heads were at the helm, everyone was able to talk it over it recognize there was no harm, no foul, this will never happen again. foreign policy in America has stayed the course. I mean, that's the kind of situation that could easily spiral out of control if people aren't able to discuss things if people aren't treating each other with respect and understanding that like I look I'm sorry, I know that's your water and we're not we're not allowed to be there.

All of this stuff about the saber rattling for war with Iran is fucked up and completely opposed to everything Alex has ever pretended to stand for. And I have some criticisms of that, for sure. However, in that clip, what he's presenting is another level of unacceptable. See, as he sees it, it would be no big thing for Trump to take out the mullahs in Iran and win the war. He kind of sounds exactly like the Neo cons before heading into her Afghanistan, Rach nude, so it would be easy. It'd be an easy thing for Trump to go ahead and win that war. Yeah, but there's a problem. Iran has secret Hezbollah terror cells, and literally every Western city that will respond to an attack on Iran by gassing everyone and burning down buildings. So I guess what you'd have to do is preemptively lock up all the Iranians just to be safe. And just like that, Alex has talked himself into the exact logic that led to one of the more disgraceful chapters in our history when we put Japanese people in camps because we were afraid of them. One of the reasons it's so important to respond like to things like this in a way that some might criticize me for being overly cautious. You know, if you think I accept that as a criticism that I'm making a leap in logic, but I think it's important to understand how easy it is for this rhetoric to make that jump. If Iran is wantonly attacking us. And it would be easy for us to win the war. If it weren't for the case that Iranian Hezbollah sleeper cells are in all of our cities, it follows that the solution Alex would propose is rounding up all Iranians in these western cities so they're sleeper cells wouldn't be would be neutralized.

That being said, as long as Alex is bringing up, that candy wants to put people in camps, it should be pointed out that the Daily Beast reported last week that Trump was planning on housing 1400 Detained immigrant children at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. That's pretty shocking and offensive to people, particularly older Japanese Americans, because Fort Sill is one of the camps where they were held during World War Two. I know that every day brings a new Alex Jones related horror and every day there's something new that directly contradicts one of his long standing positions. But this is profoundly disgusting. All he ever did in his career was yell about how the federal government was locking up him and his gun buddies because they were a threat to the New World Order. Now we have a federal government locking up children he's fucking silent. And when he does say anything, he supports it. I remember back when we were covering the 2009 episodes, Alex made a huge deal out of the idea that Obama was reopening a camp where Japanese Americans were held during World War Two and how this was the next step towards con weirdos being rounded up. Back then Obama was opening that camp as a museum as a memorial to remind us what this country did when we let fear overwhelm us. Today that reminder is dead. Trump is doing exactly what Alex lied about Obama doing and Alex doesn't say shit. But oh, the Democratic socialist who thinks that capitalism is necessarily exploitative.

It's using an Austin American Statesman article as a jump off point to complain that the Austin Independent School District is using some funds to quote boost student involvement in pride. The Statesman article does bring that up, but it's a much broader story than Alex is really interested in. What it comes down to is that the school district rents out some of its properties to churches who hold their services there. It's a really common thing and a lot of parts of the country and honestly, I don't think that's even really a big deal. The Comedy Club in Columbia, Missouri that I used to perform at rented out their space to a church on Sundays to make ends meet. I think it's the sort of thing that can be a really mutual mutually beneficial agreement and arrangement and a lot of cases

    | text      = In this case, however, one of the churches who rented out the Performing Arts Center in Austin was a church called the celebration Church, which preached a pretty anti LGBTQ version of the faith. They likened homosexuality to beasty reality and as much as their abominations that God is forbidden. Naturally, LGBTQ activists were not super thrilled at this church renting out school district space and protested them to be disallowed the space the Texas Attorney General pointed out that it would be against the first one amendment for the school district a government entity to discriminate against the church based on their religion. So it'd be a very complicated thing for the district to stop renting the space to them, but still rent space to other people. In an attempt to find a solution everyone can live with. LGBTQ advocates suggested that the church, if it was going to remain able to use school district space, then some of that money raised should be redirected towards initiatives that supported LGBTQ students and staff. The school board said, oh, yeah, for sure. That's a great solution. Yeah. So here's why it is a great solution. Since September, the school district has raised $182,000 from renting out their spaces, and they're setting aside $10,000 for LGBTQ students and staff, so they can maintain the status quo and be left with $172,000. To use for the school district. Right. It's really a win win solution for everyone, including the celebration church, everybody wins, right? Nothing in this story mentions anything about the ages of the students involved in the being bossed to pride or any of that stuff. Austin Independent School District includes schools covering pre K to high school, so it could just be high schoolers. But because it's a school district, they can't like even if it's anybody, they can't do shit without parental permission slips in, like in the case of younger students, their parents probably have to come along with them. It's not like you're luring fourth graders 10 year olds to pride on their own without parental permission, guardians, and part of that $10,000 is protection. It's like, you know, you can't take kids to you can't take kids to the St. Patrick's Day parade for a school thing without chaperones and security. Yeah,

But it's also a group that can't kick out without causing a huge legal battle. So they decided to make a symbolic gesture of support to make things make it easier for students and staff to participate in pride. If anything, the headline here is Austin ISD has good intentions.

If you're listening to his justification for why he believes that this was a real attack and not a false flag, it all boils down to the fact that Iran said they were going to do X action, then x action happened. That's all good. And well. And generally speaking, what he's talking about is a threat. If someone threatens to do something, and then that thing happens, it's generally a good idea to start your investigation by checking on the person who made that threat. But Alex isn't starting his investigation there. He's ending his investigation there. They said they were going to do it. Therefore, it's not a false flag. If you apply that logic to the broader spectrum of the things Alex has covered in his career, literally everything falls apart. One of the biggest career making issues for him was the argument that 911 was a false flag. But if you use this investigative technique that he's currently using about Iran, he should have immediately come to the conclusion that bin Laden had carried out that attack

By Alex's estimation, that means it is not a false flag. Alex Jones believes that Timothy McVeigh was set up and the Oklahoma City bombing was a false flag meant to demonize the Patriots, but tons of people have testified to the fact that Timothy McVeigh was going around discussing his plans before the bombing, and he'd even written to threatening letters to the ATF before putting his plans into action.

Anytime a Muslim or immigrant hurt somebody that's definitely not a false flag, because Alex wants his audience to fear and hate those people. So their crimes are all definitely real. They definitely happened. In this case with Iran, Alex's meal ticket Trump wants to attack Iran. So he knows that he needs to find a way to fall in line with that. And this is probably his best bet as a justification. It was a false flag is not a good argument. It's not something that you can just kind of feel out. It's not something that you can determine for one or two coincidental details that shows a deep disrespect for reality and research. False flags definitely do exist. But my sense is that they're exceedingly rare. And they are it's not just an explanation for everything that's inconvenient for your worldview. The mythology of the false flag is something that allows certain a certain subset of bad thinkers and bad actors to hijack reality. They latch on to the fact that yes, some false flags have existed in the history of the world, and extrapolate that out to imply that it means that everything is possibly fake. Once you internalize that idea, events are no longer events. There are pieces of a story that's being told and it needs everything needs to fit with that story that you believe is being told. Alex believes the government is evil and militia Patriots are always good. So when Timothy McVeigh blows up the Murrah Building, it's imperative to find a way to make what happened fit the story you're already telling. This event is too threatening to the narrative. So you rewrite it as if being a patsy. And before you know it, everything fits, you have now made the story fit, the government looks even more evil in the militia patriots look even more good. This is all false flags mean to Alex, there are a crutch that he uses to hobble his broken down narratives along, but there are a crutch that's packaged in the sexiest of wrapping paper, the wrapping paper that just says What if over and over and over and over again? So what I'm saying is this, this is my point. Be skeptical of things, obviously, absolutely be skeptical. Ask the questions that you want answers to. But for your sake and the sake of public sanity, don't start out from a position of thinking most things are probably fake, and then trying to work backwards and try and justify your suspicions. That is the psychosis that Alex discussed having in those Sandy Hook depositions that everyone took out of context, right? That is what leads to that, that kind of trap, right? So I just longer and longer we do this. And the more I read and the more I understand things, the more it just becomes clear that this is not a sincere belief system. It's not a sincere worldview. It's a tactical, and I don't know how conscious that is on Alex's part, I think I think I think there may be a piece of it that is, but I think it might just be he's done it for so long. It's ingrained. And

Yeah, it's upsetting to hear that Alex is basing his perception that the USS Liberty thinking it was a false flag is based on an interview we did with Admiral Thomas Moore. You really hate to hear something like this. For one thing, Thomas Maurer is literally the Commander in Chief of the Pacific fleet at the time of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. So if Alex is going to argue that that incident was a false flag, Maurer was absolutely the person who was working behind the scenes 100%, Commander in Chief of the fucking Pacific Fleet during the Gulf of Tonkin.

All of it should really put him squarely in the box of villains in Alex's world, but weirdly, he's not. You know, he could be used by Alex to reference about how the USS Liberty was a false flag, but mysteriously doesn't seem to have anything to say about the Gulf of Tonkin. It seems odd weird. Thomas Moore was the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1970 to 1970. before and he has a resume full of impressive titles on paper. However, if Alex interviewed him right before he died, he would have been 91 years old. And even assuming his brain was all there, the best case scenario for someone in failing health who was born in 1912 is generally not so great. At the time of the USS Liberty attack, Maura was just beginning his three year stint as the chief of naval operations after having already served 34 years in the in the services, and was three years past the Gulf of Tonkin incident at that point, he had been a pilot in World War Two and he had received a Purple Heart as the result of his plane being shot down by a Japanese attack. He survived the crash and was rescued by an Australian ship which was then sunk by the Japanese as he tried to survive in a lifeboat he was being shot at in the water. Later in life, you had testified before Congress about the need to provide troops with adequate, adequate machinery, since the cause of his crash was that a bullet hit the unarmored fuel tank in his plane? He replied to suggestions that providing extra protection was a waste of money saying that perspective quote is great until you're in the sea and someone is shooting at you. You've got a different view, which is a fair point. Yeah, yeah, I would say so. can't really argue. Now this is very interesting, because this is a piece of Moore's personal life story that matches the story that's told by conspiracy theorist about the sinking of the USS Liberty that they claim proves that it was a deliberate, prolonged attack. They say that the Israeli forces were shooting at the crew as they tried to leave the ship on lifeboats, which is matching Thomas Moore's life. The problem is that the investigations and sworn testimony of the crew and the survivors of the Liberty in all of that that sort of thing isn't mentioned once. In fact, Captain McGonigal testified that he had ordered some crew members who were lowering lifeboats into the water to stop not because they would end up getting shot at but because there was no danger that the boat would sink and who knows if they might need the lifeboats later.

They only begin to pop up later, when some of the crew members begin making media appearances and start directly contradicting their prior sworn statements. It will probably be impossible to prove this. But some might say that this change in perspective might be the product of anti Zionist sentiment becoming much more popular in the United States through the 70s and 80s. With the term Zionist occupied government or Zog being coined by neo Nazi Eric Thompson in 1976. Two years later, the term would be featured in William Luthor Pierce's book The Turner Diaries, which would go on to inspire countless white supremacists and anti Semites, including Timothy McVeigh. The book also inspired the white supremacist outlaw group the order, who helped bring the term to a much wider audience in 1984, when members of the group murdered prominent Jewish radio host Alan Berg in the late 70s and early 80s. The sentiment that Israel controlled the US government they met began to creep out of the sewer of just plain old white supremacist groups into slightly more mainstream consciousness. And as it grew, it sought justification. The attack on the USS Liberty is a prime example of an event that was recast to fit the mold of the US government bending over backwards to allow Israel to attack us then going out of our way to cover it up for them. So no one finds out that the government is really Azog the subsequent investigations of liberty event and found that it was a mistake and a series of miscommunications, who were responsible for how things played out. Well, all investigations except the one. That was an unsanctioned investigation, headed by Thomas Moore in 2000. Great Great, great, cool, cool, cool, cool when he was 90 years old,

And were virulently anti semitic at the home, probably, but you don't realize that it is, you know, it's presented as something else, right. So that that kind of idea gives me a pretty good picture of, at least the way Alex experienced his childhood.

No two ways about it is absolutely Iran. They couldn't have got that mine out of the boat unless they knew about the mind ahead of time and knew how to defuse it otherwise, it would have blown up on the map. brackin it is Iran.

It's one thing for a news program to talk to both of them like I could see a credible news program talking to my brackin and Joel Skousen. Back to back, you could do that. Maybe you'd have to maintain an objective position. Yeah, it's a totally different thing for this news person, this hypothetical news person to talk to both of them and have the audience witnessed them both, like within the span of 1015 minutes, be convinced of contradictory things.

    | text      = And I know what they do. When you expose them, they say you're a pedophile. We knew it was coming. And when the Obama appointed US Attorney demanded out of 9.6 emails, 9.6 million emails in the last seven years in Sandy Hook metadata, which meant tracking the emails and where they went, well, we fought it in court, the judge ordered for us to release a large number of those emails. That's Chris Matty that got that done. Very interesting individual, the firm of cost coffin Koskoff run by Senator Murphy. And Senator Blumenthal that say, for America to survive, quote, I must be taken off the air. It's the very naked about what they stand for. So, you know, I had tried to set me up with the Russians. And I reported to the FBI, and that kind of freaked them out a lot. And that's all on record has been covered on national news. It hasn't. So that didn't work too well. And so we learned in just last few days that when they wanted these hundreds of 1000s of emails out of the 9.6 million, that they had attachments to them that no one would know what they were we hadn't opened this. The FBI has come out and said I'm the victim. And the statements coming out officially the US Attorney's Office in Connecticut. But what's interesting as we checked with real IT people, isn't it folks, we made some calls. They said no, you would know what was in attachments and you wouldn't know what they linked to because they haven't yet looked at they said we're the victim. It was hidden in Sandy Hook emails threatening us. Those child porn show, it's on record. We were sent child porn. We're not involved in child porn. But the fact is, it's not a needle in a haystack, it's fields of haystacks and they get these emails a few weeks ago. And they go right to the FBI and say, we've got him a child porn, the FBI says he never opened it, and he didn't send it. And then they act like, Oh, they're our friends, they're not gonna do anything with this. Go to hell. I wasn't born yesterday, I was born in the dark, but it wasn't last night. So whatever's going on, I'm offering a $100,000 reward, not 10,000 a $100,000 reward for the arrest and prosecution. And I've had $150,000, bonuses and contests before, so I pay $100,000, we're going to release the metadata in the next few days on infowars.com, for the email address that company, and the folks at the company are going to track it back. And they're going to find out, and we're going to pay the $100,000. And you're gonna go to prison.

    | text      = So first of all, I want to say immediately that I don't believe based on the information that's currently available that Alex is lying, this kind of accusation pretty serious stuff. And it does seem entirely plausible to me that someone could have sent him some malicious files. If more information comes out. That you know, I reserve the right to update my position. But for now, I have no tolerance for people saying this proves he's guilty of anything. I understand that it's my lot in life to be overly fair to Alex. But I don't think that this is an example of that. I think it's seeing that this is one of the few instances where he does make sense that someone would do that to him. And things have played out this way it makes remix. I see it as a possibility. And if that is the reality, I think it's very unwise to play into Alex's ability to make propaganda out of his own victimhood. From the way he's talking, I can barely track what he's saying happened. It seems all over the place. But it seems to me that he's saying that someone sent him threatening emails about Sandy Hook that contained attachments that included illegal pornography, his team didn't see them, it didn't notice them until they were handed over as part of a batch of emails that were deemed relevant to his lawsuit in Connecticut. From there, the FBI has said that Infowars isn't under suspicion. That seems to be what he's saying as his narrative. And admittedly, it's all coming from him. So there's a grain of salt aspect to it. But honestly, it seems plausible as a series of events. Let's not just say it is what happened. Shit, I'm not even certain that any of this exists, it could be a PR stunt. But the position I'm coming from is very much one where I think it's wise to exercise caution. Now, Alex's narrative about this, it's going to develop over the next couple of clips, is that he believes that the people who are suing him in Sandy Hook sent them right, and that that's the only way they would have been able to know where to look to find it to take to the FBI. Yeah, when in reality, that is a really shitty assumption, because any kind of data analysis firm would be able to run scripts on large amounts of data. You know, like there are people that specialize in this sort of thing. Yeah, it would not be something that would be a needle in a haystack, it would be if you were manually searching through emails, yeah. But because of algorithms and programs that people can run, it is the sort of thing where you could look for suspicious things. And it would I don't believe for a second, but you wouldn't be able to find that if you had, even if you had a million emails, the idea of being able to process it through in like a week. I think that's very doable. Yeah. So that falls apart a little bit. Now, all this being said, this contest seems like a weird move. And probably it's only something you would do if you didn't think this was a real thing. For one, Alex can't afford to make this kind of a payout. Secondly, if the FBI is on the case, I think they got this shit covered. You don't need to crowdsource an investigation when the actual investigators are investigating it. If this were real, I would really, really think that the FBI would say don't comment on an active investigation seems like it would get in the way. Now, whether or not this is real or not, I think what he's doing is super irresponsible. Assuming that he does release some of this metadata or whatever he has, what's going to happen if one of his listeners could figure out whose IP address it came from the FBI already knows who that is? Assuming any of the stuff Alex releases actually leads back to a person which it may or may not all he's doing is increasing the possibility that that person is hurt. And this matter is not dealt with lawfully. There's legitimately no reason to do what he's doing right now. But I don't think that it's some kind of guilty conscience. I I don't think that that's a fair assumption to make. I don't think he's trying to cover up anything. I think it feels more attention hungry than anything else. So I don't know what the reality of the situation is. But the fact that he's making a contest out of it strikes me as he's not too worried about whatever it is, and doesn't seem all that worried about the consequences of him doing something like this. So in this next clip, he talks about how people who have threatened him in the past have gone to prison. then. And then things really spiral completely out of control.
