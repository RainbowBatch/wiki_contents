'''DeAnna Lorraine''' is a failed Congressional candidate and [[InfoWars]] guest. During the 2020 election season, she spent a lot of time hanging out with InfoWars, including appearing at [[Alex Jones|Alex]]'s [[404: Mr. Jones Goes To CPAC|very sad CPAC counter-programming event]].

She was running in a very blue district and never had a realistic shot at even getting out of the primary -- in the end, she finished with less than two percent of the primary vote<ref>https://ballotpedia.org/DeAnna_Lorraine</ref>.
