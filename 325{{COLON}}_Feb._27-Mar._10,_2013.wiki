Today, Dan and Jordan return to the past to continue their investigation into what Alex Jones was up to in 2013. In this installment, Alex goes on a vacation, so he's out of studio for a week, but before he leaves, he references an obscure and very insane pastor, which naturally sent Dan down a very weird rabbit hole that may be very revealing.
