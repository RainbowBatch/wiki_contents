'''Glenn Beck''' is a prominent conspiracy theorist, former Fox News host, and founder of TheBlaze radio network.

Especially in 2009, Beck was a frequent foil for [[Alex Jones]].

As discussed on the podcast, many personalities in the conspiracy space like to make themselves appear more reasonable by comparing themselves to someone even crazier sounding. Alex has in the past done this by claiming that [[David Icke]] is a "turd in the punchbowl"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvpiVt47FaI&ab_channel=infoderp. On the other side, crazier people can punch back by claiming their more "reasonable" seeming critics are "controlled opposition" or otherwise secretly enemies. This allows them to try and cash in on the popularity and audience of their critics without compromising their stated views.

During the 2009 period, Glenn Beck was critical of Alex's extreme claims because it helped him appear more mainstream (despite his own ridiculous views). Since Glenn Beck had a much larger audience and influence, it makes sense that Alex continuously engaged with Glenn Beck.
