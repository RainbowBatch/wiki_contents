How about Trump bans people from any country that throw gays off buildings? And the government's openly certify it and say it's good. How about people are banned from any country where women have to wear hoods over their heads? Oh, but the media spins the whole thing. And they sit there and they say Oh, well actually, the answer here is a we should all wear hijabs. This is a sign of feminism. So the West is horrible and evil and all over the country at campuses. They're having no whites days run by the faculty, creating total racism and division under multiculturalism and the bringing in on compatible most radical forms of vile Islam. That is a true cult. Islam, in its orthodox Wahhabis form is the biggest, oldest, most dangerous, murderous, incompatible cancer is called on the planet, but they have official UN videos and German TV. They're rock stars and their music stars. First wearing turbans and going I wear the HUD tube, it's fun, the next it's a real hardship. And then it's a beekeepers job.

Because we know our government, and the left and the globalist in the Ford Foundation is out there financing and fomenting every uncomputable a system, every authoritarian system ramming into our countries, let them have their way with us. So that they can then turn around and say, Oh, we got to surveil all you have to control the internet, we have to censor everybody all we have to take your rights away. Oh, we got to get rid of this and that and everything else got to have all this happen. Meanwhile, England won't let its citizens have guns to defend themselves. And they bring in absolute, murderous scum who are admittedly part of jihad groups who fought in Libya, and fought in Syria, overthrowing those countries and murdering people, and then they bring them back and wonder why they're killing people. And Trump says if you fought for ISIS, you shouldn't be allowed back in the country. How about you should be dead? How about instead of deport these people that fought for ISIS?

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:56:25.000
    | text      = right? Well, the thing is, it's called The Day of absence. And here's what they how they describe it. The idea for the day of absence came from a play of the same name by African American playwright Douglas Turner award, presented in 1965 as a reverse minstrel show. Black actors and white face write the play is a social commentary on race relations in the US, and satirizes the South's refusal to see African Americans as equal members of the community. In the play, a town wakes up to find all of its African American citizens have disappeared, leaving those who left to reflect on the meaning of their community without these essential members. The day of absence as it was originally known began in 19 1970s, when faculty member Maxine Mims, inspired by the play approached administrator, Administrator stone Thomas, about the idea of joining with other faculty and staff of color and spending a workday away from campus as a grassroots collective action. In the decades following day of absence grew to become an opportunity for all students, faculty and staff at Evergreen to explore and celebrate the richness of our diversity by facilitating conversations about issues of difference in 1992, Day of presence was added in order to reunite the college community and honor diversity and unity as a whole campus. So that's basically what what it is, yep. Do you have this sort of thought experiment, this sort of experiential thought experiment, where in one group is absent from your entire surroundings and you start to remember it, you start to realize more of like, Oh, these these other folks who I take for granted, who just are sort of window dressing, perhaps they're actually an integral part of my life, and you start to appreciate the more it's not some sort of racist gesture. It's quite literally the opposite.

We've been doing this since the 70s. Yeah, there's just a thing. It's, you're depriving students of this experience. So everyone got mad about it, right. And then a bunch of racists started calling in terrorist threats. Oh, bunch of people started calling the police station saying they were gonna show up on campus with a gun and start executing people. And they had to shut down their campus for a couple days. Yep. So the actual thing has been going on peacefully since the 70s. And I'm sure a lot of people have gotten a lot out of it. And now because of the fucking climate that we live in, people start talking about it. And idiots enter the conversation and start making threats.

So you can actually take this clip later put it out as a video to the general public, not just our great audience of radio affiliates and TV stations of folks watching live right now on infowars.com. I deliberately this morning thought about how do I trigger a debate about radical orthodox Islam tenant being kill everyone outside of Islam? That's why they're constantly killing other Muslims that they catch drinking or who are gay, or lesbian or whatever. And I'm not even a gay or lesbian activist. I don't go to gay Oh, no, you're not those people. You're not gonna be able to have their own I'm upset my Islam running around killing them in mass. And then you wonder why Islam continues to attack the gay bars, and the little teeny bopper, Andreea grande liberal events. And they said, We don't like a bunch of young women are dancing around them without male escorts. We're gonna kill them. That was a sinful event, teenage girls. They're listening to another woman posing as a teenage girl who quote hopes her effing fans die. Ariana Grande, a true pig like creature. And there we go. They're there. They get killed, and the media tries to cover up that it's Islamic, the usual thing. And so yes, I'm saying, Trump's being called a radical for banning seven countries where they don't have real passport systems, and many of them failed states like Libya, thanks to Hillary and Obama again, failed states like Somalia. On and on and on. We accept the weirdo passports that are issued by the caliphate.

But they were wrestling around a little bit, and one of them got a little bit too, thought the threat was way worse than it was in the fight. We were all just drinking having a good time in the backyard. And the guy who thought it was a little more serious, grabbed a bottle and hit the other one in the head with it. Luck, thankfully, didn't get hurt too bad, just sort of bleeding from the face a bit. But it was super fucked up. It was like you disproportionately responded. That's what a lot of people do. People who have really bad fear control mechanisms, right? People who think they're victims at every point in their life, they are going to respond way more aggressively than they need to. And Alex Jones, I have to believe literally just said that's what he did. Yeah, I don't believe this person was bashing his head into the ground? Absolutely not. Now, if you talk to my friend who hit the other guy with a bottle, I'm sure his version of it would be he was gonna break my arm or something like that, right? Because you have to you have to justify because I don't think that the guy nuts like my friend who hit the other friend with a bottle isn't necessarily a super violent, bad guy. He's just not in control of his panic mechanism, right? And when someone acts out of their own principles and acts based on panic, often you do fucked up things. And you want a justification for it. You want to be like, Oh, well, I was gonna break my arm. So I had to respond. This guy who's gonna kill me I had to hit him with a brick.
