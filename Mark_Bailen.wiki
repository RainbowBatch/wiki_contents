'''Mark Bailen''' is a lawyer formerly at BakerHostetler LLP<ref name=":0">https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/biglaw-firm-getting-dragged-for-representing-alex-jones/</ref>, and former lawyer for [[InfoWars]] ([[Free Speech Systems LLC]]) or [[Alex Jones]].

The specifics are a little unclear because it seems like Mark wanted to keep his association very low-key. It's known that Bailen was discussing [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|InfoWars legal matters]] with [[Eric Taube]] in 2018<ref name=":1">[https://www.amazon.com/Sandy-Hook-American-Tragedy-Battle/dp/1524746576 Williamson, E. (2022) ''Sandy Hook: An American tragedy and the battle for truth''. New York, NY: E P Dutton.]</ref>. Elisabeth Williams' book about [[Sandy Hook]] suggests that Bailen himself says that BakerHostetler stopped working for InfoWars in 2020<ref name=":1" />. BakerHostetler and Bailen may have parted ways shortly after Bailen's involvement with InfoWars became public; some blogs have speculated may have been a parting on rocky terms<ref name=":0" />.
