'''Mark Bailen''' is a lawyer formerly at BakerHostetler LLP<ref name=":0">https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/biglaw-firm-getting-dragged-for-representing-alex-jones/</ref>, and former lawyer for [[InfoWars]] ([[Free Speech Systems LLC]]) or [[Alex Jones]].

The specifics are a little unclear because it seems like Mark wanted to keep his association very low-key. It's known that Bailen was discussing [[Texas Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Heslin v. Jones)|InfoWars legal matters]] with [[Eric Taube]] in 2018<ref name=":1">[https://www.amazon.com/Sandy-Hook-American-Tragedy-Battle/dp/1524746576 Williamson, E. (2022) ''Sandy Hook: An American tragedy and the battle for truth''. New York, NY: E P Dutton.]</ref>. Elisabeth Williams' book about [[Sandy Hook]] suggests that Bailen himself says that BakerHostetler stopped working for InfoWars in 2020<ref name=":1" />. BakerHostetler and Bailen may have parted ways shortly after Bailen's involvement with InfoWars became public; some blogs have speculated may have been a parting on rocky terms<ref name=":0" />.

Bailen's wife is Jessica Rosenworcel, chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission under both Biden and Obama. Rosenworcel commented that she and Bailen lead "very separate professional lives" when confronted with his association with InfoWars<ref name=":1" />. In a notable but meaningless coincidence, a strong supporter of Rosenworcel's appointment was Senator Richard Blumenthal, father of [[Matt Blumenthal]], who is counsel for some of the Sandy Hook families in their [[Connecticut Sandy Hook Lawsuit (Lafferty v. Jones)|Connecticut Lawsuit]].
