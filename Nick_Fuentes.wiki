Nick Fuentes is a far right political figure, antisemitic firebrand, and holocaust denier in American Politics. He's very young, but has already been pretty successful at organizing a political movement (the "Groypers"), was on the capitol grounds during the January 6th insurrection (although he was smart enough to not enter the building and has so far gotten away without consequence), and rubbing shoulders with high profile individuals, like [[Kanye West|Kanye West / Ye]] and [[Donald Trump]]<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/25/trump-nick-fuentes-kanye-west</ref>.

Knowledge Fight covered Nick Fuentes in detail on [[404: Mr. Jones Goes To CPAC|Episode #404]], after Nick crashed Alex's CPAC 2020 appearance.

In December of 2022, Nick appeared alongside Kanye on InfoWars to spew wildly antisemitic hate.
