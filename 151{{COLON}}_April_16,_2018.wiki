===Guests===

*'''Gerald Celente''': "Trends forecaster." Celente is, much like all of Alex's "financial guests" like [[Harry Dent]] or Peter Schiff, only on the show to spread pessimism and dread about the state of the economy. Though the numbers look good, don't trust them! He has a rich history of predicting market collapses on Alex's show, and then they never happen.
*'''Paul Craig Roberts''': Roberts was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy under President Reagan in 1981, and after that became an editor for the Wall Street Journal and a Distinguished Fellow at the Cato Institute. Since at least 2014, he's been a columnist for [https://russia-insider.com/en/paul_craig_roberts Russian Insider] and [https://sputniknews.com/authors/paul_craig_roberts/ Russian state-owned outlet Sputnik], writing articles with titles like "America Has No Unifying Moral Culture-It Will Lose A War Against Russia," "Will Putin Realize That Russia Holds All The Cards?" and "Privatization Is The Atlanticist Strategy To Attack Russia."

===Narratives===

This show is perhaps one of the most soul crushing in recent memory.

After Alex Jones got on air on Friday night and, in no uncertain terms, told Trump to go fuck himself, he shows up to the studio on Monday already singing a conciliatory tone. It is spectacularly sad to see, as we were getting so bored of the hours and hours of him bending over backward to defend Trump, and we were excited about the prospect that the show may be heading in a new direction.

Alas, it is not to be. Alex is still going to support Trump, it seems:

There is an interesting trend going on where Alex appears to be getting close to abandoning the world, and encouraging his audience to head to the woods:

This is a natural development for any doomsday cult, and realistically, Alex has had all the elements for a long time:

*Alex has an imaginary group of enemies that are oppressing him. Any misfortune that befalls him, generally the end result of some mistake he's made or some crime he's committed, gets to be blamed on these "Globalists."
*Alex has a designated savior in the person of Donald Trump. When his savior fails to vanquish his imaginary enemies, this will lead to a massive disillusionment, which is generally where cults go very bad.
*Alex's early career is characterized by him being a David Koresh-apologist. While it is true that the government behaved a bit inappropriately in the case of Waco, it also cannot be disputed that Koresh was leading a violent and internally abusive cult. Alex never talks about that second part, only focusing on the first part, in an effort to exonerate Koresh.
*A large part of Alex's paranoia and fear about the world relate to him either misunderstanding or intentionally misrepresenting technological progress. This is a technique that cult leaders often use to instill fear and loyalty from their followers.
*Everything Alex says is about an "Us Vs. Them" mentality, where "We" are the good people and "They" are literal demons who can't speak anymore and are beyond saving. This sort of dichotomy really only serves to make a listener/follower feel desperate enough to make irrational decisions that serve this vague idea of "Us" (which always just boils down to giving Alex money).

Anyway, this is an interesting trend to keep an eye on.

Another thing that is worth keeping an eye on is Alex seemingly encouraging Trump to take action on his "enemies" using the military:

What Alex is describing is tyranny. What he is advocating for is exactly what it looks like when a dictator tries to consolidate power. This is a profoundly pathetic thing for Alex to be saying, especially two days after he got on air and said this same would-be dictator "shoves ISIS up his dirty asshole," and that he is "shit on [Alex's] shoe." I would be more upset, but "profoundly pathetic" is about par for the course with Alex these days.

One last thing to note is that Alex is continuing his trend of claiming that things his ex-wife Kelly tweets about him are being said by the "mainstream media:"

[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1523995651313-5CD7PWGSXR9S1O2M3S2P/art.JPG|thumb|none]]

Literally no one in "the media" is reporting that Alex got his start with Art Bell. No one is even really tying them together, with the exception of his ex-wife, on Twitter. This tells me that he is absolutely stalking her on there and knows that it would make him sound too weak if he got mad about things she was saying, so he pretends "the media" is saying it.

This is the second time in a few weeks that he has very clearly done this, the last time being when Kelly tweeted about Alex getting a boost in his early career from Sinclair Broadcasting. While we do not take sides in personal matters, it is very important to note that Alex does seem to be exhibiting obsessive behaviors, while refusing to be real about what he is responding to on air. Again, "not being real" is pretty par for the course with Alex.
