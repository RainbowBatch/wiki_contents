And that was a very strategic decision on my part, because December 2003 is when Saddam Hussein ends up being found. That's right. And so I would love to see the lead up to that and how Alex responds, right when Saddam has found because as we know, Alex believes that he's in Belarus. Yeah, with his kids and a bunch of gold.

    | text      = He's not not even in the past. December 2003. Still not good? Not not good. Unfortunate. So before we get to today's episode, I wanted to touch on something from our last episode, and that is we talked about Alex's coverage of the medical assistance Dying legislation in Canada. Yeah, and I wanted to loop back and touch back on that here a little bit before we launch into 2003. I don't believe that we said anything that I disagree with, necessarily, in hindsight, but I did get some messages from listeners that have been really helpful in terms of illustrating ways that we could have discussed that issue better. And from a broader perspective, one of the points we could have done a better job of stressing is that there is an inadequate social safety net in terms of support for people living with disabilities in Canada. And this is a very severe issue when it comes to the point where poverty ends up being a contributing factor towards someone wanting to pursue made the case of Miramar sued, who he discussed on the last episode involved that dynamic where his disability payments weren't enough to keep them out of poverty, and weren't enough to allow them to find a place to live, which would leave him living with severe pain on housed. We did talk about how his case illustrates the need for greater social welfare. But I wasn't really aware of the endemic problem that advocates around disability related issues had been raising around the intersection of poverty and disability, and how this makes the expansion of made to include people whose deaths aren't reasonably imminent, could contribute towards a program that's dangerously close to eugenics. This is really important stuff. And I'd like to learn more about it and possibly talk to someone who knows more in the future. My coverage of Alex's content on the subject has a tendency to sometimes not see all of the broader context and implications of a story, because I'm looking at what he's saying, and then evaluating that. So my apologies for not stressing some of the more important aspects of what rational people's complaints about made actually are. There's real critique and an Alex critique. Yeah, and I'm focusing on the ALEKS critique. And sometimes, that means I don't see some of the more reasonable criticisms. Yeah, it's

}}

{{TranscriptBlock
    | name      = Dan
    | timestamp = 00:12:00.000
    | text      = Yeah, and some of that's the challenge. And some of that is just, you know, you miss something sometimes it has. That being said, I do think that some of our conversation was surrounding the, the question of how social safety net and welfare programs would be a solution to some of the confounding factors that were being discussed. In these cases, though, I think we could have done a better job of highlighting and focusing in on what some of those problems were right. Now, the second problem, which I actually think is a bit bigger is that there have been some reported cases of people with disabilities being offered made, as opposed to them pursuing it. Further Canadian laws have not built in oversight and regulations that many feel would be needed to make sure that that kind of care is being applied responsibly. And that's a really big concern. I do think that advocates and human rights experts have a valid point when they say that this legislation does have the potential to have a dehumanizing effect on people with disabilities, and in essence, create a perception whether in the mind of the public or in the medical profession, that their lives are somehow less worth living. And that is definitely unacceptable. I'm not sure what the answer is. But I'm going to read more up on this and try to listen to folks with better perspectives. But I am confident in my opposition to Alex's coverage of the story. The takeaway that I have is that there are more reasons to take this seriously. And that Alex cover Alex's coverage paints a cartoonish version of the problem and exists in direct opposition to the most logical elementary solution to helping some parts of this, which is a greater social investment in lifting people out of poverty. Yeah. And so for anybody who took issue with some of our commentary I do, I apologize that there was a slice of this and a section of it that that was missing fair. And I hope we'll do a better job of being mindful of a lot of that stuff. You know, in future instances,

    | text      = So I suspect that cops are more affected by Alex's earlier documentaries. Because those films are kind of veiled threats against the police. They're essentially arguing that the police are the strong arm of the globalists and will be used to enslave the population and thus will be the Patriots enemy. And unless they're explicitly on the side of the Patriots, the message is essentially when things go bad, we will kill you unless you're on our side, right? It's the same messaging and a ton of militia materials. For instance, the book unintended consequences involves a plot to assassinate law enforcement carried out by patriots who've had enough of gun grabbing. This isn't necessarily what you'd call a direct threat. But it also definitely has an undertone in these materials, that it might seem to help explain why they resonate so strongly with people in law enforcement. They're more or less telling any viewer in law enforcement that there's a war coming that the Patriots will win, and they need to decide if they want to be one of the good guys, or they want to die as a villain. And, you know, it's a very emotional appeal that's made in those documentaries too. And you could see, if you're a cop, you might identify with the people being labeled a villain and be like, I don't want to be a villain. Sure. I don't know.

I was sort of curious about this, but it seems like it's not a mystery worth solving. So I left it alone. He's a big time Zionist occupied government type of conspiracist. And that's his underlying theory about 911. Right. I found a page under the name Eric Schmidt on the site, clip it, which seemed like it had some pretty offensive content on it, but I wasn't sure if I was going to use it for this episode, on the off chance that it wasn't this guy's page. Sure. However, I was able to satisfy my own doubts by doing a little bit of cross referencing, for instance, to the audio clips he's posted on that page are about Carly Franz, a woman who has made allegations about being ritualistically abused by the Masons. Incidentally, on his own website, huge questions.com. Eric routinely talks about France and her allegations. Because I was able to find overlaps like this. I'm pretty confident that this is his audio page. Actually, I know for sure it is. So that means I'm going to play this anti semitic trash for you.

And so there's a crypto element to the conversation that they're having about 911. And if you just listen to this on critically, then you just be like, Oh, this guy thinks the buildings were blown up or whatever. Yeah, when in reality, what Alex is doing is mainstreaming, elevating and normalizing somebody who's essentially blaming Jewish people for 911.

So the plane the plan, no crash did not damage the building all that much.

Some people have been so convinced of this, that they're stretching their penis to make it bigger, such as Roberto Cabrera and businesses are offering products for penis stretching. And one of the questions on the Amazon site that sells the David Archie underwear is from man who's hoping that the underwear will make his penis look larger. The children who grew up in the USA could pick up the attitude that men should have giant penises, and that women should have giant breasts or how many people actually want such features and their spouse? Furthermore, are those people quote normal? Or are they mentally ill do quote normal women actually care whether a man has a large floppy.

Some of it masked in a pretend opposition to Zionism. Some of it just masked in a Oh, scientific bullshit. Yeah, right. The and you know, that is unacceptable on 100 different levels. Yeah. Then you poke around a little bit more in the site and you find this ridiculous shit like the Katy Perry video review being contextualized as Jewish people having Popstar sex slaves? Yeah, whatever. Yeah, then you go a little bit further and you find this nonsense. And you're like this is I just don't know what to do. Yeah, how do I not share? This is what I'm saying. Yeah, it is.

In no way does that excuse the direction that it goes to? No, no, no, of course. But I think that also this big floppy penis underwear review, it highlights another thing that I think is is crucial that you start to see, and that is like with Alex, he's a fucking monster who puts out hateful, bigoted material, oftentimes, crypto in nature, sometimes hiding behind other rationales for things. But he also sings along with the highway man, right. And he also talks over you belong to the city. And he also likes sci fi to an unhealthy extent like there's other facets of his personality. Michael Savage came up earlier, and I used to listen to a ton of Michael savages show and he's a horrific bigot as well. But sometimes he tells a story, and he can weave an amazing yarn about old time San Francisco eatery. Sure, and stuff like that. Like there are other facets of these people's personalities that sometimes are, are like, This is bizarre. bigot people aren't only a bigot. Sure. And that is also part of what makes them that makes some people be distracted from their bigotry. Right.

So Alex is making money off getting the audience to support and buy Eric's materials. Yep. Now, when we talk about Sandy Hook stuff, one of the things that is really important to consider in terms of it, a lot of people like to say, Oh, he was wrong about something. And then he apologized. Why is it so bad? But when you really look back at this period, and you look at the way that Alex was funneling his audience to support Wolfgang how big in facilitate his ability to carry out the harassment? Yeah, to fight the legal battles that that he was in the way Alex directed. And I advocated for his audience to give them money. Yeah. And the way that Alex sold their stuff on his website, that is a relevant piece of this through the machine that Alex has built, and the audience trust and access that he has, he has, like, given extreme people access to money that they would not have otherwise. Wolfgang Halbig didn't have access to a giant platform before Alex allowed that. Eric Schmidt was on public access interviews and shit. Like he didn't like even Alex in 2003 was probably a big gig for him. Yeah, yeah. And so this is a piece of what Alex is and does without him. I mean, nowadays, it's probably diminished somewhat, because there's so many internet based platforms that have large audiences and stuff, but at a relevant period of time like this and into the early 2000 10s. Like Alex was something that was able to be a monetary victory for these extremists, able to be on Alex's show led to, you know, probably access to a lot of stuff you wouldn't have access to otherwise, how old

No. Anyway, we come to the end of this episode, and like I said, a little bit shorter. But you know what, sometimes you end up reading a lot of an assholes blog. I do think that it's really important to recognize this stuff, though. This guest is such a great illustration of this. Sort of the counterpoint to the argument that Alex's show didn't used to be so bigoted wasn't like that stuff. No, it was baked in it was there. Yeah. The perception of it might not have been as easily accessible by a passive viewer. Yeah, but it was there. Yeah, sure.
