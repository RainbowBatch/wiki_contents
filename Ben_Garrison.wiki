'''Ben Garrison''' is perhaps the most prominent conservative political cartoonist alive today.

Incidentally, he's also terrible at political cartooning. It's not even that his conservative worldview is what makes the cartoons bad, it's more that he has a strange habit of labeling everything in his cartoons which is really the sign of a lack of craft. If the point you're trying to make isn't clear without labels on everything, it may be a sign that you need to work harder.

Garrison has appeared on [[InfoWars]] in a silly cowboy hat.
