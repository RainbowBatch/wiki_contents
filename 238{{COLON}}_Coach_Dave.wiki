Today, Dan and Jordan introduce another possible Wacky Wednesday candidate, suggested by Policy Wonk Ian. This episode covers a man named [[Dave Daubenmire|Coach Dave]], someone who may or may not be a coach, but definitely hosts a surreal extremist Christian radio show. Unfortunately, a little exploration reveals that there's a lot more than religion going on in his broadcasts.
