Today, Dan and Jordan take a break from [[Alex Jones]] to take a look at a fun little stretch from the career of Alex's predecessor, [[Bill Cooper]]. In this installment, the gents discuss the time that Bill decided that he and his listeners were going to buy a giant media conglomerate and thereby save America.

==Tidbits==

*Viacomm is not an option
*GE is out of reach
*The establishment will block us
*CBS is grabbable
*Turner Broadcasting is very doable
*Let's get Gannett!
*Time Warner is even better
*Good plan, poor execution
*Buy Time Warner, get Turner
*Sign the proxy vote over to me, you idiots
*Bill has only one phone line
*Caller: don't get your hopes up
*Next day: time to buy Gannett!
*Caller: I bought shares!
*Bill's business plan
*We have less than a year to buy the media before [[Bill Clinton]] destroys the country
*Caller: Jews control the media
*Jews control the media because you let them
*Caller: even if we don't take over, we'll make money
*By 1994: the plan is not going well
*Cohost: Carolyn Nelson
*Bill is angry at a newspaper
*Gun crime is hegelian dialectic
*This is your fault, listener
*Now we need 15%
*Once more with feeling

*Put up or shut up
